Wales' representatives are afraid to look stupid.
Some members of the representative have been confused by the proposal that their name should be changed to MWP, a member of the Wales Parliament (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
Kohu started with the plan to change the name of the representative into the Wales Parliament.
The members of the Office are concerned, regardless of the party size, that the change can make them embarrassed.
According to a representative of the Labour Party, the group is concerned that the name "sing with the words Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: in Wales, twp means stupidity and pwp means cake.
According to a representative of the Plaid Party, the majority of the group is "not satisfied" and has proposed other options.
According to the representative of the Conservative Party, his group takes the word change "in the open mind", but points out that the word MWP is a short word for a stupid word.
In the Wales language, w-letters are pronounced in this context in the same way as Yorkshire's U-letters.
The Commission of the Representation for the necessary legislative change in the name said as follows: "The final decision on the headings of the Representation is, of course, to the members themselves."
The Wales Administration Act of 2017 empowers the representative to change its name.
In June, the Commission published an opinion question on proposals that broad support was given to the appointment of a representative as the Wales Parliament.
The Commission favours the members of the Wales Parliament or the WMP shortcut, but the MWP option was most supported in public opinion polls.
Apparently, the members of the Office propose alternative headings, but the lack of consensus may cause major concern to President Elin Jones, who is expected to have a legislative proposal for amendments within a few weeks.
The legislation on changes also includes other changes in the activities of the representative, such as the loss of representation and the rules on the form of the committee system.
In the legislative process, the members of the representative may give their final vote on the heading under which they should be called.
The Macedonians will go to the elections in a referendum on the change of the name of the country
On Sunday, the voters will vote on whether the name of the country will be changed to the "North Macedonian Republic".
The referendum seeks to resolve decades of conflict with the neighbouring country of Greece, which also has its own country called Macedonia.
Athens has long reiterated that the name of the North Neighbourhood is practically a regional requirement for its own region and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO membership efforts.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the referendum, said that he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, reason that the name change is simply the price payable for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's watches slow down when the churches of Harlem live in difficult times
"Aging people with whom I have discussed say that before every corner of the street there was a bar or church," says Adams.
"Now there's neither of them."
He said that losing bars is understandable.
He said, "The relationship with humans has changed."
"The bars are no longer shared living rooms in the neighborhood, in which people meet regularly."
In the case of the churches, he is concerned that the sale of the property is not as far as the leaders think, "and sooner or later they have returned to the starting box."
He added that the churches could be replaced by dwellings and apartments that people living are not those that would support the remaining sanctuaries in the neighborhood.
"Unavoidably more people who buy dwellings in these buildings will be white," he says, "and so they will have a day when these churches shut their doors forever, because it is unlikely that most people moving into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became the Black community - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins decades later.
The original White Methodist Church moved away in the 1930s.
Nearly active blackmen’s congregation acquired the property of the building.
St Martins took over the black congregation under the leadership of Pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against the merchants of the central Harlem street 125th Street against the opposed hire or promotion of these blacks.
In 1939, the fire that was ignited damaged seriously to the building, when Father Johnson’s congregations planned to rebuild, they introduced a tower game.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor in St. Martins, proudly called the tower watch game "the watch of the throat."
In July, an expert on the Tornello game called it a second name: "cultural heritage" and "unreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert at Michigan University Tiffany Ng also pointed out that it was the world’s first black musician playing towerbell game. It was Dionisio A. Lind who moved to Riverside church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martins didn't replace him.
In St. Martins, in recent months, there has been a complex swing that has contributed to the work of the church's landlords and, on the other hand, the architects and contractors who were hired by the episcopic hippie.
In July, the government body of the Sakast - the directors of the congregation - wrote to the Shift Society its concern that the Shift would "strive to reverse costs" to the Sakash, even though the Sakast had not participated in the hire of architects and contractors sent by the Shift.
Some congregations complained about the lack of transparency in the matter of the swiftness.
Shark damaged 13-year-olds in California
The authorities tell us that the hay attacked a 13-year-old boy and hurt him when he dived hummers on the opening day of the Humber season in California.
The attack took place on Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before morning seven.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB-TV that he was diving with his friends on Saturday morning about half an hour when he heard the boy shouting help. He and a group of others went to the boy to help him out of water.
Hammel told me first that he thought that he was only excited after catching the hummer, but then he realized this shouting, "I was bite!"
I got bite!'
When he got to the boy, Hammel says he noticed that this whole cell bone had been broken open.
"I shouted everyone out of the water: there is a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was taken to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is reported to be critical.
The species of the attacked shark is unknown.
At the media event, Captain Larry Giles said that a shark had been detected a few weeks earlier, but it was found to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim had severe injuries to his upper body.
The authorities closed the beaches from Casablad Ponto Beach to Ecinitas Swam for 48 hours for research and safety reasons.
Giles noted that there are over 135 hailers in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans for the UK's beauty care sector
Sainsbury's will challenge Boots, Superdrugin and Debenham's goods stores in the beauty care department with expert advice.
This is a significant move towards a well-being sector worth GBP 2.8 billion, which continues to grow, even though the sales of fashion and household goods are declining. Larger beauty care departments are being tried in 11 stores across the country and will be extended to other stores next year.
They invest in beauty care products because the supermarkets are trying to fill the floor space previously reserved for television, microwave and home goods.
Sainsbury's tells us that its selection of beauty care products will double to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space, and they get their own brand-specific area like Boots stores.
The supermarket will also relaunch its boutique makeup menu. In the future, the majority of products will be vegan friendly because young shoppers are increasingly demanding it.
The Fragrance Shop also experiments with rental stores in two Sainsbury's stores. The first was opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will be opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Internet shopping and switching to small retail shops will force the supermarkets to invent new attractions for customers.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe has said that stores will look more like goods houses when the supermarket chain fights against cheap shops like Ald and Lidl by increasing services and other than food products.
After buying the two chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores in its stores, and also Habitat stores. The company reports that this has promoted the sale of food and made purchases profitable.
The supermarket failed in its previous company to reform its beauty care and pharmacy departments.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots at the beginning of the 21st century, but cooperation ended on how to share the yields of pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy follows the business store where Sainsbury's sold 281 of its store’s pharmacy business to the Lloyds Pharmacy chain for 125 million pounds three years ago.
The company reported Lloyds to be part of the plan to extend the range of luxurious skin care products to four stores with labels such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Sainsbury's commercial director Paul Mills-Hicks said: "We have changed the appearance and atmosphere of our beauty care departments to improve customer experience.
We have also invested in specialised workers who are willing to advise customers.
Our selection of brands meets all needs and our attractive environments, as well as our convenient locations, make us a convincing beauty care shopping destination that challenges the traditional way to buy."
Peter Jones's "raid" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the 11 million pounds contract
Dragons Den star Peter Jones went out of "rage" when TV runner Holly Willoughby withdraws from the 11 million pounds contract with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home food and housing brand for Truly.
The two companies have been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand.
This Morning program, a 37-year-old contractor, announced his departure in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angry the Dragons Den star Peter Jones with their profitable lifestyle business in recent moments. He now intends to focus on his new gigantic agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources tell us that Jones was "raged" at a tense meeting last Tuesday, held at the headquarters of the Jones Business Empire in Marlow, Buckinhamshire. The stargirl of the TV had admitted that his new $1.5 million worth contract would not leave enough time for their home food and housing brand Truly.
The company has been compared with the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand and it was betrayed to double Willoughby's estimated worth 11 million.
After a 37-year-old Willoughby in Instagram said he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain from one of his homes.
According to a source, "Truly was clearly Holly's most important project.
It was his long-term plan to ensure his survival for the next two decades.
His decision of departure has left all the astonishment over.
No one could believe the events of Tuesday so close to the publication.
Marlow's headquarters has a warehouse full of products waiting for sale."
This Morning is one of the most reliable stars in the UK, and according to experts, his departure can cause the company millions of losses due to product investments, including everything from pillows to candles and clothing to household supplies, not to mention the delay in the publication.
It could mean the end of long friendship.
Three children's mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close for ten years with Jones and this wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby organized Cappin Truly in 2016 and Jones, a 52-year-old, became president in March.
Couples spend holidays together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is baked from M&S's new brand ambassador and he replaces Ant McPartlin's I'm A Celebrity program.
The source near Jones said last night, "We're not commenting on his business."
And then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism that he received in the media of his comments, which some considered inappropriate to the President, and of his appreciation for the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said, pretending to be a "newsanker" sound.
"I didn't give up."
He pointed out that Kim was interested in meeting again after Trump had thrilled the first meeting in July as a significant step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
However, nuclear negotiations have failed.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in July, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North will not see a "equivalent reaction" from the United States to the early disarmament measures in North Korea.
Instead, he said that the United States continued its sanctions, whose purpose is to maintain pressure.
Trump had a much more optimistic view of his speech.
"Northern Korea is doing great," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have such an excellent relationship."
He said that efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results, and the missile tests have been discontinued, hostages have been helped with freedom and the remains of American soldiers have been returned home.
He also defended his unusual style when talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of trying to get 10 000 more out there, we'll have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, showing the audience in front of him.
The Indonesian tsunami and the squad destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
For example, several foreign voluntary organisations were told that they were not needed in the aftermath of the Lomboki earthquake.
The national emergency required for international assistance was not declared, although about 10 per cent of Lomboki’s inhabitants had remained homeless.
"In many cases they have, unfortunately, made very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so the situation is a little challenging," said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is a traveling group, it is not certain whether foreign staff can work on the field.
The National Disaster Agency’s reporter Sutopo said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation of the return to see if international organisations were allowed to participate in assistance.
Indonesia remains unprepared to face natural forces, taking into account regular earthquakes.
Although tsunami protectors have been built in Aceh, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
There was probably a loss of human lives in return due to a tsunami warning siren, although the warning was valid.
Traveling between the numerous islands of Indonesia is challenging even under the best conditions.
Natural accidents make logistics even more complicated.
The hospital ship assigned to help the victims of the earthquake in Lombo is on the way to return, but lasts at least three days before it reaches a new accident area.
President Joko Widodo made the centre of his election campaign on the development of the past infrastructure in Indonesia and has provided money to improve roads and railways.
However, there has been a financial deficit in the administration of some countries, while the new elections will be approaching next year.
Some pressures also increase tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority of the country has adopted a more old-fashioned form of religion.
Christians and Muslim angels have been fighting streets with jungle knives, boog guns and arrows, as well as with other initial weapons, leading to more than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands have had to leave their homes.
See: Daniel Sturridge in Liverpool dropped a late scalp against Chelsea
On Saturday, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool's loss in the selection team after painting 89 minutes on the Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a feed from Xherdan Shaqir 27 out of Chelsea's goal when his team was in the defeat position.
He moved the ball to the left before he took the gun to the back of the gun.
The shooting was over the high penalty area towards the right upper bucket.
Finally, the ball fell over the throwing Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I just tried to make myself playable to get the ball and players like Shaq always play as much as possible upwards, so I just tried to create as much time as possible for myself," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, I took one touch and triggered without thinking too much."
Chelsea led the game in the mid-time 1-0 after the Belgian Eden Hazard painted in 25 minutes.
The Blues tip gave Mateo Kovacic, in the situation, a feed-up before running away near the center and spurting to Liverpool's field side.
Kovacic played a quick wall feed in the middle of the field.
And then he released Hazard to the penalty zone with a great throughput.
Hazard escaped from the defense and passed Liverpool by the left foot of Alisson Becker in the backbone.
Liverpool meets the champions' league block on Wednesday at the 15th San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will meet at the UEFA European League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of victims of tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832 dead
On Sunday, the Indonesian disaster agency reported that the number of deaths of the earthquake and tsunami had risen to 832 victims.
At the press conference, the agency’s reporter Sutopo Purwo reported that many had been trapped in the ruins of the collapsed buildings, when the 7.5 magnitudes earthquake struck on Friday and raised up to six meters high waves.
The fragments of the Romahed buildings spread widely into the city of Palu, with 380,000 inhabitants.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of a murder after finding a woman stuck dead.
The woman's body found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning started a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was found stuck at 7.55 at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect of murder.
The police ask people in the area to register if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is in his initials, but I appeal to all those in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also appeal to all, especially taxi drivers who may have recorded something on the machineboard video, to contact the police. They may have vital information for the investigation."
The police's female reporter has confirmed that the woman found dead comes from Birkenhead and that the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, there have been people who may have known a woman who have asked her where she was found.
When the investigation continues, the police tell us that they are trying to inform the victim about what happened.
The taxi driver in Grayson Mews had just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police had told me that no one would be allowed in or out of the building.
He was unwise when he found out what had happened.
The people have just found out that they can go hours before they let them back in.
One officer was told to tell the man that the whole area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
There was a tearing woman at the scene.
He repeated that "it's awful."
There were two countries in the isolated area at two afternoons, and there was another third outside.
There were a number of police officers in the isolated area overseeing the floor.
Anyone who knows something is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or to call the anonymous Crimestoppers number 0800 555 111 using a confession 247 September 30.
Parliament's Cromwell statue was part of the history rewriting book
It would be a poetic right to cast a statue, given that his own fanatic puritan collectors destroyed England’s cultural and religious monuments as well as the best Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as "typery" and "rewrite history".
President of the Cromell Society, John Goldsmith, said: "It was inevitable that the ongoing debate on the removal of statues would make a painting of Oliver Cromwell's statue in front of the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell didn't command and execute Iconoclasm in the civil wars.
The wrong Cromwell might suffer from the actions of his ancestor Thomas, who lived in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's marvelous description of Cromwell expresses the views of the 1800s and it is historical evidence of a character that many still consider to be worthy of praise.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Much, although perhaps more in the 1800s than today, believe Cromwell as a defender of Parliament against the external pressure which, of course, caused monarchy in this case.
If this is a precise description of the subject, then, is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
At least it is certain that in the mid-1900s, the dispute has formulated a further development of our nation. Cromwell, in turn, has to identify a character that represents the other side of that division.
In addition, his achievement as a state administrator deserves praise and memory."
The killer squaded by the death of a Chinese farmer
Local media tells us that the pig attacked the farmer and killed him on the marketplace in Southwest China.
Only the body of the man named "Yuan" was found near the pig on the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou. The man’s artery had been broken and he was on top of blood, the South China Morning Post newsed on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005 Xining, Qinghain Province, China, is prepared to vaccinate pigs in pigs.
He was told about traveling with his cousin from the nearby Yuna province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the marketplace.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also noticed the close swine door was open.
In the silk, he said he saw a big hair with a mouth in the blood.
According to the news, the criminal investigation confirmed that a 250-kilo animal was killed by a farmer.
The Guiyang Evening News magazine tells a cousin called "Wu" said that "my cousin's feet were bloody and exfoliated."
The surveillance camera photo looks like a cousin comes to the market to feed pigs on Thursday morning at 4.40.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed a man was not a part of Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market leaders told Evening News that the pig had been locked down so that it would not harm other police when collecting evidence at the venue.
The Yuan family and the market authorities are told to negotiate compensation for death.
The pigs are known to have attacked people before, although it is rare.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 300 kg swine shined the Walesian farmer against this tract until the wife succeeded in shaking the animal.
An oregonian farmer was eaten to his pigs in 2012. After the event, the farmer living in Manitoba told the CBC News channel that although the pigs are not usually aggressive, the blood taste can function as a "starter".
"They're just playful.
They're like little children, very curious, and they're not meant to hurt.
They just need to be properly respected," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring a wide range of heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is deteriorating, predicted, when moving over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the next few days, however, Rosa will bring floods to North Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Rosa’s wind speed was 38 meters per second, or a first - class hurricane, Sunday at 5 o'clock, and it was located 620 miles southwest of Red Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, there is a low pressure over the Pacific, which is heading east towards the US West Coast. On Monday, when Rosa arrives in the California Peninsula as a tropical storm, it begins to run deep tropical humidity north towards the US southwest.
Rosa will bring up to 250 millimetres of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, the tropical humidity that interacts with the approaching low pressure will form large rain areas southwest in the next few days.
Locally, rain levels of 25 to 100 millimetres cause dangerous heavy rainflows and possibly earth-drawns in the wilderness.
In certain landing areas, deep tropical humidity causes 50-75 mm rain per hour, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
For certain areas, and especially for Arizona, it is expected to rain up to 50-100 mm.
Heavy rain flows are possible and the conditions may quickly weaken due to the fragmentation of tropical rain.
The threat of tropical rain is strongly recommended to avoid walking into the wilderness.
Heavy rains can transform the canions into rivers flowing in the rivers and storms produce local winds and flying dust.
The approaching low pressure area brings local heavy rainfall to the coastlines of South California.
More than 10 millimetres of rain are possible, causing small waste flows and slides you.
It would be the first rainfall for the rainy season in the region.
Raising tropical rainbows begin to approach Arizona late Sundays and early Mondays until rains expand during Mondays and Tuesdays.
The heavy rain spreads to Four Corners on Tuesday and lasts all Wednesday.
In October, the United States has seen strong swellings in temperatures when the Arctic region is cooled, but the tropics remain rather warm.
This sometimes causes large temperature swellings at short distances.
In the middle of the United States there is an excellent example of great temperature differences on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference between Kansas City, Missour and Omaha and Nebraska, St. Louis and Iowan Des Moines at almost 20 degrees.
The delaying heat of the summer will strive again to strengthen and expand in the next few days.
At the beginning of October, the temperature is expected to be widely warm in the central and eastern parts of the United States, with a temperature of +26 degrees from south to north-east.
In New York, the temperature can hurt on Tuesday to +26 degrees, which would be about 4 degrees warmer than the average.
According to our long-term forecast, the eastern parts of the United States have good opportunities for higher average temperatures in the first half of October.
More than 20 million watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
On Tuesday, more than 20 million watched the six television channels broadcast by the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, accused of sexual crime in the 1980s, gave their fascinating testimony.
At the same time, the political downturn continued when television companies interrupted their broadcast at the last moment, the FBI conducts a week-long investigation of charges on the basis of a contract arranged by Senator Jeff Flake.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs that he was 100% sure that the drunk Kavanaugh snatched him and tried to take his clothes off in the high school.
Kavanaugh, for his part, gave an emotional witness statement saying that he was 100% sure that this was not happening.
There were probably more viewers than Nielsen reported on Friday 20.4 million.
The company lowered the average of the viewers on the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
The number of other channels that had been sent by the opportunity, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, was not available immediately.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulties in measuring viewers in offices.
Some of the measurements tell us that the reading corresponds to the number of American football games or Oscar gaala viewers.
According to Nielsen, the largest audience of all television companies was on Fox News Channel, whose opinions have strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh. The channel had an average of 5.69 million audiences throughout the day.
ABC was second with 3,26 million watchers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
After hearing, the interest was still high.
On Friday, there was Flake in the middle of the drama.
The cameras of CNN and CBS described how the demonstrators shouted him on his way to the hearing of the Committee on Justice on Friday.
The CNN looked straight on how he stood at a minute's view down when the rings were flying.
"I'm standing right in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you believe he will tell the people the truth?
"You have power when so many women are powerless," he was told."
Flake said that his office had issued an opinion and, before closing the elevators, he added that he would have more to tell after the committee was consulted.
Hourly later, the cable and universal networks were sent directly when the Committee on Legal Affairs began to vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate plenary.
Flake, however, said that he only worked in the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate in the next week, as the minority democrats have demanded.
Flake was convinced by his friend, Senator Chris Coons, on the basis of the discussions he had held.
Flake made his decision after discussing Coons and many other senators.
Flake's choice had power because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of Brexit's policymaking
In the interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accuses people who criticize EU divorce plans of policy that threatens the future and national interests of Britain.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In addition to May's interview, another interview was published on the front page of the newspaper, in which his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on May's so-called Chequers plan. Johnson calls on the proposal that the UK and the EU would collect each other's import duties to be "unreasonable".
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson suspected of the death of a LSU player
The police have arrested a suspect in LSU for shooting a 20-year-old Wayde Sims death.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and transferred to jail, and the Baton Rouge police department says he's being charged with murder of second grade.
The authorities published a video of the Sims and Simpson interrogation, where the police report that Sims lost his glasses.
The police found the glasses at the venue and told me they found Simpson's DNA, says WAFB.
The police tell us Simpson's admitting Wayde's shooting in interrogations.
According to the Advocate magazine, his guarantee amount was set at $350,000.
On Friday, a preliminary report was published by the East Baton Rouge County Death Inquiryer, stating that the cause of death was a shooting wound on the neck.
The Agency thanks the State Police Force of Louisiana, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the residents of the region for the assistance of the investigation led to arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU’s Director of Sport, thanked the law enforcement authorities for their "purpurity and enforcement".
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-meter attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his Wayne father played basketball in LSU'ss.
He recorded an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 record balls in the last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that Friday morning he was "depressed" and "upset" about Wayde's death.
"You're always afraid of something like this," Wayde said.
The volcano is rushing ashes over Mexico City
The ash departing from the Popocatepetl mountain has reached the southern residential areas of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the Mexico Disaster Prevention Centre urged citizens to stay away from the volcano, when the crater's operation accelerated and 183 gas and ashes discharges had been registered during the day.
The center registers grains and vibrations several times.
In the social media, pictures were published where, in residential areas such as Mexico City Xochimilco, car windscreens covered a thin ash layer.
Geophysics have observed an increase in volcano activity located south-west of the capital 72 km after the earthquake of 7.1 magnitud in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan parates gather together before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, in Barcelona, six persons were arrested at the meeting of demonstrators for independence and the Melilla police, with thousands participating in competitive demonstrations on the first anniversary of the divergent vote.
The police held the group of defenders of masked independence, who threw the police with eggs and powder paints, which formed dark dust clouds on streets normally filled with tourists.
Throughout the day, there were more bugs when the police used their bulbs to control the bulbs.
The contacts between the defenders of independence and the Unionist groups continued for several hours, when the previous people cried "no forget, no forgiveness" and the latter "to live Spain".
The local press reports that 14 people have received treatment for small injuries in demonstrations.
The excitement is still on the surface in the area of independence, after a year after the referendum on 1 October, which Madrid declares illegal, but which the Catalan parates celebrate.
The voters chose independence with a clear majority, although participation in the boycott against the difference was low.
According to the Catalan authorities, in last year's violent controversies, nearly 1,000 people were injured when the police tried to prevent voting in locations across the region.
The independent groups stayed outside on Friday to prevent a demonstration supporting the national police.
However, the demonstration was organized, but it had to go on another route.
Narcis Termes, 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist demonstration with his wife, said that there is no longer hope for Catalonia's independence.
"The last year we experienced one of the best moments of our life."
I saw my parents cry out of the joy of voting, but now we're stuck," he says.
In December last year, the speed of political parties in favour of Catalonia's independence has slowed down. Many of the most famous leaders are in voluntarily escaped or arrested to wait for the trial of their involvement in the organization of a referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who described the police-supporting demonstration on his phone, says that on both sides of the politicians, there is a dispute.
"Your position is getting extorted all the time," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the Catalonian leaders in detention since the last nine years, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
"To become a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the breaking of democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government," he says.
Londonderry: Men were arrested in a car crashed in the house
Men of 33, 34 and 39 years of age were arrested after it was reported that the car was repeatedly crashed in Londonderry.
The events took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 UK time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.

Livingston won the Rangers 1-0 Menga goal
Dolly Menga's first goal in Livingston secured victory
Serialist Livingston surprised Rangers and only caused Steven Gerrard a second loss in 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox Society.
In the end, the goal of Dolly Menga was enough to win when Gary Holt's team went up to the second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's crew missed the season's first visitor victory at Premiership. Next Sunday, it will meet Comic Director Hearts, which is eight points ahead.
The Rangers will still meet in the Rapid Vienna European League on Thursday.
Livingston, for his part, continued his unforfeited tube in the series to six matches already. Main coach Holt has not yet lost once since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost places in response to a visitor suffering from a lack of steel
Holt's team should have led long before his goal after he had caused the Rangers bad difficulties with his head.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finish went wide, and then Alan Lithgow slipped into Craig Halkett's bag, but passed the ball.
The hosts gave the ball management to Rangers with favor because they knew they could vaccinate from special situations.
That's exactly how the important goal came.
The Rangers led Livingston to a free shot, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson played Menga a place where he was able to move the ball to the center of the penalty area and finish.
Until then, the Rangers had held the ball, but found the home team to keep the defense, and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly able to try.
The same pattern continued in the second half of the time, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to fight.
Rangers' goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped Scott Pittman's company and Lithgow passed the ball from another special situation in Livingston.
The hundred centers of the Livingston Penalty area were constantly cleaned up, and the two situations required foreclosure - Halket's tacled exchangeman Glenn Middleton and the ball hit in the hand.
"Super performance from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotlanni Alasdair Lamont Tony Macaroni
Great performance and results from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and was excellent from every player, continuing from the rises through.
The team's way of playing and the crew have hardly changed its way back to the highest level of series.However, Holt has to be recognized for the way he has strengthened the team since he arrived.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great in leading excellently organized defence, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his toes the whole fight.
The Rangers did not have any ideas.
The team has sometimes performed really well under Gerrard, but now stayed far from his level of demand.
The last move left tired, and they managed to open the home team defense only once. This should act as a wake-up to the Rangers, which is the middle-success of the serial table.
Erdogan received a varied reception in Cologne
The smile was sensitive and the sky was blue on Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at correcting the relations of NATO allies.
There have been differences on human rights and freedom of the press as well as on Turkey's EU ambitions.
Erdogan continued his journey to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police prevented 25,000 supporters from meeting in front of the mosque, justifying it for security reasons, but there were still a lot of supporters gathered close to the president.
Hundreds of Erdogania’s opponents - many of whom were Kurds - also brought their voice to their voices, condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
Contesting demonstrations reflect the division of opinions, and some German Turkish people greet him as a hero when others disgrace him as self-powered.
Road accident in Deptford: The biker dies in a collision with a car
The biker died when he hit a car in London.
The accident occurred around ten local times in the morning, south of Deptford, near the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street cross, with bustling traffic.
The driver stopped and the care staff came to help the victim, but the man died at the scene.
A few months earlier, another cyclist died in a traffic escape accident on Childers Street, about a mile from the accident site on Saturday.
The city police say they're trying to identify the man and inform his loved ones.
There are road blocks and bus traffic has been controlled elsewhere, and drivers have been urged to avoid the area.
Long Lart Prison: Six guards were injured in trouble
Prison officials tell us that six prison guards have been injured by a high level of security in prison unrest.
The unrest began at the HMP Long Lart prison in Worcestershire at about 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, British time and continues.
There have been special tornado police to calm down unrests behind eight prisoners in one prison wing.
The police's minor facial injuries were handled at the scene.
A prison reporter said: "HMP Long Lart prison has been sent to specially trained prison staff to take care of the situation.
Six staff members have been treated for their injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible are taken over by the police and they may have to spend longer periods of time."
There are over 500 prisoners in the HMP Long Lart prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
The prison manager was reported to have received hospital care in June after one of the prisoners had attacked him.
In addition, in October the police were alerted to prison due to serious unrests in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa brings a threat to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (dry areas can benefit)
It is rare to arrive in Arizona with tropical lows, but that is exactly what happens at the beginning of next week when the remains of Hurricane Rosa move across the southwestern week, bringing the risk of heavy rainfall.
The Kingdom Weather Service has already issued a warning of heavy rainfall on Monday and Tuesday from Western Arizona to south and east Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, as well as the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaffin, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosan is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and it arrives in the form of rain on Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted in its twiite. that only "only ten tropical storms have preserved the tropical storm or low pressure at a distance of 300 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was another hurricane at a distance of 65 kilometers from the Arizona border."
The most recent designs of the National Hurricane Centre predict rains of 50-100 millimetres. On the Mogollin brush in Arizona, it can rain up to 150 millimetres.
In other areas of the southwestern weekly, including the middle rock mountains and the Great Basin, a total of up to 100 mm can be rained.
Rosa rains can also be a blessing of dryness by testing the area if there is no risk of heavy rainfall.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some rain may be useful because the south lunch has suffered from severe dryness.
According to the United States Dryness Agency, more than 40% of Arizona suffers from at least extreme dryness, which is the second highest class, reports weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will take his route first on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning Rosa’s location is 620 km south of Mexico’s Red Eugenia. At that time, it is still a strong hurricane with a wind speed of 135 km per hour, moving north at 20 km per hour.
The storm loses its power when facing cooler waters in the Pacific.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico at a strong tropical storm during Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts of Mexico rains may be severe and cause a considerable flood risk.
"The California Peninsula is expected to be 75-150 mm northwest of Sonora, and up to 250 mm is possible," says weather.com.
Rosa then continues to travel through Mexico as a tropical storm before it arrives at the Arizona border as a tropical low pressure on Tuesday morning hours. From there it continues to travel through Arizona south to Utah by Tuesday late evening.
"The greatest risks of Rosa or its residues are associated with the very severe rainfall in the California Peninsula, northwest of Sonora and southwest of the United States," says the National Hurricane Agency.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening heavy rainfall and waste flows in deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for murder attempts
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for a murder attempt after a 16-year-old boy had been found in Somerset.
A teenager boy was found wounded in Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday morning four times in Britain.
He was taken to a hospital where he was reported to be in a "stable" condition.
The police say they arrested one 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old man in Radstock in Avon and Somerset.
The police ask for contact with all those who may have video material stored on a mobile phone on events.
Trump says that Kavanaugh's experienced democratic party has been the "happiness and anger"
"My voice in favour of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and shameful methods of the Democratic Party," Trump said at the meeting in Wheeling in Western Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered from the "ruth and anger" of the Democratic Party during his entire appointment process.
Kavanaugh witnessed in front of Congress on Thursday, He strongly and emotionally banned the accusation made by Christine Blasey Ford for sexual harassment that would have occurred decades ago in their teens.
Ford also witnessed his charge in hearing.
On Saturday, the President said "the Americans saw Kavanaugh's excellentness, nature and courage" that day.
"My vote in favour of strengthening the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote on one of the most rewarded legal doctrines of our time, with excellent seafarers of public service," he told his West Virginia supporters.
The President indirectly referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of the republican voting in the mid-election.
"We're five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
Not just campaigning, but campaigning full," he said.
"That's why I turn everywhere to fight for excellent candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats had taken the task of "resistance and prevention".
The Senior Assistant of the Republican Party Management informed CNN that the first important vote in the Kavanaugh appointment procedure is expected to be held in the Senate by Friday at the latest.
In Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, hundreds of deaths are expected to rise
On Saturday, the authorities reported at least 384 deaths of a great earthquake and tsunami to the island of Sulawes in Indonesia. Many of them wiped off with the giant waves that hit the beaches.
On Friday, hundreds of people had gathered at the festival on the shore of the return city, when even six meters high waves struck the shore at night. Many were rinsed to death when waves were destroyed.
Tsunami caused 7.5 magnitudes of earthquakes.
When the threat of tsunami appeared yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not escape as soon as they were the victims of it," reports BNPB’s reporter, Purwo Nugroho Jakarta.
"Tsunami did not come alone, but it pulled with cars, wooden frames, houses and hit all over the country," says Nugroho. He adds that the tsunami reached an open sea speed of 800 kilometers an hour before he attacked the coast.
Some people survived tsunami alive by climbing into trees, he says.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palau.
The air images published by the Agency show a number of destroyed houses and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
After the earthquakes, the coastal towns continued to shake on Saturday.
The earthquakes felt in the area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency BPPT issued an opinion that Friday’s massive earthquake-freed energy accounted for about 200 nuclear bombs that were dropped in Hiroshima’s Second World War.
It says that the landside of a long and narrow bay, at the end of the city, could have blown tsunamis.
Nugroho described the destruction as "large" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were crashed.
He told us that some of the victims had found their bodies in the ruins of broken buildings and added that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the deaths and the damages may be greater from the return to the north on the continuous coast, in the area called Donggala, which is closer to the centre of the storm.
Communication links "is completely crossed and there has been no information about Donggala", says Nugroho.
According to the opinion of the Red Cross, there are more than 300,000 people living there, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the Agency was widely criticised for not telling us that the tsunami hit the return, although the authorities said that the waves arrived during the warning.
In the amateur video distributed in the social media, the man on the upper floor of the building shouts vigorously warnings for the approaching tsunami to people on the street.
Only minutes later strikes the beach by a water wall that takes buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to verify the authenticity of the image.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a large power break that broke communication connections around the Fire, which made it difficult to coordinate public rescue operations.
The authorities say that the army has begun to send help from Jakarta and other cities with transportation machines, but the evacuated ones still need food and other basic supplies.
The city airport has been reopened only for relief operations and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodon was supposed to visit the Return evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
It's really bad.
The Donggala staff of the World Vision have secured the city of Palu, where they have been accommodated in the inner courtyards of the office. On their way they passed the scene of destruction, says Dozeba.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he says.
It's really bad.
At the start of their unconsolated task, some complained that foreign aid workers were prevented from travelling to return.
According to the provisions of Indonesia, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only start flowing once the disaster area has been declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"However, there is a provincial disaster," says Aulia Arriani, journalist of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says that "OK, this is a national disaster," we can start receiving international aid, but the declaration has not yet been made."
When the second night landed over Palu after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, the lost friends and family members had the hope that the wonders of their loved ones would differ from the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was lifted out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been in ruins for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, a coach of the Indonesian adjunct team, had trained two missing adjuncts for the Asian races that had ended this month.
The Roa Roa hotel was also caught by his students, says Mandagi.
"As a member of the adhesive, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Gendon says he was desperately trying to reach the return competitors who participated in the beach festival with WhatsApp messages after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel was spreading among the addiction community.
However, after the messages he sent, only one grey sign appeared instead of two blues.
"It means, I believe, that messages have not been delivered," he says.
The thieves took $26, 750 in connection with the bank machine supplement Newport on the Levee
The thieves took $26, 750 from the Brink's Guardian's employee on Friday morning when this was supplementing the Newport bank machine in the Levee.
The driver of the car had been cleaning and supplementing a bank machine located at the entertainment centre, detective Dennis McCarthy says in the newsletter.
When Brink's employee was on the other side, "this man ran behind him" who stole his money for delivery.
According to the report, witnesses saw a number of people fleeing from the scene, but the police did not specify their number.
Persons with information about their identity are requested to contact the Newport police in number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The laptop changes to Ye
The rapper Kanye West has changed his name Ye.
When he announced a change in Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The person formerly known as Kanye West".
Ye has been a 41-year-old West nickname for some time, and he also used it as the name of his eighth album published in June.
The change before his future appearance in the Saturday Night Live program, where he is expected to publish his new album called Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande in the program, who, according to the program's creator, canceled his participation for "sensitive reasons".
West has previously said that the word also has religious significance for him, in addition to being a shortener of his professional name.
Discussing the album earlier this year with the radio runner Big Boy, West said, "he believes that "ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and there its meaning is "yes".
"So I am you, we, and we all.
It started from Kanye, which means the only one, and ended up in a shorter form of Ye - which only expresses kindness, evil, confusion, everything in us.
The album is mainly thinking about who we are."
He's one of several known rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced to be popular with the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former partner JAY-Z has also deleted and returned the line and large letters.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use the army against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected President of Mexico, promised that he would never use military power against civilians.
Lopez Obrador, who appeared at the Tlatelolco Plaza square on Saturday, promised that "there would be no use of an army to oppress the people of Mexico."
Armed forces fired a peaceful demonstration on 2 October 1968, killing up to 300 people during the time when the left-wing student movements were rooting in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young people in Mexico by providing monthly student support and opening up more free public universities.
He said that the lack of unemployment and educational opportunities led young people to criminal gangs.
Community institutions should double the funding of artificial intelligence research
The United States should double the funding used to investigate artificial intelligence when China intensifies its activities in this field. This is what Google, Microsoft and Apple have said about funding and the artificial intelligence professional Kai-Fu Lee.
Prior to the opinion, notifications on the artificial intelligence of the various parts of the US administration were made, although there is no formal artificial intelligence strategy in the United States.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: it seeks to become the leading developer of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Doublering the budget for research in the field of intelligence would be a good start, considering that other countries are so much behind the United States, and that we are looking for the next breakthrough of artificial intelligence," says Lee.
The doubling of funding could double the probability that the next significant artificial intelligence will be carried out in the United States,” Lee explained in the CNBC interview this week.
Lee's book "The Great Powers of Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month through the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt publisher. He works as Managing Director in Sinovation Venture, which has invested one of China's most important Intelligent Company called Face++.
In the 1980s, he developed an artificial intelligence system at the University of Carnegie Mellon, which defeated the highest ranked Othello player in the United States. Later, he served as the director of Microsoft Research as well as the director of Google's Chinese operations.
Lee praised earlier US government technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be arranged to identify future visionaries.
Lee says American researchers have worked hard to get public support.
"Academic influencers are not taking China, but large companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited university tops to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States to step up their artificial intelligence efforts.
"I think that those who have completed a PhD should automatically grant green cards," he said.
The Chinese Government's next generation of artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Science Foundation grants funding to people working in academic institutions in the same way as the National Science Foundation and other state organisations grant money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Previously this year, the United States Department of Defence established a Joint Department of Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together industrial and academic world partners. The White House has also announced the formation of a special commission on artificial intelligence.
DARPA also announced this month an investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
In turn, NSF invests more than $100 million per year in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, the draft legislation on the establishment of a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not progressed for months.
Macedonians in a referendum amending the name of the country
In a referendum on Sunday, the Macedonians voted to change the name of the country as the "North Macedonian Republic", which would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has prevented its efforts to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
The name of the northern neighbour of Greece, a province called Macedonia, is, in practice, a regional requirement for its territory and has therefore opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the countries reached agreement on a new proposal for a name, but in the view of nationalist opponents, the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign against the vote raises doubts as to whether the voting activity will reach the required 50% limit in order to ensure that the result is legal.
The question on the ballot was: 'Do you be on the NATO and EU membership side, accepting the agreement with Greece'.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's supporters of the name change make sense that the price is worth paying so that Macedonia, which has risen from the collapse of Yugoslavia, could be a member of both the EU and NATO. .
"I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people in Macedonia, so that they could live in freedom as members of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera in Georgijevska Skopje.
Although voting is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said to respect the outcome of the vote in order to have a decisive effect.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the Central Election Board, no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, the voting activity was only 16 compared to 34 per cent of the previous 2016 parliamentary elections, in which 66 per cent of the right to vote finally gave their vote.
"I came to vote for my children and our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted the capital in Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, the Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in a referendum on the name change in Macedonia in Strumica in Macedonia. The name change opened the way for NATO and EU membership.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and set chairs for a referendum in front of the Bocotic tents in front of the Skopje Parliament.
"We are calling for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads up and not through the kitchen door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to another side, such as China and Russia as part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership brings required investments in Macedonia, with a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that a large majority will vote in favour of the change of name, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev.
He said "yes" to be "disrupting our future."
The opinion question published by the Political Research Institute in Macedonia on Monday referred to the 30%-43 % voting activity in the referendum - i.e. under the required activity.
In the second survey by the Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 per cent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they would vote in favour of the yes option.
In order to achieve a referendum, the voting activity must exceed 50% by one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious retreat to the Western government since it entered power in May of last year.
See: Manchester City Sergio Aguero beat the entire Brighton defense with his paint
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a trace of Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
At 65 minutes, Aguero made the painting he made look ridiculous easy.
At the beginning of the picture, the Argentine top player got a feed from the middle field.
He found an empty space in the field by running through three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero noticed that it was surrounded by four green shirts.
He punched over one defender and then left several others on the edge of the Brighton Penalty Area.
Then he found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English leader used his first touch within the penalty zone to give the ball back to Aguero, who passed the Brighton guard of Mathew Ryan's goal with a shot to the right corner.
City manager Pep Guardiola told journalists that "Aguero has problems with his legs."
"We talked that he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
Fortunately, he made a painting in that time."
However, Sterling had already given heavenly oranges an advantage in the campaign of selective cigaretts.
The target came in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a ball in the deep Brighton area in the situation.
He gave Leroy Sane a beautiful feed on the left side.
Sane took a few touches before he sent the ball to the back of Sterling.
The attacker of the heavenly oranges knocked the ball on the net just before the end line.
On Tuesday at 12:55 a.m., the City meets Hoffenheim's League of Champions at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a fun joker in a fight against Rockies.
Nationals is out of the fall game fight, so why strive to get a strong start-up?
However, always a competitive Scherzer hopes to take over the feeding groom at the Colorado Rockies fight on Sunday, but only if Rockies still have a dropout show. They have one win in Los Angeles Dodgers in the western series.
Rockies picked up at least a wild card 5-2 in Nationals on Friday night, but they're still targeting their first division.
"Although we don't have a stake, we can at least get up to a spook, knowing that the atmosphere of the audience and the other team here in Denver creates the most demanding competition arrangement I've encountered this year.
Why don't I want to take the challenge?"
Nationals has not yet published their beginners on Sundays, but according to the information, they are inclined to give Scherzer an opportunity under these circumstances.
Scherzer threw a training session on Thursday, playing 34 games at the start of his game and feeding on Sunday with a normal rest lease.
Washington's right-hand player has a 18-7-game/loss ratio this season. ERA's statistics are 2.53 and he has burned the beater into the nest 300 times, with a couple of 220 2/3.
Trump campaigned in Western Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation of his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, and at the same time spoke of the importance of the republican voting in the mid-term elections.
"All our achievements are in the game in November.
We're five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
This is one of the really big -- not just campaigning, but campaigning full, and so I turn around everywhere to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see this terrible, terriblely radical group of democrats, you see it happening at the moment.
They have decided to return to the Valence by whatever means, and you can see their wickedness and malice.
They will not choose who will harm or who will be scratched, so that they may get power: that will they want, power and power, but we will not give it to them.
He said that the Democrats took the task of 'resistance and prevention'.
"And it has been visible in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "hateful and evil and evil-doing and false."
When he referred to the lately influenced democratic senator Dianne Feinstein by the Senate Committee on Justice, the audience responded with loud buoys.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what?
Well, no, I'm just waiting a little -- it was really bad body tongue... the worst body tongue I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a tolerant congregation.
It does not tolerate those who say their opinion
I wasn't really surprised when the Momentum activists of my local party supported the motion of distrust against me.
At least, I am the last person in the line to be told that I'm not welcome... just because we say our opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way only because he strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure was critical of the fact that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The subjects related to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar subjects, which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
On Friday, the Labour Meeting in Nottingham East stated that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the eight years that I have served as a local Labour representative, the sizes of the Party Council on Friday have been that.
Now, many meetings do not follow that sound, and the policy of "friendly and more gentle" has long been forgotten if it ever started.
It is more clearly that different opinions are no longer tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether or not it is appropriate for the leadership of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and colleagues who had thought I shared the same political view began to expect me to complete the translation and the statements I would never have agreed to, whether it was national security or the EU internal market.
Every time I speak publicly - and that doesn't really matter what I say - the result of insults in the social media, calling for my choice to be cancelled, to reject central policy and to hear that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my own experience.
I really know I am more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me are of a political nature.
I greatly respect the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face daily sexual and racist insults and never fall astray.
The normalisation of treatment is one of the most disturbing aspects of this era's policies.
Last week, Jeremy Corby insisted that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different opinions, and every motion of censure or change in the rules of choice will only make the party more limited.
For two years, I have been urged to keep a low profile and to refrain from expressing my thoughts so that "it would go well".
But that's not why I went to politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago as a result of the failure of the Government of Thatcher's Uniform School, I have tried to promote better public services for those who need them most.
I've never hidden my political line, not even in the last elections.
No one in the district of Nottingham East has been surprised by my views or disagreements with the current management.
To those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that when the state moves towards households, businesses and public services brexit, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy to question my confidence in the leadership of the Labour Party.
But my real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters: I represent you with honor, and the threat of resignation or the promotion of a political career does not prevent me from acting in a way which I believe is in your interest.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Invincible in the Ayr block tip
Two last moments of paintings were slightly distorted by the outcome of the match, but Ayr without any doubt earned a victory in the entertaining Tennent ́s Premiership match.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team of ten who hasn't lost any match.
In the end, the excellent defense and the more successful risk taking was what supported them, and coach Peter Murchie can be satisfied for reasons.
"We've been challenged in our matches and we're still invincible, so I can be satisfied." he says.
Melrosen Robyn Christie says, "All honor to Ayr, they took risks better than we."
Ayr took the lead at 14 minutes on Grant Anderson's paint and Frazier Climo's successful conversion shot, but the yellow card of Scottish Captain Roy Hughes, which was handed over to Warriors, enabled Melrose to rise, and Jason Baggot made the painting.
Climo raised Ayr's leadership in the punishment field, and just before the half-time he made a goal and succeeded in a conversion shot raising Ayr's leadership to read 17-5.
But Melrose started another lot well on Patrick Anderson's paint, whose conversion shot Baggot succeeded in narrowing the difference to five points.
There was a long delay in the fight when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and worn out of the field. As the game continued, Ayr raised his leadership on Stafford McDowall's goal, which Climo succeeded in the conversion shot.
Captain Blair Macpherson got a yellow card, after which Melrosen Bruce Colvine made a hard-pressed goal that the conversion shot failed.
But the home team answered when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card from the ballless clipping of Clombo, and Macpherson made a paint from the sideline throw behind Ayr's maul.
Climo succeeded in the conversion shot as before, and Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and winged Gregor Henry to finish the fifth goal of the home team.

The star Ford Kieran of the Still Game series has been appointed the director of the licensed restaurant company and is thus also working in the restaurant sector.
A 56-year-old actress presents Jack Jarvis in a recommended BBC program, which he writes with his comic partner Greg Hemphill.
The twin has announced that the next ninth season is the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the public register information, he has been registered as a director of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor himself refused to comment on the information, but the Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan wanted to join Glasgow's flourishing restaurant business.
"The Sea belongs to us": the domestic state of Bolivia is trying to get back to the Pacific by legal means
Marines are patroling outside the Navy base in La Paz.
In the flags of public buildings, there is a light blue sea flag.
The Navy's bases for Titicaca to Amazon have been disturbed by the slogan: "Justicely, the sea belongs to us.
It's our duty to get it back."
In Bolivia, in the bloody 1800s, a memory of the lost coastline in Chile is still strong – as is also the desire to see the Pacific again.
The hope is highest for decades when Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of consideration.
"Bolivia has strong progress, common spirit and seizure, and of course a positive attitude in waiting for a final solution," said the Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzad.
Several Bolvians around the country hope to follow the International Court's decision on large screens, hoping that, at the end of the decades of a broken debate, Bolivia will support the position of Chile that Chile is obliged to grant Bolivia independent access to the sea.
The Bolivian carismatic president, Evo Morales, who faces the reelection of the contested struggle next year, will play a lot in the line next Monday.
"The return to the Pacific is very close," he convinced at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the Court is unlikely to decide in the interests of Bolivia, and even if it decides, the situation would not change very much.
The United Nations institution of Dutch concern is not empowered to release Chile's administrative areas, and the ICJ has indicated that it does not determine the final outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ decision is given only six months after the last statements were made suggests that the case "not complex", says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
In addition, the last four years have slowed down rather than promoted Bolivia's goals.
"The current Bolivian government has removed the issue of maritime connection," said Zárate.
Morales' challenged rhetoric has repressed the rest of the Chilean goodwill, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue discussions at some point, but it will be very difficult to organise negotiations after that.
There has been no other embassy in either country since 1962.
The former President and the Bolivian representative, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, do not agree with the view that the Court's decision was exceptionally rapid.
On Monday, he gave Bolivia the opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile and to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits," he said.
Mr Calzad also argues that Morales, one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, would have used the maritime issue as a political support.
"Bolivia will never give up his right of connection to the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to understand that it is time for us to move forward from the past."
North Korea announced that nuclear disarmament will not occur unless it can be trusted in the United States
North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington, said North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He reminded the United States of keeping the promises made by the Heads of State at the Singapore Summit.
Rin's position came just before the United States Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo is restarting the death penalty diplomacy with nuclear weapons, just three months after the United States met Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it is a "whole dream" to believe that the continued sanctions and the United States' resistance to the Korean declaration of the end of the war would come on the knees of North Korea.
Before Pjongjang has taken significant measures to promote the use of weapons, Washington is alert to the adoption of the Declaration.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a new summit.
But the view that Pjongjang would be going to give up the arms arenaal, which the state is likely to see as the only real way of guaranteeing its own security, has had great doubts.
Pompeo is going to visit Pjongjang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump summit.
The fashion shows in Paris showcases the most recent model sizes, which will soon be also in your nearest street
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you don't have to keep looking.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne at their SS19 model show revealed a range of special super-great heads that would shrink the style circuits of Paris fashion weekly.
Very unpractical heads took over Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their amazing creatures to fashion displays as well.
Valentino's most eye-catching creation was a beige hat with a wide feather, covering the heads of the models almost completely.
Other overwhelming garments included a watermelon decorated with ornamental stones, a magical hat and even ananas — but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks – just right before Halloween.
Several colourful masks had swept lips, and they more like Hannibal Lecter than high-mode.
One creature equipped with a snorkel and a mask resembled more of the dive equipment, and another resembled the melted ice cream.
And if you want to take a stand for a big fashion, you're lucky.
The followers of fashion foretell that huge lusts are about to appear in the street picture.
Excessively sized hats follow closely "La Bomba", a half-metre-lined hat that has been seen from all Rihah to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult reputation of an unpractical hat that was seen in the social media also vivid another large creation into the fashion samples — a pole-made pancake, which is almost as large as the model that bears it.
In the fashion weeks of Paris, the smoked orange armored raft bag with white leather gloves was the most eye-catching creation of Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 model.
The famous Stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I am seeing large hats and beach bags in the street picture next summer – the designers have made such a great impression that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large clothing."
John Edward: Language skills are key skills for a world citizen
The results of private schools in Scotland have traditionally been good, and this success has continued in 2018 as a result of good results. Success has been enhanced by individual and community success in sports, art, music and other community projects.
Over 30,000 schools located across Scotland, represented by the Scottish private school council SCIS, seek to provide high-quality services to their students and their parents.
Private schools strive to prepare their students for their chosen careers, continuing and higher education and world citizenship.
As an operator of the education sector, who can design and implement tailored learning content, we have noticed the status of languages as a recommended and desired subject in continuing educational institutions.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to a person in his own language, the message goes to his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to create relationships with the people of other countries.
With regard to the latest results of this year, we find that the languages are at the top of the lists with regard to the percentage of transit between private schools.
68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages reached the highest grade A.
The material was collected from 74 SCIS schools. Based on the material, students who received the best grade A, 72 per cent studied mandarin, 72 per cent studied German, 69 per cent studied French and 63 per cent studied Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support the study of foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently freely selected substances, but they are kept at the same level as natural substances (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the private school study programme and elsewhere.
Based on the survey made by the UK Employment Office in 2014, 17 per cent of the situations in which the employer had difficulty finding a suitable employee for the job were explained by lack of language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore even more necessary in order to promote the career development of young people.
The more possible tasks require language skills, the more important these skills become in the global world.
If a person has studied another language, he will have a privilege of this lifelong skills in the future, regardless of what career he has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner to place a language-skilled person automatically ahead of the competition.
According to the 2013 YouGov survey, 75% of over 4,000 adult isobritanian adults are unable to talk in a foreign language, and French was the only language with a two-digit figure of 15%.
It is therefore important for the children of today to be involved in teaching languages.
In particular, the knowledge of the languages of developing countries gives children a better opportunity to find a meaningful career.
In Scotland, schools differ in what languages they teach.
Several schools focus on traditional languages, while some specifically teach languages that are likely to be important for Isobritannians in 2020, such as mandarin and Japanese.
Despite your child’s interest in private schools, several language options are always taught by specialised teachers.
Private schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed for success, whatever the future brings.
In this time, we cannot deny that in the international business environment languages will continue to be very important for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, current languages should be seen as "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this freedom of choice, diversity and a high level of education for young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.
John Edward is Director of SCIS of the Scottish Private Schools Council
LeBron's doing a debyte Sunday in San Diego
LeBron James's first appearance in the Los Angeles Lakers line is soon over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego before the season starts.
But how many minutes he really plays remains to be seen.
"It will be more than one, and less than 48," said Walton Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to be playing in default minutes.
James, who followed the exercises, was asked earlier this week about his plans for the six games to be played by the Lakers before.
"At this stage, I don't need any more pre-games to prepare," he said.
Time for Trump's Western Virginia campaign, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching the election campaigns today in Wheeling in Western Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five elections scheduled for next week, including compassionate objects such as Tennee and Mississippi.
In anticipation of his election to fill the seat of the Supreme Court, Trump is trying to increase support for the forthcoming mid-elections, since the Republicans are at risk of losing the majority in the November elections in Congress.
By what time is Trump's Western Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
Trump's Western Virginian Wheeling event begins at 19:00 a.m. on the east coast on Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can view Trump's Western Virginia campaign event online as a live trick via YouTube by clicking below.
Trump will take a position on hearing Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court candidate of this week, who became a violent accusation of sexual harassment, which has delayed the Senate's confirmation vote in the week after the FBI's investigation.
But the primary objective of the campaign series is to support the success of the Republican candidates in the tight November elections.
As a result, President Trump's campaign was commented on the purpose of the five events of the next week "to raise the voluntary and profitable Republicans to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives", said Reuters.
"Management of the Congress is so essential for his purpose that the President is ready to travel to as many states as possible during the busy campaign season," said Reuters, a permanent representative of Trump's campaign.
Today's venue is Wesbanco Arena Wheeling, and there can be supporters even from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh" according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump's second visit in the current month in Western Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump supports the senator Patrick Morrisey of the Republican Republic of Western Virginia, who has been left behind in the assessments.
"There is no good sign for Morrisey that the president is trying to raise his support for opinions," said scientist Simon Haeder from the University of Western Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team will show a fight to keep hope up before Sunday single games
After three unilateral sessions, the four games of Saturday afternoon were exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
Although the strength of success itself is a completely invented phenomenon in sport, the players believe in it, and more and more in such tournaments.
Where is this power of success, according to them, at the moment?
"They had a six-point lead position, which fell down to four, so we take this success power as a tip," said Jordan Spieth walking away at the end of the day.
Europe has, of course, a privilege: four points above and 12 points to be played.
The Americans, as Spieth said, are experiencing that they have a little wind in sailing and a lot of encouragement, such as Spieth and Justin Thomas's condition, which enabled them to play together all day and get three points out of four.
Spieth has been overwhelming from the road to the green, and it has been an example.
The winning party's handsome throat sounds increased when his round went on, when he succeeded in a critical pipe to compensate for the match to just four, when he and Thomas were two points behind after two holes.
The pound with which they won the 15th match was followed by a similar cry that gave the idea that he believes that the United States team has not yet lost.
"You have to focus really well and only take care of your own fight," Spieth said.
That's the only thing that these players have left now.
18 holes to make the impression.
The only players who have received more scores than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are the Ryder Cup's contested legends of Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's special, but sweet twos have won four of four in error.
"Moliwood" was the only two who did no bogia on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogit on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That round, and the way in which they give and get energy from this gorgeous audience, confirms that they are the predecessors of Sunday. And when the sun drops in Le Golf National, another more popular player to ensure Europe's potential victory could not be like Fleetwood and Molinari.
I'd rather both at the same time in different holes.
However, talks about Europe's success are premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Alex Noren, a coupled Sergio Garcia, who was the hero of the fourth game of the morning.
One bog and two double bogs in the first nine holes digged the Spanish and Swedish so deep that they were not near to survive.
But on Sunday, no one will help you out of the pit.
Four-ball and four-game games are fascinating to follow closely from the point of view of a couple’s cooperation: what kind of advice they give or leave, and how strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team until now and has taken a significant lead before the last day, but this four-year game has shown that the United States team has a desire to fight, although it has been suspected, especially in the United States.
Europe takes 10-6 leadership before the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe is in good leadership before the last day of Ryder Cup after they took the lead in four balls and four games on Saturday 10-6 from the United States.
The great twins Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the victory with two wins from Tiger Woods, and got the score balance up to four points today in Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who worked hard to maintain a victory two years ago in Hazeltine, was weak in control of the United States team in the morning's four-ball game, leading the game to 3-1.
The United States was a tougher opponent in four games, winning two matches, but they were unable to reduce the leadership.
Jim Fury's half needed eight points from the 12th double game on Sunday to keep a win.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner who has won four points in a row. He and Molinari, also called together "Molliwood", were after a sensational weekend in Ryder Cup's history a second twin who has won four points in the first four games.
After first breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball, they finished the overwhelmingly enthusiastic Woods and the American beginner Bryson Dechambeau 5-4.
Woods, who hardly survived through two matches on Saturday, was occasionally very brilliant, but has lost 19 of his 29 matches in four balls and four games, and even seven consecutive.
Justin Rose rested the 4 balls in the morning, but returned to the 4 game with Henrik Stenson, but lost 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked first and third.
Europe did not get everything as it wanted in this fresh and pleasant day from Paris to the south.
The threefold prize winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high goal for the Americans on Saturday at two points.
They won a sissy 2-1 victory from the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball, and later 4-3 win from Poulter and Rory McIlroy in a four-game game after the first two holes have been destroyed.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history, the team has risen from four points back to levels at the start of the double games, although Furyki's side also has enough equals to keep a win.
However, after two days, the second best may be that the counter-attack on Sunday is too much requested.
North Korea "nowhere in any way" will take away itself from weapons without confidence
On Saturday, the North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs told the United Nations that continuing sanctions only increased distrust in the United States, and under these circumstances there is no possibility that North Korea should give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
At the UN General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea has taken "significant good-will measures" over the past year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile experiments, decommissioning the site of nuclear experiments and promising that North Korea will not increase the number of nuclear weapons or technology.
"We have not seen a similar gesture from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of the preservation of national security, so under such circumstances it is not possible to remove ourselves from weapons unilaterally."
Although Mr Ri reiterated the well-known current of complaints that Washington did not accept a gradual abandonment of nuclear weapons, which would reward North Korea for every intermediate subject, his statement was important in the sense that one-sided disarmament was not completely excluded, as Pjongjang has done before.
Ri referred to the joint opinion given by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit of the US President and the Head of North Korea in Singapore on 12.6. Kim convinced "The removal of the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons" and Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought to formally end the Korean war between 1950 and 1953, but the United States has insisted that Pjongjang should first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the facilitation of the strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States demands "from nuclear weapons first," and have increased the pressure by means of sanctions to achieve its goal by force – even against "declaration of peace"," Ri said.
"The idea that the sanctions would bring us on our knees is an indifference.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions only deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention the plans to organise the next Kim-Trump summit, but Trump himself stressed the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings with the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months and added: "If a party calling for weapons was South Korea and not the United States, the situation would not have progressed towards such a deadlock."
However, Rin's sound was significantly different last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the direction of missiles towards the United States continents was inevitable after the "bad president" Trump called Kim a "missile man" equipped with suicide intentions.
Still last year Trump threatened "to completely destroy" North Korea. This year, however, Trump praised Kim for giving up this courage, but nevertheless stressed that there is still a lot of work left and sanctions should remain until North Korea abandons nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday Trump mentioned that he has no time limit: "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia suggested that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongjang for the progress already made.
However, the United States Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the strengthening of the Security Council's sanctions should continue as strong and without fail until we testify to a complete, final and strengthened abandonment of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously intensified sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with the aim of suppressing the financing channels for the production of ballistic and nuclear missiles in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met at the UN General Assembly in North Korea, and announced that he would visit Pjongjang again next month for the preparation of the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times in this year, but the last visit did not go smoothly.
When he left Pjongjang, he described progress. However, North Korea condemned Pompeo's "gangster requirements" only a few hours later.
North Korea committed itself to closing the drilling point and nuclear plant at a meeting with Secretary-General Moon earlier this month in the event that the United States would take "equivalent measures".
According to Pompeo, Kim means "like measures" security guarantees that Trump committed to meeting Singapore, and the transition towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students conduct an adequate rest course
This year, all basic students at Harvard University participate in a course aimed at increasing student rest. The course is a counter-attack to a thriving macho culture at the University, where students press a long night with the caffeine power.
According to the researcher, students from the world's best university are often quite ignorant in basic matters related to their own well-being.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Medical Sciences at Harvard University, who is working on sleep studies at Brigham and Women's Hospital, believes that the course is the first of his species in the United States.
Czeisler got an idea for a course after reading about the effect of a sleep deficiency on learning.
After the lecture, a young woman came to me, saying, 'Why am I hearing about it only now, in my last year of study?'
No one had ever told him about the need for a dream, which I think was surprising," he told in the interview with Telegraph.
For the first time this year's course will guide students about how the right unitation supports academic and sporting achievements and improves general well-being.
Professor of Medical Sciences at Harvard University and Deputy Director of Health Services at the University Paul Barreira says that the university had completed the course after they had heard how students suffered from severe sleep shortages during the week of study.
An hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, students will present a picture of the dorm room where the student can click on coffee shops, curtains, sports equipment and books, thus obtaining information on the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep deficiency on sports performances and the importance of regular evening activities.
The second section tells participants how long-term sleep deficiency can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to consider their daily routines.
"We know that this does not have an immediate impact on student behaviour.
However, we believe that they have the right to know these issues in the same way as they have the right to know the health effects of smoking," Professor Czeisler adds.
According to Professor Czeisler, the whole night’s long-lasting study trips are still the subject of pride, and current technology and the increasing pressure of students made a growing problem of sleep shortages.
"To get a sufficient and high quality sleep should be a 'secret weapon' of students against stress, fatigue and anxiety, and even against increased weight, because sleep deficiency causes a state that resembles starvation in the brain, which is why people are constantly hungry," says the professor.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student in chemical and physical psychology, helped Professor Czeisler to plan a course after he had attended one of his courses during his first year in Harvard last year.
He tells me the course opened his eyes and gave the impulse to all campus students organize a comprehensive course.
He hopes that all student students will be able to carry out a similar course of study before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students should also remind them of the sleeping time in addition to morning awakening and urge them to keep in mind the side effects of the "black light" of electronic displays and LED lighting for daily rhythms, which may make it difficult to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengan shot took victory from Gerrard players
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers again experienced a new loss day when Dolly Menga's shot through the broken defense brought Livingston a 1–0 victory.
Ibrox's players were picking up their first win then in February 4-1 game that went against St. Johnstone. However, Gary Holt's team took the win this time, and Gerrard was only experiencing his second loss during his 18 game manager's career. Rangers left eight points away from the current leader of Hearts.
Menga launched the ball to the goal seven minutes before the half-time, and the battle rate of the Rangers fell after that, the situation was no longer straightened.
As a result of the game, the Rangers fell to the sixth place. Livingston has climbed to the third place, and the top of the painting is only Hibernia.
The Rangers may also face other problems, because Calum Spence was injured during the game when the object thrown from the visitor look at the head, and the wound has had to be handled.
Gerrard made eight exchanges for the composition of which the team had beaten Ayr and advanced to the semifinals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt continued with the same Livi 11 composition, which led the team to take a point from Hearts last week. The same strategy resulted again when the well-built composition succeeded in disciplineing the opponent almost every time.
Although Rangers managed to dominate the possession of the ball, Livingston was better to use the situation for its own benefit.
Livingston had the opportunity to reach the goal for two minutes when the first feed of Menga gave Scott Pittman a free road to the goal of Allan McGregor. However, Pittman failed to take advantage of the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed his free shot to Craig Halkett, but another defender Alan Lithgow only succeeded in swinging broadly into the back.
On the other hand, the Rangers took control of the game, but in the last third of the game, there was no more certainty in the air.
Alfredo Morelos called for punishment when he and Steven Lawless had encountered each other for fifteen minutes, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian requests.
The Rangers managed to try only two goals in the first half of the year. However, the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly rejected the trouble of Lassana Coubaly's bag and Ovie Ejaria's impotent shot.
Livingston's goal at 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but the situation was not just because of the team's hard work.
The Rangers still couldn't do anything to Jacobs' long feeding tactics.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher fed Scott Robinson, who coldly brought the ball to Menga for easy painting.
At the time of change Gerrard decided to change Coulibany and put Ryan Kent on the field. The change affected the game almost immediately when Kent created a suitable hole for Morelos. However, the attack broke Kelly's impact on the rapid defense.
Livingston made visitors play their own game again when Lithgow and Halkett continued long inputs.
The Holt team had the opportunity to increase its leadership in the last moments of the game. However, McGregor’s fine defense prevented Jacobs’ intentions before Lithgow reached his position.
Glenn Middleton, a member of the Rangers exchange, also called for a penalty shot after having joined Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanakka: Geigermeter inventor
Next page of our "Sunday Morning" alm: 30 September 1882. Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, a future physicist, was born in Germany this day 136 years ago.
Geiger developed the method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, and then led to the development of a device known as a geigermeter.
The method became one of the pillars of science, and the meter also the central concept of pop culture. For example, the film "Coronado watches" published in 1950, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans present quite impressive scientists from cattle shepherds:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger meter, it's used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put the ears on your ears, you can actually hear the radiation impact on the minerals."
Evans: "Look, now it's really ratting!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, an invention that bears his name is still alive.
New cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system to “see” malicious cells
New cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system to “see” malicious cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malicious cells as part of treatment
In the process, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory
After treatment, the cells injected back into the body are able to ‘see’ several eating typical proteins
The co-coagulant has produced promising results in patients with different cancers.
For example, cancer cells in a patient with ovarian cancer disappeared during 18 months after he had been treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify malicious cells.
In the process, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory so that they are able to ‘see’ typical HER2 proteins for many eaters. In the end, converted cells are injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the United States National Cancer Institute in Bethesda describes the method: "On the basis of our results, this is a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "directs the growth of several types of cancer," explains Professor Berzofsky. "These include breast cancer and ovarians, lungs and thickened intestines."
A similar approach — taking resistant cells from the patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells — has also produced results in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West fell into the critics' teeth after praised Trumpi Saturday Night Live a campaign hat in his head.
The show didn't go as planned
Kanye West got his neck buoys in the Saturday Night Live entertainment program after praised President Donald Trumpi in a blatant style and by advocating that he would be president in the 2020 elections.
After presenting his third song "Ghost Town" on Trump's Make America Great Again campaign, West attacked the Democrats and reiterated his support for President Trump.
"When I talk to a white man, they ask me how I can support Trumpi because he's a racist.
If racism were a problem, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he says.
This evening's mission began with a sketch in which Matt Damon was irrelevant to Brett Kavanaugh's hearing in the Senate Committee on Justice, which relates to the claims made by Christine Blasey Ford on the sexual harassment of Kavanaugh.
West's fasting was not presented in the direct broadcast, but comic Chris Rock downloaded it into the social media.
I don't know if Rock's intention is to spot West with his mail.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had been treated like a hat in his head.
"I was bothered behind the scenes.
They told me I shouldn't go on stage with this hat in my head.
I've been tempted!
Then they will say that I am in margin," West says in the interview with Washington Examiner.
West continues: "Do you want to see what it means to be marginal?" and says he's dressed with Superman, because "When you can't tell me what I'm doing. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
According to Variety, West's comments shrinked the audience's buoys at least twice, and the show's performers seemed embarrassed. One of the presents described the situation to the magazine as follows: "The whole studio became completely quiet."
West was selected in a short warning program to replace Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused confusion in many viewers by presenting the song "I love it" as a Perrier bottle.
West receives support from the leader of the Conservative TPUSA organisation, Candace Turner, who praised this courage on Twitter: "Thank you for your trouble."
However, Karen Hunter said that the West "was just its own, which is quite wonderful".
"I can, however, decide to be a person supported (by buying this music or clothing mark or by supporting this "art"), which I believe is supporting and spreading the ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free person.
The same applies to us," he added.
The rapper announced before the evening that he had appeared on Twitter that he had changed his name as a "person formerly known as Kanye West".
West is not the first to change his name. The musician follows this Diddy, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg was also known under the name Snoop Lion, and of course we remember the even lost music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and later an artist who was previously known as Prince.

The star Kit Harington of the power game is attacking toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is known for his sword-screaming heroian in the violent HBO fantasy series of Jon Snow'na.
However, Harrington has attacked the machosankar stereotype: according to a 31-year-old actor, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned hard.
In the interview with the Sunday Times, Harrington suspects that "something has gone wrong" and questiones the ways in use to deal with toxic masculinity during the time of the #MeToo phenomenon.
Recently, also Harrington, who was married with Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that she had a strong desire to intervene.
"The question of where we have gone wrong with masculinity will raise strong feelings in me at the moment," he says.
"What has been taught men about their growth in the years that have led to the problems now detectable?"
Harrington believes that television and very masculine characters are partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity.
He continues: "What is the innerborn and what has been learned?
What is taught on TV and streets that make young boys feel that they need to be certain to be men?
I think this is one of the major issues of our time – how can we change this?
Because young men have something really wrong."
In the interview, he also admits that he would not participate in the production of the pre- or follow-up parts of the Kingdom game after the series ends next summer, because he has, according to his own words, "beat enough of battlefields and horses".
In November, Harrington will be seen in a new version of Sam Shepard's True West play, which tells about the film producer and his robber brother.
The actor recently revealed that acquaintance with his future Rose wife was the best thing that the Kingdom Game has offered him.
"I met my wife at this show, so in some way it gave me my future family and life from then onwards," she says.
Rose Leslie plays Ygritte, the target of Jon Snow's love by Harrington in the Emmy Awarded Fantasy Series.
The couple was married in June 2018 at Leslie family premises in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: The number of new infections in China has increased by 14%
China has reported an increase in the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-infected citizens by 14 per cent.
According to the health authorities, the virus affects the lives of more than 820 000 people in the country.
Approximately 40,000 new cases have been reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
A clear majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which means a change in previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through blood transfusions contaminated in some parts of China.
However, according to the Chinese health authorities at the Yunnan Conference, HIV infection has been reduced by almost zero.
However, a year later, the number of HIV-infected and AIDS-infected people in China has increased by 100,000 cases.
HIV infection through sex is an acute issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT humans has been reported to be widespread.
Studies have estimated that, due to the conservative values of the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many diseases are due to insufficient protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised to guarantee the general availability of HIV medicines as part of the response to the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the worker has lost information from the Republican scientist and accuses him of the spread of "dangerous lies" and "secretary theories"
On Saturday, Maxine Waters, a member of the United States Chamber of Representatives, contested the claims that his employees would have published personal information on three Republican scientists on the Wikipedia website.
The representative of the Democratic Party from Los Angeles assured that there were "right-right" comments and websites.
"Lögns, lies and more disgraceful lies," says Waters Twitter in his opinion.
Among the information published, it is reported that there were home addresses and telephone numbers of Senator Lindsey Graham, representing South Carolina, and Senator Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, representing Utahi State.
On Thursday, an unknown person published the information from the United States Congress during the hearing of the Senate Committee, which concerned charges against the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, for sexual abuse.
The leak occurred a little after three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Punds and RedState, report that, according to the Hillin message, the messages were published from the IP address attached to the Waters office and by a person belonging to the Waters staff.
"This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and it is an absolute lie," Water continued.
"My worker, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised due to these fraudulent and false accusations, is in no way responsible for the release of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and absolutely false."
Waters’ statement was quickly criticised on the Internet, and the critics also included the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"The way he denies this is very hostile," wrote Fleischer.
"It seems that his character does not fit a member of the Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he has no reason to be hostile.
There's no reason to threaten.
There's no reason to question the prosecutor's motives.
You should behave slowly and calmly in the situation."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during the hearing on Thursday.
The Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who competes for Waters in the Congress Mid-elections, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
"Unbelievable if this is true," he doubted.
In its opinion, Mr Waters announced that he had contacted 'the appropriate authorities and law enforcement bodies in view of these fraudulent accusations.
"We will ensure that the factors are revealed," he continued, "and that they will be brought to legal responsibility for all devastating and dangerous actions against some or all members of my staff."
Johnny English hits again – a subordinate Rowan Atkinson agent parodie
There is already a established tradition of looking for brexit references from any film that is on the way to Britain. However, this does not seem to be suitable for Johnny English's agent parodie and the series of activities, which started in 2003 with Johnny English's run and resurrected with the 2011 follow-up "Johnny English – Newborn".
Can the language of the nation’s satiiri in cheeks become the new national export success of Britain?
Yes or so, a muzzle-eyed, rubberized and incompetent Johnny English has already earned his permission to recur. Even his name tells me above all that it is a comic creation that is aimed at film markets outside the English world.
Of course, this is the silly secret agent who desperately seeks to breathe a melting glamour around him, but appears to be a mixture of inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean and the unfortunate one-note musician at the 2012 opening concert in London.
The bottom of Hahmo is the cosmopolite and mystical world man who left behind the chaos of the side, which Atkinson originally presented in the forgotten Barclaycard TV advertising.
The last show has a moment.
In particular, I liked the scene where Johnny English arrives on a helicopter dressed in a medium - time harness, and the roottor's platforms collapse with his helmets.
The gifts of Atkinson's physical comedia are emerging, but humor itself seems subtle and unusually unnecessary, especially because ‘serious’ movie brands such as 007 and Hazardous Mission today offer humor as part of the core content of the film.
The humor seems to be directed to children, and Johnny English's insane treatment doesn't seem as clever and shiny to me as Mr. Bean's secret roles comic at Atkinson's.
The repeated starting point for each year is that Britain is worse in trouble.
The cyberhakker has infiltrated the British top secret spy network and reveals the identity of all British agents operating on the ground as a shock to the agent in service, as illustrated by Kevin Eldon’s regrettable small role.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister in the main and surface, who is already ready for political disobedience: Emma Thompson is doing everything he can in the skins of Teresa May parodiahah, but the manuscript does not just provide him enough space.
When the intelligence advisers inform him that all the spies on the ground have been revealed, someone who has already moved away from active service must be invited to the emergency.
This is, of course, a drunken Johnny English in his own personality. He spends his retirement days as a teacher of the fine school, but at the same time gives informal lessons in the noble art of spying. The topic shrinks some smart jokes; English holds classes of School of Rock in intelligence.
English will be pronounced at the emergency meeting in Whitehall, where he will meet again with his infinitely patient battle partner Bough, who will continue to play Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine coach, whose role Vicki Pepperdine does not seem to have his rights.
So the catastrophic Batman and Robin have returned to his majesty's secret service to meet Olga Kurylenko's fateful supercriminal Ophelia Bhuletovan.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is being manipulated by a charismatic IT billionaire, and Jason Volta, acting by Jake Lacy, claims to be able to solve British computer problems.
The English and Bough's odyses will be turned into a farse immediately: a double dressed as a waitress will light the fire of a fine French restaurant and cause chaos in seeking secretly to Volta's luxury hunt. The attempt to explore Volta's house through virtual glasses will end up in a clean anarchy in the real world.
Even the last obstacles of the authors are squeezing at the end of the event, but despite all powerlessness and charm, the film still feels a little bit of a kind of thing done to the children.
The film can be considered moderate.
When I watch Johnny English movies, I've already come to the same point: why is the British film industry unable to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would make justice for his talent?
The British Labour Party denies plans for a four-day working week at five-day pay
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour is thinking about a radical plan that the British would work four days a week, but the pay would be paid for five days.
The party is reported to require the transfer of savings generated by the revolution of artificial intelligence from business leaders to workers in the form of an extra day off.
According to the plan, workers could enjoy the three-day weekends at the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea ‘suitable’ would be the party's economic programme and its plans to cost policy for workers.
The Centre for Trade Unions supports the transition to a four-day working week as a means for workers to benefit from the changing economic situation.
The High Level Labour Party's source tells Sunday Times: "The revision of the line has been informed before the change in year.
The change will not take place in a moment, but a four-day working week is an objective that fits the party's approach to economic balance for workers, as well as the party's general industrial strategy."
The Labour Party is not the first person to support the idea: the British Green Party committed itself to supporting the transition to a four-day working week during its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, the objective does not receive undivided support in the Labour lines.
The Labour Party reporter states: "The four-day working week is not the line of the party, and the party is not considering moving into such a way."
The shadow government minister John McDonnell used the working conference last week to present his vision of economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to inherit power back from "visitless dictators" and from "companies of general interest".
According to the shadow government's plans, the current shareholders of water companies would not be allowed to return their share in their entirety, as Labour-led government could implement "reductions" on the basis of detected abuses.
He also confirmed the plans to place employees in corporate management and to create inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10% of private sector companies' share capital to the management of employees.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are discussing in the 60-minute program whether the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could change their mind.
The investigation of charges against Brett Kavanaugh by the FBI judge has delayed at least a week the final vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh as Judge of the Supreme Court, and the delay also raises the question whether the outcome of the investigation could undermine the support of some Republicanists for the appointment of Kavanaugh.
In the 60 minutes program section to be sent on Sunday, the programme correspondent Scott Pelley asked the senators of the Republican Party John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether it could be possible for the FBI to find out what they could think of.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I told you to hear... I said I've been talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened when the accusations came out, and I asked him ‘Did you do that?’
He was determined, determined, unambiguous."
On the other hand, Graham's voice looks like a stone was beaten.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it's a bomb safe," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following thing: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added Christine Blasey to Ford.
"No one of the people whom he appointed could confirm it.
It's about 36 years old.
I don't see what could change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
The World Citizen Festival, held in New York on Saturday, is a music event that is as impressive as its mission: to remove poverty from the world.
The seventh World Citizen Festival now attracts tens of thousands of people to the New York Central Park lawns to listen to performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make the event known for the real goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation for the Global Powerty Project, an international advisory group aimed at eliminating poverty by increasing the number of people active in eradicating poverty.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (if it is not willing to pay for the VIP ticket), the public must perform various tasks or "works", such as voluntary work, send an e-mail to the political finalist, or call, or perform any other work that will spread awareness of the project's objectives.
But how has Global Citizen succeeded now that the goal is over 12 years?
Does the idea of rewarding on a free concert ticket have a real way of convincing people, or is it just one ‘clicism’ among others — an idea that the world can change by signing a web address or sending a TV?
Global Citizen reports that he has booked more than 19 million "work" for different purposes since 2011.
According to it, these acts have encouraged political decision-makers to announce commitments and principles of over $37 billion, which have been used in a way that affects the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and declarations based on which more than $10 billion has already been used or collected.
The group estimates that the resources achieved have already affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The main commitments include, for example, The Power of Nutrition, a group of investors and operators in the UK, which has committed itself to "to assist the development of children in full potential". The group committed itself to delivering $35 million to Rwanda in order to terminate the underfeeding in the country, after the activists had sent them 4,700 twists as a result of the Global Citizen campaign.
"Thanks to the British government, donors, governments of different countries and just people like you, we can transfer social injustice and malnutrition to the history of history," said Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman at a concert held in London in 2018.
According to the group, the British Government was also urged to take action to improve the nutrition of mothers and children with more than 5,000 actions. The Government has published funding for the Power is Nutrition project, which is aimed at combating under-food, which reaches 5 million mothers and children.
One of the questions on the shop's website is, "Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
The global citizen's answer: "The science will be long and difficult and many damp stones are in front of us.
However, we will succeed, as the major civil rights struggles and the apartheid movements before us, because together we are stronger."
Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman run a New York concert this year, and its star card includes artists like Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe.
According to the U.S. Ministry of Interior, the country can complicate energy exports by using the fleet as a "obstruction"
According to the US Minister for the Interior Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner, Washington can "if necessary" use its fleet to prevent the spread of Russian energy on the world market, including neighbours.
Zinke claims that Russia’s activities in Syria — the invitation of the legal government — are an excuse for the recognition of the new energy markets in the region.
"I believe that the cause of [Russia]'s presence in the Middle East is the transmission of energy, just as in Eastern Europe, the southern half of Europe," Zinken says.
According to the official, there are ways and means available to prevent this.
"The United States has the ability to keep ship paths open by means of its fleet and, if necessary, by ensuring that the energy they provide does not reach the world market," he says.
Zinke spoke to the public of the event organised by the Energy Consumers' Association, a non-profit group that profiles itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued by comparing Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran by pointing out that this is one and the same thing.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less speculation, and replacement of fuel by another," he says, and describes Russia as a "one trick circus number" whose economy is based on fossil fuels.
These opinions are due to the situation in which Trump's administration has sought to improve the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and to replace significantly cheaper Russian liquefied natural gas.
In order to enhance this, Trump's administration, including President Trump, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to President Trump, is bound by Berlin's return to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasised the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the transfer capacity of 110 billion cubic metres of the existing pipeline, as a purely economic project.
Kreml claims that there are purely economic reasons behind Washington's opposition and considers it to be an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose its journalist," says the Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak after meeting the US Minister of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American attitude has led to a response in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The country's leading industrial roof organisation, the German Central Industrial Union, has urged the United States to stay away from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I am very problematic about the involvement of the third state in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Director of the German Industrial Central Association, recently after the meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, intends to think carefully about the nomination for presidential elections in 2020
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts, announced that he would "think carefully" to become a presidential candidate after the mid-elections.
Warren confirmed that he was considering candidateship at an open polling event in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to move to Washington and repair our defective administration, and this also means a woman at the headquarters of the kingdom," he said in The Hill magazine.
"After the sixth day of November, I'm going to think carefully about becoming a presidential candidate."
Warren evaluates President Donald Trumpi during the occasion by saying "he's taking the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he says.
Warren has acted straightforward in criticizing Trumpi and the candidate of this Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course, we need a FBI investigation before we vote."
However, according to the opinion question published on Thursday, the majority of Warren’s voters do not support this condition by 2020.
According to Suffolki University Policy Research Institute and Boston Globe's research, 58 % of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts do not support the appointment of a senator.
32 % supported the nomination.
More than one of the respondents supported the appointment of former Governor Deval Patrick on a 38 % stake, while 48 % opposed the idea.
Other nominative candidates for the 2020 elections raised in the debates include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
According to the Associated Press news office, Biden has said that he will formally decide on his nomination by January.
Sarah Palin refers to her son's wardrooms in Donald Trump's election
Sarah Palin's son, Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recruiting the armed forces in September.
Track Pal was arrested against Monday night and was charged with family violence
"What my own son will have to go through when he returns home, I can be very similar to other families who have to face the consequences of PTSD and the injuries that our soldiers will carry back home," he told the audience in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Donald Trump's election meeting.
Palin called the arrest a ‘virtuous horse in the living room’ and said his son, like other veterans of war, "will return home a little changed, they will return hardened, they will return wondering if they will be respected what he and his companions have done in the army and in the air forces for this land".
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska. According to the Wasilla police officer Dan Bennett, he was charged with abuse of family violence and women, as well as with family violence and the treatment of a weapon.
18 states and Columbia's federal district support the new action against asylum practice
Eighteen states and Columbia’s federal district are applying for a change to the new line of entry into force in the United States that no asylum is granted to gang violence or family violence.
18 representatives of the state and the federal district have left the right-wing friends letter on Friday in Washington. The letter supports asylum seekers who violate the line says NBC News.
The full name of the solicitor has not been published in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union raised in August against the federal line.
He tells his partner "and his sons of a violent gang" abused him, and the U.S. authorities denied him asylum on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
The public prosecutor, supported by Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of US asylum seekers come from, as countries where gang and family violence has spread the problem at all levels of society.
The new United States asylum policy annulled the 2014 decision of the Board of Appeal on asylum applications that undocumented immigrants were able to apply for asylum on the basis of domestic violence.
On Friday, the public prosecutor Karl Racine of the Columbia District commented that the new line "misses attention for decades of federal, federal and international law".
The Federal Law requires that all applications for asylum be resolved on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application and that such an obstacle violates this principle is stated in the letter of Friends of the Right.
In a letter, the prosecutors also claim that the practice of preventing asylum seekers' access will harm the US economy, as firers are likely to become entrepreneurs and "produce the necessary additional labour".
In June, the Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to suspend the granting of asylum to victims of family and gang violence.
"The place of refuge is intended for persons who flee from their home country because of persecution or fear caused by the race, religion, nationality or a certain class of society" Sessions announced in its opinion of 11 June on the new asylum practice.
Asylum was never intended to solve all the problems — even serious problems — that people face every day around the world.
Desperate survivors’ rescue operations continue — the number of deaths found at Return has already doubled
The situation of the survivors is becoming more serious.
"The location is very tense," says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming down her fever baby at the evacuation centre in the ruined city of Pala.
"The ambulances bring new bodies a minute.
The clean water is scarce."
The inhabitants return to their destroyed homes, pick up their watered goods and try to save what is still to be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured and the hospitals damaged by a 7.5 magnitude are full.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who suffers from spinal and shoulder fractures, rest outside the Fire Army Hospital, where patients are treated for continuous, severe afterbearings.
His eyes were filled with tears when he repeated how an angry earthquake shakes the fifth floor of the hotel room that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was pushed between the ruins of the wall, I think." Harris says Associated Press, and tells me that he and his family were wedding guests in the city.
"I heard my wife shouting help and then became quiet.
I don't know what happened to her or my child.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of "provision" by "propaganda announcements"
The U.S. Chinese ambassador accuses Beijing of using the American newspaper as a means of propaganda, a week after the Chinese newspaper was published in the U.S. newspaper, a four-page advertising that praises the mutual advantages of the trade agreement between the U.S. and China.
Last Wednesday, President Donald Trump referred to the paid annex of the China Daily in the newspaper Des Moines Register, which is the largest newspaper in the Iowa state, after accusing China of being involved in Congress elections on 6 November. China has challenged the arguments.
Trumpi's accusations of Beijing's attempts to intervene in the US elections mean, according to the US authorities speaking to Reuters, a new step in Washington's expanding campaign to press China.
Although it is normal for the foreign government to spread notifications to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in the ever-increasing trade war, where both parties in turn impose customs duties on the counterparty's export products.
According to Chinese and American experts, at the beginning of the trade war, the Chinese revenge tariffs had been directed to states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador and long-term Governor of the State of Iowa, says that Beijing has caused damage to the U.S. labour, farmers and businesses. Iowa is a major exporter of agricultural products to China.
China "is now accelerating its provocations further by publishing propaganda announcements in our own free press," Branstad wrote in his opinion paper published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday.
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government benefits from the traditional American free word and press by placing a paid announcement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad writes.
"There are different opinions on the streets of Beijing, instead, only limited, and real, different opinions that Chinese citizens cannot see at all about the alarming development of their economy. This is because the media is firmly in the backdrop of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
Branstad continues by telling us that "one of the largest newspapers in China avoided the offer to publish" the article he wrote, but does not specify which newspaper it is.
Kavanaugh-fiasko banishes female voters from Republicans, analytics warn
According to analysts, the fact that many of the republican leaders stand behind and defend him by the Supreme Court's magistrate, Brett Kavanaugh, can cause a response, particularly in the forthcoming mid-term elections on women's voters.
The feelings surrounding the case have taken a great deal of time, and most Republicans have already indicated that they want to move forward in the vote.
"These things cannot be cancelled," says Professor Grant Reeher Syracuse from the Maxwell Institute at the University of The Hill on Saturday.
Reeher does not believe Senator Jeff Flake (Republicans, Arizona) that the last moment's offer of FBI investigation will relax angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday and they won't forget tomorrow or November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and reporter of the National Reform Group MoveOn, according to the newspaper published in the capital on Friday.
On Friday morning, mentors sang "in the coming of November" in showing their opinion in the Senate corridors when the ruling republicans decided to move on to Kavanaugh's appointment, which happened despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reports.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be appraisable," says Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst in the interview on the news site.
"The people say that the enthusiasm has already been high, and it is true.
But it could be even bigger, especially for women's uncertain voters and younger voters in the neighbourhood, 18 to 29 years old, who do not often vote because they don't like the president."
Analysts anticipate possible counter-reaction if the Republicans progress with confirmation already before Ford's testimony against the candidate of the Supreme Court, where he presented his claim of sexual harassment.
"This is becoming a messenger for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, NBC News at the beginning of last week.
"It is not just a matter of the Committee's vote or final vote or whether Kavanaugh is being questioned; it is a question of how the Republicans have acted and how they have dealt with Fordia," said Guy Cecil, Head of the Priorities Group for Democrats in the USA, on the news channel.
However, the Americans seem somewhat divided in whether they should believe the testimony of Ford or Kavanaugh when a small majority tends to the latter.
According to the new assessment made by YouGov, 41% of respondents believe that Ford's testimony is absolutely or likely, while 35% say they believe that they are absolutely or likely to believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 % say that they think that Kavanaugh is likely or absolutely lying in his testimony, whereas only 30 % said the same about Ford.
After Flake's move on, the FBI investigates Ford and at least one other, Deborah Ramirez's accusations, The Guardian reports.
Ford, in front of the Judicial Committee, falsically testified to Kavanaugh when he was 17 years old when he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the candidate of the Supreme Court revealed to him his relative bodies at the student festival while they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web inventor plans to start a new Internet counter-attack on Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of World Wide Web, has launched a startup company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inruptt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open source code for Solid.
Solid allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to any information.
In the Fast Company interview Berners-Lee jokes Inrupt's purpose is to "manage the world".
"It must be done now," he said to his startup company, referring to.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal data storage" or POD.
It may contain contact information lists, memory lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available on one browser at the same time.
In the personal data storage, it is unique that you are completely connected to the user who has access to which type of data.
The company calls it "for personal entry into force through data".
According to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is to give resources, processes and demanding skills to bring Solid to everyone's reach.
The company currently includes a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, some contracted developers working with the project and a community consisting of voluntary co-operators.
Technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications with tools available on the Inrupt website. All of this is available from this week onwards.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team are not discussing "with Facebook and Google whether people should be offered a complete change where all their business models are turned to their heads in one night".
"We don't ask for their consent."
In his article on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote Inruptt "the task of providing commercial energy and ecosystem for the unity and quality of a new network built for Solid".
In 1994 Berners-Lee established the Internet by the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Berners-Lee also retains its position as the founder and leader of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and Open Data Institutes after the launch of Inrupt.
"I am extremely optimistic in view of the next era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the city remembers the first World War’s heroial priest
The city celebrates the only priest who has been rewarded by the Victoria Cross medal of the Church of England as a soldier after 100 years of events.
The medal of courage was awarded to Colonel Bernard Vann on 29 September 1918 following the attacks on the villages of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, Vann died four days later, a sniper was created without ever knowing the highest honour of the British army.
Two of his grandchildren were revealing a memorial stone in Rushden, Northamptonshire, last Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says that the event is "impressively symbolic"; a memorial was revealed just 100 years after his rewarded grandfather's urotea.
According to the London Gazette, 29.9.1918 Colonel Vann led his patalion over the Canal de Saint-Quent "in a very dense fog and under the fire of heavy field guns and machine guns."
Later, he fell into the front line and "howing the greatest courage" led to the advancement of the forces before being shot alone on the field boots. In the battle followed Vann cast his own hands out three gunpad soldiers.
Colonel Vann died of a German sniper was created on 4 October 1918 – only a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's act was "something that I could never achieve, something that raises respect."
Michael Vann He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, laid down a bar after the parade of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says it's a great honor to be part of the Paradise, and he added: "The great crowd of people is remembering the glory of the true hero."
Friends of the free fight waited all night for the Bellator 206 tournament – the TV channel showed Pipsa Possu
Imagine the situation where you've been watching all night to watch the expected Bellator 206 tournament and not to present the whole event.
The event in San Jose had 13 matches, including six main series matches, and the show was intended to be a direct broadcast in the UK Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the ring, the program was changed to a great shock for Pipsa Possuu's viewers.
Some of the viewers were not really happy with their watch all night because of the fight.
One friend of the free fight opened up on Twitter, depicting the replacement of the game as a "a kind of sick joke" for children.
"According to the law, this content was not appropriate to be presented at 6:00 a.m., so they had to switch it to the children's program" explained Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior director for marketing and communication, the exchange of the program."
"Pipsa Possu, yes."
Scott Coker, director of Bellator, said that schedules will be worked to allow the British audience to monitor the events in the future.
"I'm thinking about a retransmission that will probably make the program work," Coker said.
"However, it is six o'clock in the morning there, and we will not get the program presented before Sunday our time, which is in turn Monday their time.
We're working on it.
You can believe that when the program changed in their heads, messages began to go in the direction and another, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix the mistake because we thought it was a technical problem.
However, that was not the case, it was a legislative matter.
I can promise you that the next time this will not happen.
We're limiting the number of matches to five instead of six, as usual. We tried to offer our fans more and we tried too much.
This is a shameful situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
The swim jumper and the Olympic athlete Tom Daley says he feels lower than anyone else because of his sexuality, but this motivates him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete tells me he didn't notice until he got to high school that "all aren't the same as me."
Daley, who talked about gay rights in the Desert Island Discs program of Radio 4 by Lauren Laverne, says he talked about gay rights in order to give hope to others.
He also tells us how it was no longer so important to win the Olympics after having a child.
Kristy Young, a regular runner of a long-term radio program, has taken several months off because of a disease.
As a guest in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt like he was younger than everyone else because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and work".
He says, "To this day, these feelings, feeling less and different have been reality, and they have given me the power and energy that I need to succeed."
He says he wanted to show himself to be ‘something’ so that he would not be disappointed to everyone since his sexuality finally became apparent.
The two-fold Olympic Pronsimitalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist, and he is present at the International Games this year calling for the criminalisation of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came out because he feels lucky to live openly without sanctions, and he wanted to give ‘hope’ to other people.
The three-fold world champion tells his love for a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – "as a surprise."
Daley married himself to a 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but says that age difference has never been a problem.
"If you experience so many things when you're so young" – he took part in his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – "it's hard to find another one of the same ages who would have experienced similar matches," says Daley.
The couple got a boy in June – Robert Ray Black-Daley – which has changed Daley's "total perspective".
"If you had asked me last year, my life would have been around winning the gold medal," he says.
"You know, there are more things than the golden Olympic medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
His son was named Daley's father, who died in 2011 at only 40 years of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father never accepted that he would die, and one of the latest things he asked Daley about the 2012 Olympic tickets. He wanted to sit in the front.
"I couldn't say to him that he will no longer be there to be in front of him," Daley says.
"I loved him with his hand when his breath stopped. Only when the breath had actually stopped and he was dead, I finally understood that he was not inviolable," he says.
Next year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the pross.
"I knew this is something I've dreamed of for my whole life – jumping in front of the audience at the Olympics. There is no better feeling," Daley says.
This was also an inspiration for his first song selection – Heather Small’s song "Proud" – which raised feelings already when he was preparing for the Olympics, and still gets his skin on chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs will be sent to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Half-run for Mickelson exchange bench Saturday at Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will break the record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup round, but he must be deceived to avoid the record cycle as a unhappy show in history.
Mickelson, who plays every two years in a record 12th event, moved to the exchange bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the fourball and foursome season to be played on Saturday.
Usually, the five-fold major tournament winner, who was at the centre of the attention, has now spent half a day as cheerleader and on the other side of the field trying to catch his beat.
The 48-year-old Mickelson, who has not even been considered one of the most accurate drivers at the top of his career, is not an ideal choice for a tight Le Golf National field where a long-lasting bear is punished for inaccurate hits.
If there is not enough resistance to Mickelson in the field itself, the ninth game on Sunday will be against the British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who plays together with the entrant Tommy Fleetwood, whose goal is to insulate all four win tubes this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind when coming to 12 double games, get a flying departure, the Michelson game can prove to be extremely important.
Furyk has expressed confidence in his player, but what else could you say in the situation?
"He fully understands the role in which he played today. He killed me in the back, ruthist and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He's got a lot of self-confidence.
He belongs to the best players and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't imagine he'd play two games.
I imagined something else, but that's how this went, and that's what we're about.
He wants to be in that field as much as anyone else."
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the more numerous Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It can also mean the end of a man’s Ryder Cup career, which, though, was never comparable to his personal performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halfs, but according to Fury, his presence brings something indefinite to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, smart, keeps people at the expense of jokes and he's a funny guy whose company everyone likes," he explains.
"Your players also probably had fun with him this week. It's fun to watch.
He brings as much more to the team as only his stake in the game."
Captain Thomas Bjorn of the European team knows how long a leadership position can be lost quickly
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that Ryder Cup’s large leadership position before the last day’s double games can become a rude journey.
The Danish player made his debyte in 1997 in Valderrama, where Seve Ballesteros, headed by Seve Ballesteros, had a five-point leadership position in relation to the Americans, but who survived the winner with the lime lines just and just with its nose and won with the narrowest possible margin141⁄2–131⁄2.
"That reminds us of how we led steadily in Valderrama, we led steadily in Brookline, where we lost, but we won in Valderrama, though little," said Bjorn after looking at the team 5-3 wins of 2018 both Friday and yesterday, moving to the 10-6 leadership in the Le Golf National field.
History will show both to me and to all the other members of the team that this is not yet over.
Tomorrow we'll shoot with a big cabbage.
We're going to the field and we're doing everything right.
The game isn't over until the numbers are on the table.
We have a goal, we are trying to win that award, and we are only aiming at it.
As I have always said, I focus on these 12 players who play on our side. However, we are aware of what is the opposite: the best players in the world."
Delighted to see how his team's players have done out of the difficult field, Bjorn adds: "I will never lick until I drop into such things.
Tomorrow is completely different.
Tomorrow, individual achievements will be the priority, and different things will be discussed.
It's great to be on the field with the partner when everything goes well, but when the field is alone, the player's capacity is tested according to the bottom.
This is a message that must be sent to players – tomorrow everyone will be able to achieve the best performance.
Now we have to give up the partner, who is also allowed to go [to the field alone] and do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, the other-party captain Jim Furyk will require better performance of its players as individuals than they could as partners. The exception is Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points out of four.
Furyk, for his part, has experienced the last day’s full turns in both directions. He was involved in the team that won in Brookline before becoming a loser when the European team won "Medinah miracle".
"I remember every evil word," he answered the question about how Captain Ben Crenshaw of the team of 1999 extended the lines of his team to the trials of the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start just like happened in Brookline, or as happened in Medina.
When it moves in one direction, it accumulates plenty of pressure on the middle games.
We have set up our composition accordingly and we will put the boys on the field in the way we want, as you know, we will do miracles tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned to try to lead the defence fight and he meets Rory McIlroy in the main game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are in order to meet their European counterparts.
"I put the group's friends in this order, because I think it's carrying through the whole tournament," Bjorn commented on his dual games choices.
Germany's new warship is delaying again
The latest phrat of the German fleet should have been introduced in 2014. The ship is intended to replace the old cold-war equipment, but it will be introduced early next year due to defective systems and explosions, reports local media.
According to the military reporter who spoke to Die Zeit, ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the first launch of the new Baden-Württemberg phregati class, has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the fleet in 2014, but the worrying post-delivery problems have persecuted an ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg ships ordered by the fleet in 2007 are intended to replace the declining Bremen Fregates.
According to the available data, they are equipped with effective guns, missile systems for the fight against aircraft and surface vessels and divergent technology, such as radar reflectivity and technology to reduce the detection of infrared and acoustic signals.
The main features of the ship also include a longer maintenance interval – new phregates should be able to operate on the sea for up to two years without visiting the harbour.
However, continuing delays mean that the high-tech warships – which are supposed to improve Germany’s influence in the overseas regions – are already obsolete at the time they enter service, says Die Zeit.
The badly happy F125-Fregati ended up in the titles last year when the German fleet officially refused to launch the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet returns the ship after it has been delivered.
There is little knowledge about the reasons for the return, but there are essential "software and equipment defects" in the German media, which make warships unfit for combat tasks.
Software deficiencies are particularly important because the crew size of the Baden-Württemberg category is about 120, which is only half of the crew of the Bremen class.
In addition, it has been shown that the vessel is overweight, reducing its performance and limiting fleet opportunities to subsequent updates.
The Rhineland-Palatinate, with a capacity of 7,000 tonnes, is believed to be twice the weight of the equivalent class ships used in the second World War of Germany.
In addition to the defective equipment, the whole project's price gap is also creating a problem.
The price is estimated to rise to EUR 3.1 billion at the original price of EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the introduction of new fregates have emerged as the German maritime power has recently been warned of declining.
Mr Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, noted earlier this year that the fleet's ships are "reaching down".
According to the Authority, the problem has grown over time because old vessels have been removed, but no new ships have been replaced.
He complained that no Baden-Württemberg Fregate could be introduced to the fleet.
Environment Organisation listens to the encrypted life of flasks
A new study in the area above Scotland will seek to determine how the bats exploit the land in hunting food.
It is hoped that the new study will bring new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will guide future protection measures.
The study carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland monitors the dwarf and dwarf racks, as well as the replacement rods and water wings in the Inverewe Garden area of the plantological garden in Wester Ross.
In the study, special storage equipment will be placed on key areas in the region to monitor the operation of flea.
The organisation's employees and volunteers also carry out mobile measurements using portable observation devices.
The frequency of votes and the species concerned are ensured by the analysis of experts.
On the basis of the results, a habitat map and a report will be established in which the behaviour of the bats can be presented in a region-wide picture.
Rob Dewar, the organisation's conservation advisor, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to flea, and how different species use them.
The information will help to design habitat areas, such as the creation of flocks and the management of forest areas, taking account of flasks and associated species.
Scotland and the whole UK flea populations have declined significantly over the past 100 years.
Building and landbuilding work threatens the resting places and habitats of flasks.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as fly papers and certain chemicals used in construction materials, as well as pet contest attacks.
In fact, the flasks aren't blind.
However, due to nightly hunting methods, their ears are more beneficial in catching than in the eyes.
The bats use advanced echoing technology to detect insects and obstacles on their airline.
The National Trust for Scotland is a rural environmental protection organization that maintains more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares across the country – and they take the flea seriously.
It has ten experts who regularly carry out surveys, checks on resting sites and, in some cases, also animal rescue activities.
The organisation has even established the first and sole protection area of Scotland for the protection of flea in the territory of Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of flea in Scotland are present.
According to farm manager David Thompson, the area is ideal for flea.
"Threave fits very well for flea," he says.
"We have old buildings and trees and a good living environment.
Our work here and in other areas of the organization will help us to understand better what flea needs to succeed."
He emphasises the importance of revising the buildings in the case of flea before rehabilitating, as the destruction of one flea resting place can accidentally cause up to 400 female flea and boy deaths and destroy a whole local population.
The flasks are protected animals and the killing, disruption or destruction of their flasks is prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the Flea Protection Organization, encourages the public to participate in the protection work.
He says, "We still have a lot to learn about our flea, and yet we don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo denies the charges of rape while lawyers prepare the case against the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has stamped up the rape charges against him as "vale news" and says people want to "release themselves" by using his name.
The lawyers of Ronaldo have taken action with a view to publishing the German Der Spiegel magazine.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of rape of an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Lasvegas hotel in 2009.
He is claimed to have paid the victim $375,000 for the silence, Der Spiegel reports on Friday.
Ronaldo appeared to his 142 million followers in the Instagram direct broadcast only hours after the claims were made. The 33-year-old footballer strongly rejected the accusations and described them as "vale news".
"No, no, no, no.
What they have said today, lighting news," the five-fold winner of Ballon d'Or said to the camera.
"They just want to advertise themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name. It's part of this profession.
I am a happy man and everything's fine," the player continued smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing for the challenge of Der Spiegel in court for claims called "unreasonable reporting of doubts under privacy protection" according to the Reuters News Office.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the player demands compensation for "spiritual suffering according to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged case was reported to have happened in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino hotel suite in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorgan are reported to have met at the night club and moved to the player's room where he is alleged to have raped it anally, according to the papers delivered to the Nevadan Clark County Regional Court.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo had fallen on his knees after the alleged event and said that he was a 99% good guy, but that one percent was disappointed.
According to documents, Ronaldo has confirmed a couple having sex, but it was mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims to have gone to the police station and taken photographs of her injuries in the hospital, but later ended up in a conciliation solution, because she was "drowned by the possibility of revenge" and worried "to be subjected to public humiliation".
The 34-year-old now says he is applying for the revocation of the conciliation procedure because he is still traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was close to the agreement to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged overhaul, and moved to the Italian power team Juvento with a $100 million agreement.
Brexit: Great Britain would come to regret the end of car manufacturing forever
Great Britain would "repent forever" if it would lose its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, Minister of Industry Greg Clark said.
He added that he considered it "sorgful" for the announcement by the United Kingdom Unit of Tokyo to temporarily suspend production in his factory near Derby, Burnaston, if the UK departs from the EU without agreement.
"We need a deal," Clark says.
The Japanese car manufacturer says that the effect of delays in frontiers will be visible in the event of job losses if the Brexit ends without a contract.
The factory in Burnaston – which manufactures the models of Toyota Auris and Avensis – produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other European Union.
"My view is that if the UK suddenly leaves the EU at the end of March, we will make production interrupts," says Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of the Tokyo Burnaston Unit.
Other car manufacturers in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears of decommissioning from the European Union in how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW has announced that it will close its mini manufacturing plant for a month when the brexit is implemented.
The main concern concerns the risks associated with the supply chain in the implementation of unsuitable brexit, as reported by the car manufacturers.
The Tokyo production line is run by the timely JOT principle, where parts arrive at the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers from the UK and the EU, and cars are made from order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it may cause disturbances at the border, which, according to the sector, could lead to delays and difficulties.
According to Toyota, keeping a 24-hour warehouse at Derbyshire factory is impossible and production is expected to be interrupted.
Clark says that Theresa May's EU relations plan is "precisely calibrated to avoid these inspections at the border".
"We need a deal. We want the best possible agreement that is not just a success in the current situation, but an opportunity that we must take advantage of," he says in the BBC Radio 4 Today program.
"Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers' statements show that we must definitely be able to continue the very well-functioning series of supply chains so far."
Toyota cannot tell how long production should be stopped, but warns that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a trade union journalist at the factory, says the concern among the growing members: "My test says that the jobs lost will never return.
The government reporter says: "We need to present an accurate and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House announces
Donald Trump's challenging meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein can be "due to the need to move a week to the Supreme Court candidate around Brett Kavanaugh, due to the bribery, the White House announced on Sunday.
Mr Rosenstein supervises the work of the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who in turn investigates Russia's involvement in the elections, the links of Trump's assistants to Russia and the possible action of the President to prevent justice.
In Washington, there has been rumor for months that Trump intends to separate the Deputy Minister of Justice, which would jeopardise Mueller's investigation's impartiality.
Previously this month, the New York Times reported to Rosenstein that he had discussed the possibility of recording secretly discussions with Trump, as well as the possibility of resigning the President on the basis of the 25th amendment to the US Constitution.
Rosenstein has denied the report.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting was to tell us that Rosenstein was dismissed from his office.
However, President Trump was visiting the United Nations at that time, so the day of the meeting was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he would "do not prefer" to separate Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because its time came together with the hearing of the Senate Committee of Justice, where Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of him, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI's weekly investigation of claims against Kavanaugh, which continued to delay the vote in the Senate plenary.
Trumpi's press manager Sarah Sanders performed at Fox News Sunday program.
When he asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, Sanders said, "The date hasn't been set for this. It could be next week, this week, it can be postponed another week because of everything else, which is currently under way in the Supreme Court.
But I always want to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists might disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since 10 September.
Chris Wallace asked me why.
Sanders says that the reason for the lack of press conferences is because of other reasons than disobedience to TV journalists' "demand for attention", but he said, "I do not deny the fact that they are looking for attention."
However, Sanders showed that the direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President holds more queries than any president before him," he says, and adds further evidence without citing: "We have checked those numbers."
"The press conferences will continue to be organised," said Sanders, "but it is infinitely better if the media have the opportunity to put questions directly to the President of the United States than to discuss with me.
We are often trying to do this and you have seen us have done this many times in the last few weeks, and this will replace the press release so that you can speak directly with the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open events or press conferences with valuable people visiting.
Presenting alone at a press conference is rare.
This week, in New York, the President may have shown the reason for this in an unobstructed and occasionally strange way to journalists who met.
The Minister for Health wrote a letter to employees of the Scottish Public Health System (NHS Scotland) in relation to fears of Brexit
The Minister for Health has written a letter to the workers of the Scottish health system from EU countries to express their gratitude and hope for their stay in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter when the UK's resignation from the EU remains for less than six months.
The Scottish Government has already been prepared to cover the costs of applications for "established status" for EU citizens working on specialised public services.
In his letter Freeman writes as follows: During the summer, divorce negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU have continued towards future decisions in the autumn.
The United Kingdom Government has also intensified its preparations for a possible inappropriate difference.
I know that all of you are uncertain times.
That is why I would like to repeat now how much we appreciate every employee's contribution to citizenship.
Colleges across the EU and outside the EU bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health work and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie for emergency surgery due to head injury
The supporter of the Tennessee State Tigers team, Christion Abercrombie, has been in emergency surgery since the team had lost 31–27 Vanderbilt Commodeurs on Saturday, reports the journalist Mike Organ of Tennessea.
Tennessee State chief coach Rod Reed told the journalists that the injury occurred just before the half-time.
"He came to the side line and simply just slipped into it," Reed says.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the sideline before they put him on the pairs and took him on the side for a more detailed assessment.
Tennessee State's journalist told Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has received surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "the type/width of the insult is not known at this stage" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the insult occurred.
Abercrombie is a second-year student at the Tennessee State University and plays the first part of his team after his transfer from Illinois.
He had five backpacks on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 backpacks this season.
From foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when buying properties in the UK
From foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they purchase real estate in the UK. Additional money will be used in accordance with the new plans of the Conservative Party to help homeless people.
The aim of the amendment is to neutralise Corby's success in attracting young voters
The increase in stamp taxes concerns those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to collect up to GBP 120 million a year – to help homeless people
Theresa May will inform foreign buyers today of the higher rate of stamp taxes to be borne by foreign buyers when buying real estate in Britain.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters. Corby has made promises about cheaper apartments and paid attention to the taxation of well-being.
The increase in stamp taxes is directed at people and businesses who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom, which will lead extra money to government action in order to facilitate the loss of homelessness.
An additional fee – which is added to the current stamp tax two years ago, in addition to the increase in second dwellings and investment dwellings – may be up to 3%.
The Minister of Finance expects the increase to produce up to GBP 120 million annually.
It is estimated that 13% of London's new buildings are purchased by non-permanent residents in the UK, which will increase prices and make the potential of first-class buyers on the property market more difficult.
Many wealthy areas in the UK, especially its capital, have become ‘ghost cities’ because many foreign property owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new line will only come weeks after Boris Johnson introduced a reduction in the stamp tax as a means of facilitating the purchase of first homes for young people.
He blamed large building companies for keeping the prices of real estate high by buying land and not building it, and urged Prime Minister May to abandon the quotas of cheap housing in order to correct the "shameful situation" in Britain.
Corby has published a series of proposals for reforming the housing market, including restrictions on rents and the cessation of "confidential weddings".
He would also like to give delegations more authority in matters related to the construction of new dwellings.
Prime Minister May says: "I said last year that I was going to own the British dream of my Prime Minister, that every generation of life should be better than its predecessor.
This means repairing our broken housing markets.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right that people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies abroad, can buy homes as easily as busy British residents.
Too many people have become a far too long dream of owning a home, and the shame of homelessness remains a fact."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish country team"
Sunderland's leader Jack Ross says his "peripheral goal" is to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotch is enthusiastic about the challenge of raising the northern corner of the country's team back to its feet. The team is currently third in the UK's second division.
Ross moved to the "light stadium" this summer after he had redirected St Mirren back to the Scottish election team last season.
"As a player, I wanted to play in my country's team.
I got to team two, and it was there," Ross says on the BBC's Scotland's Sportsound broadcast.
"When I was a child, I often watched Scottish games with my father at Hampden, and it's something that has always pulled me back.
Such an opportunity will only be met if I succeed as the manager of the company."
Ross's predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former director of Alloa Athletic says that he was not concerned about getting to the heads of his nicknamed predecessors in a nicknamed company, and he has previously rejected the offers made by Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
"At this moment, with my own success, can I return this company's choice.
On the basis of the structure and ability of the company, it is undoubtedly part of the selection team," he says.
"Your access isn't easy, but I probably think I'm successful only if I get the trusted team back to the selection team."
Ross has only served as manager for three years: first as Deputy Director of Dumbarton and then for 15 months in the Heats coaching group.
Afterwards, he helped Alloa rise out of the three-series games and raised St Mirren from the fall condition to champions during the following season.
Ross says he feels better now than ever during his player's career in Clyden, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical teams.
"I was probably in a real crossroads with my career," he remembers the time when he moved to the head of Alloa.
"I really believed I was a better manager than a player.
It sounds strange because I played well, I earned a little good, and I got to enjoy some relatively big successes.
But playing can be hard.
The player has to deal with a variety of things every week.
I'm still going through the same things, such as stress and work pressure, but running the team feels like it's just a job.
I always wanted to lead the team, and now I do it for my job. I feel better in my own body than ever in my adult life."
The entire interview is scheduled for the Sportsound broadcast on Sunday 30.9., Radio Scotland frequency at 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time to enjoy the rice is on Saturday at 17:30, research shows
The summer’s heat wave has fired the British troubled pubs, but at the same time more pressure on the restaurant chains.
According to statistics, sales of pub and bar chains increased by 2.7% in July, but the yields of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
The figures of Peter Martin's Business Consulting Company CGA said: "Continuous sunny weather and a longer participation in the World Football Championships in England meant that July was made up of a 28% higher sales of pubs like June, while the month was worse for restaurants.
The decrease in the sales of restaurants in summer 1.8 per cent only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars focused on the drink side were most successful. Their like-for-like sales increased more than the decline in the sales of restaurants.
The pubs focusing on the food side also suffer from the cleavage, but less dramatically than the tour operators of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to get out of their minds.
Sales of pubs and bars run by companies increased by 6.6% over a month, and food sales decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman says about the RSM company providing free time and hotel-restaurant consulting services: "The results continue the trend that has continued since the end of April.
The weather and major social or sports events are still the main factors affecting the sale of non-home meals.
It is not surprising that the struggle for food chains continues, although the decrease in annual sales of 4.8% is sparkling, especially now that the sector is currently fighting with cost-saving agents.
The long hot summer could not have come to a worse sow for food-foddered operators, and only time would show whether the film’s lower temperatures will bring the breathing relaxation needed in the sector.
In July, the total total growth in sales of pubs and restaurants, including new open restaurants, was 2.7%, reflecting the slowdown in the creation of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker is the next barometer for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sales, which collects and analyzes results from a 47-year group with a total turnover of more than GBP 9 billion, which is considered to be a reliable meter in the sector.
Five percent of children hide social media accounts from their parents
A fifth of the children – some of whom are up to 11 years old – are secret from social media accounts from their parents and teachers, research reports
Research involving 20,000 higher education students revealed the growing phenomenon of ‘Instagram fake accounts’
The news raised concern that accounts can share sexual content
20% of students said they were holding a ‘final account’ shown to parents
A fifth of the children – some of them are even 11 years old – create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
The research involving 20,000 students at the University revealed the rapidly growing ‘Instagram fake accounts’, referring to the Instagram website for sharing pictures.
The news has raised fears that accounts can publish sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they would keep cleaned ‘head account’ to show parents while using other, private accounts.
One mother found messages written by a teenager who hoped that he would be raped after having encountered his 13-year-old daughter's secret site.
In the study carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the HMC, 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 had two distinct profiles, and half of respondents admitted to keeping secret accounts.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan says: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to set up a network where parents and teachers cannot find them."
From Eilidh Doyle "Speak of Sports" to the Government of Scottish Sports
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the government of Scottish athletes as a non-member of the board and is taking part in the annual General Assembly of the administrative body.
Doyle is the most rewarded general athlete in Scotland. The president of the government, Ian Beattie, describes the appointment as a great opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from the extensive international experience that the athlete has gained over the last decade.
"Eildh is highly respected by athletes in Scotland, Britain and internationally. I am sure that Scottish athletes would benefit enormously from his appointment to the government," says Beattie.
Doyle says, "I look forward to my role as the voice of athletes and I hope I can be useful and help to guide Scottish sports in the right direction."
Four Olympic cults won by American athletes who won 200 meters and 400 meters in 1996 at the Olympics in Atlanta, and now acted as a regular commentator of BBC, lost their ability to walk as a result of a transient brain circulation disorder.
He wrote on Twitter, "A month ago, I had a stroke."
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, it's only time to show me if I'm going to get better and what's going on.
This has been a tiresome job, but I have recovered completely, learned to walk again and now I'm already exercising greed!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
Mothers' Equivalent Advertisement Shares Opinions Online
The breast pumping company's mothers are breast-feeding by advertising similar to milk cows has shared opinions on the Internet.
Elvie, a producer of consumer technology, has placed a product on the market called "the world's first silent and wearable breast pump". Its marketing is speeded up by an advertising that suits the style of music videos, which describes the mothers who are breastfeeding by the new pump.
Four mothers of real life dance in a navy filled with the haines, among other things, with the following song saying: "Yes, I'll sneak myself, but I can't see him" and "if you didn't happen to notice, they're not utares but they're tits."
"Pump it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, pump my lead."
However, the advertisement published on the company's Facebook page led to a discussion online.
A video of 77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments has brought about conflicting reactions in viewers. Many say that it will ruin the daily ‘scakes’ of the dairy industry.
"The use of cows in the advertising of this product was a very bad decision.
They must become pregnant and be born so they can produce milk. However, their babies will be stolen from them soon after birth," says a commentary.

Another viewer commented: "It is understandably traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why could they not be used to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their baby?"
The third commentator added: "Perfective reality-required advertising."
I also got defenders: one woman admits that the advertisement was "what" she thought.
"I think this is a great idea.
If I were still breast-feeding, I'd get that kind of thing.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
This is a genius product," says one of the comments.
Another viewer commented: "This is a fun advertising that is directed to mothers who pump (often at work or in the bathrooms) and ‘feeling themselves cows’.
The purpose of this advertising is not to praise or condemn the milk industry."
At the end of the ad, women in the video reveal that they have danced unnoticed pumps in their breasts.
The concept of the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women using the breast pump feel like cows.
Instead, the Elvie pump is completely silent, there are no wires and hoses and it is unwisely suited inside the breastfeeding vests, allowing women to move, keep the baby and even go outside during pumping.
Ana Balar, a partner and artistic director of Mother advertising office, commented: "The Elvie pump is a transformative product that deserves a courageous and provocative entry on the market.
By breast-feeding mothers and milk cows we wanted to bring all the challenges associated with the use of the breast pump into light, we brought out the feeling of incredible freedom brought by the new pump in a entertaining and simultaneous way."
The Elvie pump has ended up in the headlines before.
During the London fashion week, the mother of two children appeared at the catwalk designer Marta Jakubowski's costume using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent at the border of Texas in all silence
In spite of the fact that the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, this is due to the difficulties in the placement of children in the family as a result of the harsh rhetoric and policy introduced by the Trump administration.
Most family members have traditionally been made up of undocumented immigrants, and registration as family members may jeopardise their own residence in the country.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that possible alternate families and other adults in the economy should give their fingerprints and that this information should be shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, the High-Level Immigration and Customs Authority, last week at the Congress, witnessed the arrest of dozens of people who had applied for subfamily for minor immigrants.
Later, the Agency confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no previous criminal record.
"Approximately 80% of people who are members of the family or their households are illegal in the country, and most of them are criminal foreigners.
So we're going to keep looking for these people," Albence says.
In seeking to deal with children's cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules whereby, in some cases, the matter must be dealt with by the Court of Justice rather than by a 60-day period prior to the arrest, the employees of the Centre report.
Many people prefer to appear through a video conference rather than personally before the court on the issues of immigrants.
Those who are not considered eligible for aid are expelled quickly.
According to the reports published in recent months by the reception centres and the system, the time spent by children in prison affects whether children are beginning to suffer from anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent discharges or escape attempts.
According to lawyers, concerns are particularly highlighted in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs of child despair can be ignored due to the large size of the facility.
They add that moving children to tent cities without giving them enough time to prepare for them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause a trauma, and that many children are already suffering from trauma.
Syria commands the United States, France and Turkey to leave immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, speaking at the UN General Assembly, also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been in war for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign troops were illegally in the country, using excuses from the fight against terrorism, and that 'they will be acting with them'.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed that "the anti-terrorism war is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died in 2011 and then, and where millions of people have been forced to escape from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue the "holy battle until the whole of Syria has been cleansed" from both terrorist organisations and "illegal foreign forces".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers located in Syria, where they are mainly training and conducting the Arab forces against Kurds and President Bashar al-Assad.
France has invested in fighting to break down over 1,000 soldiers.
On the question of the refugee, Moualem said that the circumstances were good for the return and accused "some Western countries" of the "proliferation of irrational fears" which encourage refugees to stay away from the country.
"We have called on the international community and assistance organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politiciating a thing that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be granted to Syria before the end of the war has been agreed between Assad and the opposition by means of a political agreement.
According to the UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer area at the last base of the rebellious in Idlib has created an opportunity for political discussions.
The Agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented the widespread attack of the Syrian forces supported by Russia on the three million people.
However, Moualem has stressed that the agreement has "clear time limits" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including the fighters of the al-Nusra border associated with Al-Qaida, "which will be destroyed".
UN ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon be able to convene the first meetings of the new government and opposition committee for the creation of a draft post-war Syrian Constitution and for the upgrading of the road to elections.
Mr Moualem set the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that its work should be limited to "revising the provisions of the current Constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will be selected for another season
In accordance with this logic, President Trump would win the elections of 2020 unless, as many of the Liberals are likely to hope, the formalization and scandal of his presidential term would be decided in advance.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic presidential decision ever!"
No signs of fatigue have been observed in viewers so far.
Since 2014, the best viewing time figures have doubled by more than 1.05 million CNN and almost tripled by 1,6 million MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers for the best viewing time compared to 1.7 million one year ago, and the MSNBC Rachel Maddow Show has accessed cable TV: peak numbers with 3.5 million viewers on the most important news nights.
"This is a riot that attracts people, because it is something we don't understand," says the main producer of the Designated Survivor program of ABC Neal Baer from the minister who rises as the president of the attack after the collapse of the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, who has experienced a comic writer and book Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club author, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told me he was going to vote for Trumpi.
Scovell asked why.
The driver said, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell says.
The chaos has a entertainment value.
Of course, by way of other TV programmes, news from Washington can determine how Roe vs. Wade is going to deal with whether the members of the immigrant families can come to each other and how the world economy can.
Insufficiency is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond the obligation of a aware citizen to look at a six-hour panel of experts, who argues about the use of Bob Woodward's source information for Fear, the consequences of the ungorgeous descriptions of the US$ 15,000 struts-leather (Washington Post) and Stormy Daniels President Trumpi's anatomy.
For example, I can never look at Super Mario again the same way as before.
"What he's doing feels like a real TV program, because it's partly about giving the public something every night," says Wheelhouse Entertainment, director of the Panttilainahaus-series, author of the changing people and daily turns of the Brent Montgomery Trump show (NFL dispute, Kim Jong-un's praise).
You can't miss any episode, or you'll fall off the car.
When I reached Mr. Fleissi this week, there was a lovely sunny day at his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he couldn't go out because he looked at MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not get rid of the programme in which Brett Kavanaugh was in front of the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs and the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we made all those crazy programs and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Outside, money flows to a rigorous mid-election campaign
It is not surprising that the 17th constituency of Pennsylvania has faced a real cash flow, because due to the reorganisation of the Congressional constituencies, two candidates already elected will have to fight for one place.
This recently re-limited Pittsburg electoral district is a battle challenge for Democrats Conor Lamb, who took place in the special elections last spring from another electoral district.
Lamb competes with another elected candidate, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's 12th electoral district, which is due to the new 17th electoral district.
The regions were redistributed after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old electoral district favoured the Republicans in violation of the Constitution.
Competition in the new 17th constituency has launched an economic struggle in the financial divisions of the main parties in the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name of Lambi became familiar with the special elections of the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania, followed widely in Pennsylvania.
The place had been in the Republican for over ten years and President Donald Trump won the area by 20%.
Political commentators have made a great move forward to the Democrats.
The United States planned to punish El Salvador for supporting China, but resigned from its intentions
The diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already noted the situation in Beijing and the mild response of Washington.
President Trump had a warm-minded meeting with Panaman President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and he also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners banished the Trump Organization team.
Officials of the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to invite the American diplomatic leaders back from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama "on the basis of quiet lines that no longer recognize Taiwan", said Heather Nauert in his earlier opinion this month.
However, sanctions were considered only to El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million of US aid for drug control, including development and economic support, in 2017.
The proposed penalties, including cuts of financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have severely affected the Central American State with a high level of unemployment and death crime.
In the course of the internal meetings, the North and Central American authorities delayed the high-level meeting on security and economic prosperity, which was seen as a step in attempts to prevent immigrants from seeking to the United States.
In mid-September, however, high administrative officials made it clear that the meeting was intended to move forward, and this decided effectively on speculation of the possible punishment of El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pencen is now expected to give a sign to the mid-October meeting of what importance the government gives to the meeting, as the diplomats said.
The three American ambassadors mentioned returned in silence to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any further misfortunate messages or punishment from Washington.
The President of the White House of Bolton refused to comment on the details of the discussion with three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal affairs anonymously.
Their report confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke in the protection of the condition of anonymity.
History Teaching
The next inevitable step may be the report by Special Lawyer Robert Mueller on the possible prevention of the right of President Trump, which is now very material in public documents.
Mueller has also been reported to conduct an investigation into whether the Trump campaign was secretly working with Russia when Russia was involved in the US elections.
If the power is changed in Congress, President Trump will find that he is accountable to it just when he is preparing to go back to his voters and possibly be judged.
There are many remarks here, and I do not mean to say that the loss of President Trump would be inevitable - more than the loss of similar people in Europe.
We need to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic, and those solutions determine how long this struggle will be.
In 1938, the German authorities would have been prepared to fall out of Hitler’s power if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed.
The course of history turns around to such turning points where the imperfect march of democracy either accelerates or delays.
The Americans now face many of these turning points.
What do we do if President Trump dismisses Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for investigating the Mueller case?
Rosenstein has been demolitioned since the public became aware that he had proposed a secret speech by the President and considered the possible inability of the President to carry out his duties.
According to Rosenstein, the Times report is incorrect.
"How do we react if the recently claimed FBI investigation of Brett Kavanugh's activities is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite the credible allegations of sexual harassment and unhonest witness statement?
And above all, are we voting on a Congress in the mid-election, which takes President Trumpi as responsible?
If we fail in these scenes, our democracy will end up in a long and dark winter.
But I believe we're successful because of the lessons I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew in Czechoslovakia, and she was expelled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government that once filled my diplomat.
He survived, moved as an immigrant to America, and sent me 60 years later to light the sabbaths on that table decorated by the hacker.
How could this heritage have more than an optimistic relationship with the future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans as an optimistic encounter with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will meet at home on Rapid Vienna Thursday, knowing that after the match against Villarreal in Spain earlier in the same month, the victory of the Austrians would give the team a strong position to get to the European League's G block.
The kneeblast prevented the middle-field player Graham Dorrans from getting into the field this season before Villarreal 2-2-game, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a push board for better results.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good resistance," says 31-year-old player.
"We went into the game with the expectation that we could get something and we brought a point.
Maybe we could have caught the win at the end of the win, but overall, the match is probably a fair result.
I guess they were better in the first half of the time, and we got to the other, and we were better.
On Thursday we will again have an important evening in the European League.
Hopefully we get three points, but it becomes a tough game, because their results were good in the previous game. However, I believe that with the support of this team we can give everything we can and achieve a positive result.
Last year was really hard with regard to my own injuries and changes in the team, but now the situation feels good.
The composition is good and the boys enjoy; the exercises go well.
Hopefully, we can now press full weight, leave the past behind the season and succeed."
Fear of pension savings causes women to sleep nights
Although the participants in the study had a clear view of how they wished to take care of themselves, few had talked about it to their loved ones.
About half of the participants in a global study reported to discuss the costs of long-term care with their spouse.
Only ten percent of respondents said they talked to their children.
"The people want a family member to take care of them, but don't talk about them," says Holly Snyder, Deputy Director of the National Life Insurance Company.
Let's start like this.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can’t prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell us your wishes in time.
Talk to a professional person and your family about where and how to get help, because these issues are an important factor in determining costs.
Involve economic advisers in the discussion: advice can also help to find a way to cover these costs.
Long-term care financing options may include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance to cover these costs or self-costing insurance, if you have the right to afford.
Prepare legal documents: prevent legal disputes.
Get a health care representative to identify a trusted person to supervise your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your hopes if you are unable to communicate with them.
Consider also the drawing up of a mandate for the management of your financial affairs.
It allows you to determine a trusted person to take care of the financial decisions for you and to ensure that your bills will be paid if you are not able to take care of them yourself.
Remember also the small details: imagine that your older parents would be on their way to the hospital because of a health emergency.
Can you answer questions about his medication and allergies?

Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunamis who attacked the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday. According to the authorities, the number of victims is expected to grow.
Since communication connections to the area have been interconnected, the rescue authorities have not received any information from the northern part of the region of the municipality of Donggala, which is closer to the surface centre of the 7.5 magnitudes.
More than 16 000 people have been evacuated since the disaster.
Key information about Palau and Donggala on the island of Sulawes:
The return is the capital of the central province of Sulawes, located on the west coast of the island of Sulawes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The earthquake and the tsunami hit the city's 40th anniversary.
The municipality of Donggala extends more than 300 kilometres (180 miles) of the northwest coastline of the island of Sulawes.
The municipality of Donggala is an administrative area under the province, with a population estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
The main industries in the economy of the central province of Sulawes, and in particular the coastal region of Dongga, are fisheries and agriculture.
Nickel harvesting is also important, but it has focused on Morowal on the opposite coast of Sulawes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, several tsunamis have been attacked in Palau and Donggala in the last hundred years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Tsunami also hit the west of Donggala in 1996 killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in a seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire area and often suffers from earthquakes.
Some of the most serious earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake in Northern Sumatra on the western coast of the province of Aceh in Indonesia caused a tsunami that struck 14 states and killed 226 000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims were in the region of Aceh.
2005: A series of violent earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 Magnitud squad hit the southern side of the Indonesian most inhabited island, Java, causing a tsunami that hit the island’s southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: 7.6 Magnitud squad hit Padang City, which is the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1 100 people were killed.
2010: The 7.5 magnitudes squad hit one of the Sumatran Mentawai islands, causing a ten meters high tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The surface earthquake hit the area of Acehin Pidie Jaya, causing destruction and panic in memory of the enormous destructions caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time no tsunami was born, but more than 100 people died when the buildings collapsed.
2018: Powerful earthquakes hit Lomboki’s tourist island in Indonesia and killed more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's elder son was arrested for domestic violence
The former Governor of Alaska and the oldest son of the Vice-President candidate, Track Palin, has been arrested for assault.
According to the Alaska police report on Saturday, Palin, 29 from Alaska Wasilla, was arrested as a suspect of domestic violence and of the prevention and opposition of domestic violence in connection with the arrest.
According to the police report, Palin took a phone from his female companion when he tried to call the police to report alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Detention Centre and a guarantee amount of $500 is charged, reports TV channel KTUU.
According to the report, Palin arrived in court on Saturday and said he was "naviously innocent."
Palin is charged with three Class A infringements, which means that he can receive a maximum of a year's imprisonment and a fine of $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B offence, which can be sentenced to day imprisonment and fines of $2,000.
Palin is not the first time to be accused of a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of abuse of his father Todd Palin.
At that time, Palin's mother called the police and reported the assault.
The case is currently being dealt with by the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, Palin was accused of domestic violence involving possession of a weapon under the drug effect.
Palin's girlfriend was accused of hitting Palin's face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin for combining her son’s violent behaviour with traumatic stress disorder due to the service done in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquake and tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have been killed since the earthquake struck the island of Sulawes in Indonesia on Friday.
The earthquake of 7.5 magnitudes caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication connections are broken down and the number of victims is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake hit just outside the middle of Sulawes, northeast of the city of Jakarta, Indonesia.
In the social media, videos are circulating at the moment of the shock.
Hundreds of people had gathered at the beach festivals in the city of Palau when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Attorneys Consider Prosecution of a rare death penalty to the suspect of the NYC terrorist attack
The U.S. Attorneys in New York are seeking the death penalty of Sayfullo Saipoville, a suspect of a terrorist attack of eight lives in New York City, which is a rare punishment that has not been enforced in the U.S. for a federal crime since 1953.
According to the charge, Saipov, 30, used Home Depot's rental car in his October attack on the south side of Manhattan on the West Side Highway, where he drove on pedestrians and bikers.
According to the report on the application for the death penalty in the southern state of New York, the death penalty is possible if the prosecutors are able to demonstrate that Saipov "targetably" killed his eight victims and caused "targetably" serious physical injuries.
According to the document, both of these charges can be sentenced to death.
After weeks of attack, the federal court brought Saipoville a 22-point accusation including charges for eight murders to assist the terrorist organisation, and the federal prosecutors typically use this criminal name in cases of organized crime, including charges for violence and destruction of motor vehicles,
The attack required "remarkable planning and preparation", the prosecutors said and described the way in which Saipov made his actions "awful, cruel and shameful."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families of Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Draken, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," states the announcement related to the accusation.
Five of the victims were Argentinan tourists.
The past time, when the Southern State Court of New York has issued a death sentence, it has passed a decade.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was found guilty of the murder of two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to lifetime imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last enforced in New York in the case of the federal state in 1953, when married couples Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were sentenced to a conspiracy for Soviet spying during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the legal documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not show any signs of repentance during the days and months following the attack.
He told the scientists that his actions felt good, the police told me.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that he had received an inspiration after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
The police said that Saipov also wanted the ISIS ticket to his hospital room.
He responded to the 22-point prosecution that he was innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal defence lawyers representing Saipov, said the defence was "naturally disappointed" of the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to require death penalty and recognition and lifetime without the possibility of release is a solution that only extends the trauma caused by these events to the parties," Patton said.
Saipov’s defense had previously asked him not to be required for the death penalty.
The Conservative Parliamentary said that Nigel FARAGE should be held responsible for Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised today at the demonstration against the Conservatives "mobilizing the civil army."
The former Ukip leader said that politicians must feel the pressure of Eurosceptics - when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians suggested that he should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative linemaker Peter Bone said to the marshals in Birmingham that Britain would "be out" if Farage was a brexit secretary.
However, May faces deeply divided lines in reconciling the challenge that the conservatives on the stand of the remains, associated with a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city, are undermining.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers compromise proposals on the surface of the brexit supporters and opponents, as well as the pressure on the EU.
The supporters urge him to continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the backlog - and to force the Euroscepticists and the Labour Party to make a choice between his proposal and chaos.
Bone said at Leave Means Leave's event in Solihulli he wanted to "push the Chequers proposal to go."
He proposed that Mr Farage should be involved and that he should be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have been out already," he said.
Wellingborough Parliamentary Representative added: "I am in favour of brexit, but the Chequers proposal must be removed."
He said his EU opposition: "We did not war World Wars to end subjects.
We want to set up our own laws in our own country."
Bone threw the idea that public opinion would have changed after the 2016 vote: "The fact that the British had changed their minds and would like to stay is a completely wrong claim."
The Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march and said to the journalists: "Sanon only: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people do not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote in favour of it, nor will it be supported by the members of the party, nor by the activists who are really going on the streets and are at all responsible for our success.
Give up the Chequers proposal and start listening."
In the message addressed to May, he added: "The Prime Ministers will be allowed to keep their work when they keep their promises."
Farage said that politicians should have to feel pressure if they were to turn the decision on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
This is now about trust between the people and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to water Brexit and we're here today to tell them that we don't accept it."
When speaking to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want politicians who are going to rotate the brexit to feel pressure from you."
"We are going to mobilise the army of the citizens of this country that gave us victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until Britain is again an independent, self-government and proud state."
In the meantime, the supporters of the stay were marching through Birmingham before the two-hour opportunity in the city centre.
A small group of activists threw the "Tories Against Brexit" signs.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party ridiculed the Conservatives about the security problems they had with the party's application at the beginning of the meeting.
"These are the people who say they're getting IT systems up and all technology for Canada plus plus arrangement and unbroken border functions for free trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a full farssi.
There is no good brexit," he added.
Warren is seriously considering presidential candidateship.
US senator Elizabeth Warren says he is seriously considering presidential candidateship after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reported that the masschustic Democrat spoke about his future in the city house in the Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, known for his repeated criticism of President Trumpi, will be confronted in November with the most ordinary Republican Geoff Diehl, who was the joint president of the Massachusetts campaign of Trump in 2016.
Warren has been expected to become a candidate against Trumpi in the 2020 elections.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was with his 36th meeting of voters after the beginning of the Trump season.
One of the participants asked if Warren was going to be president.
Warren replied that it is now time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman in the highest place.
Arrest in the case of LSU's shooting by Sims
On Saturday, Louisiana's Baton Rouge police announced that they arrested a person suspected of the shooting of the LSU basketball team that led Wayde Sims to death.
Baton Rouge's police reported Dyteon Simpson, 20, to be arrested at 11:00 a.m. at the ET briefing.
The police had published a video on the Friday shooting incident and asked for help to identify the man that was visible.
Sims, 20, was shot near the Southern University campus area early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims got shot in his head and died as a result," police officer Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through the 247 Sports network.
Wayde defended her friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted that he was in the interviews, held a gun and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson didn't arrest the resistance and he was taken to the East Baton Rouge police station.
Sims was a 198-cent junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games and 10 starts last season and his average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 album balls per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the world championship after the team arrangements offered him victory over Sebastian Vettel
When Valtteri Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became apparent that Mercedes' team arrangements were important in the competition.
Bottas got a good departure and left Hamilton almost his own happiness in defending his place in the first two rounds, calling Vellel to attack his teammates.
Wettel went to the cage first and left Hamilton to drive a bunch of hands, which should have solved the situation.
Mercedes later went on tour and returned after Vettel, but Hamilton passed after taking a little contact and after the Ferrari driver moved backwards from the internal line and abandoned his investment after two thirds of his movement.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started from the back line and was the seventh after the first round.
Afterwards, he was in the lead of a large part of the competition in extending the replacement of tyres in the aim of quick stopping and taking the fourth place from Kimi Räikkös.
He finally came to the bar in the 44th round, but couldn't increase speed in the eight remaining rounds when he took the fourth place.
This was a difficult day because the Valtteri performed great throughout the weekend and was a real gentleman when he left me.
The team has made an exceptional job by reaching a double win," Hamilton said.
Very bad body tongue
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein's claim that he did not disclose Christine Blasey Ford's letter, in which he accused the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
When speaking in Western Virginia, the President did not directly mention the testimony of Ford before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, but said that what was going on in the Senate was an indication of human "discretion, dishonesty and dishonesty".
"The one possible thing, the wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate in recent days, seeing anger, people who are angry, mean, dishonest and dishonest," the president said.
"When we see publications and shed things and then they say 'may, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, do you guys get this information?
Do you remember his answer... did you give the document - ’ oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Wait a minute.
Did we... No, we didn't leak," he added the senator.
In July, Feinstein received a letter describing the charges concerning Fordin Kavanaugh and the letter was released to the public in September, but Feinstein contested that the leakage would have occurred from his office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's charges, and I didn't leak his story," Feinstein said to the committee according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential in accordance with his wishes."
But his ban was not valid for the President who commented on this on Saturday: "I would say to you that was a very disgusting body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that was the worst language I've ever seen."
The President continued to defend the candidate of the Supreme Court who has been accused by three women of sexual harassment and thought that the democrats would use the accusations for their own benefit.
"They've decided to get back to power by any means.
You see that wickedness and disgustingness. They don't care who they hurt or who they have to walk over to get into power and control," the Media reports the President said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer made Giants two goals against Dundee.
Dundee Stars applied for compensation for the loss of the Elite League game against Belfast Giants on Friday by winning 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants had a leading role in the initial phase thanks to the two goals made by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team to the level before Dwyer returned Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard upgraded Dundee before Lukas Lundvald's two goals secured the victory.
This was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefe's men who won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
The teams met for the fourth time during the season after Giants won three previous matches.
Dwyer's opening hall came in the fourth minute in 3:35 from Kendall McFaulli's feed. David Rutherford did when Beauvillier doubled the lead position four minutes later.
In the scary opening period Sullivan brought home team back to the game in time 13:10 before Matt Marquardt fed Cownie's balancing field in time 15:16.
Dwyer secured Giants' leadership at the first batch at the end of the first batch of his second goal at the end of the evening.
The home team set up its line and Bouchard set up again on the supreme land in time at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran united their power and Nielsen managed to make Dundee the first leader at the end of the second round. He also secured the victory of his team in the fifth finish in the middle of the last round.
Giants, who has now lost four of his last five games, will meet at home on Friday at Milton Keynes.
The pilot died in ensuring that hundreds of passengers on the plane escaped from the earthquake
In Indonesia, the pilot has become a hero since he died in ensuring that hundreds of passengers transported the plane safely got into the air.
More than 800 people have died and many have been lost after the attack of a powerful earthquake and a tsunami caused by it on Friday on the island of Sulawes.
Powerful afterbearings are testing the area and several people have been trapped in the city of Palau.
Although their colleagues fled their lives in a merchandise, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung did not leave his job in a wildly disturbing flight management tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufr's airport in Palau.
He stayed there and ensured that the Batik Air flight 6321 on the runway was safely in the air.
After that, he jumped out of the flight management tower that he thought was crashing.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesian mediator Yohannes Sirait said that Agung’s decision could save hundreds of lives, reported in Australia’s ABC News release.
Kalimantan from Balikpapan was prepared for a helicopter to carry him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter came back.
"This news hurts our heart," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid that the number of victims will grow to thousands, because the country's disaster authorities have reported the links to the cities of Donggala, Sig and Boutong to be weak.
"The number of threats is believed to continue to rise because several bodies have been buried in ruins and many people have not been reached," said Sutopo Purwo, the agency's mediator.
Even the waves growing to six metres have destroyed the Fire, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and cargo machines bring help and equipment to the area.
35-year-old family mother Risa Kusuma told Sky News: #Ambulans bring bodies all the time.
There's a shortage of clean water.
The mini-markets are being robbed everywhere."
In CNN's interview, Director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, Jan Gelfand said: "The Indonesian Red Cross is hurrying to help the survivors, but we don't know what we're expecting.
This is already a tragedy, but it may prove even worse."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in return on Sunday, saying to the country's armed forces: "I ask you all to work every night so that all the evacuation tasks can be done.
Are you ready?" CNN newsed.
Earlier this year, more than 550 people were killed in earthquakes in Indonesian Lombok.
Micronesia Air Accident: According to Air Niugin, one person has disappeared since the plane crashed into the lawn
The representatives of the airline that crashed in the Pacific in Micronesia now report that one person is missing, although, according to the previous report, all 47 passengers and crew members had been safely evacuated from a landing aircraft.
Air Niugin said that after Saturday afternoon it has not been able to locate one male passenger.
The airline announced that it was trying to find a man in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and accident researchers.
The airline did not immediately respond to any further information on missing passengers, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane had attacked the water in trying to land at Cheuk airport.
On Friday, the authorities announced that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
According to the airline, six people stayed in the hospital on Saturday and everyone was stable.
The cause of safety and the precise course of events remain unclear.
The airline and the US Navy have both reported that the plane has landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes told me that the plane landed very low.
"It's very good," Jaynes said.
According to Jaynes, passengers were able to clamp in a sinking plane in deep water for emergency exits.
He told us that the passengers had panicked and cried, and that he himself had a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that Marines involved in the renovation of a close port facility by transporting people to the beach by a rubber boat before the plane fell into a deep water of about 30 meters (a hundred feet).
According to information from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in the ruin of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but Air Niugini has not joined the ruins.
The analyst presents a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the Attorney-General concluded a reprocessing procedure in which the man was accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst from the U.S. Ministry of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in the field of data analysis.
He described to the jury how he had used the data stored on the mobile phone when gathering together the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers's movements on the night of the victim's death.
Rowlett reported that he had received the location of several mobile phones that showed Tellis to be contrary to his previous claims with Chambers on the night he died, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the information showed that Tellis' cell phone was at Chambers at the same time as Tellis claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police interrogated Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis if he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that Tellis was lying because my car was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Based on the data stored on the mobile phone, they had only known each other a week.
Rowlett noted that at some point after Chambers died, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He wiped him out of his life," Hale said.
The final statements of the defence are planned to be launched on Sunday.
The judge said he was waiting for the trial to proceed to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
Hip hop trio wants to challenge the genre related negative concepts by making music that is full of positive messages.
According to the Bristolian The High Breed group, hip hop has been distant from the original, whose messages were linked to politics and social problems.
They want to return to the hip hip roots and make the conscious hip hop again popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have been able to prove a new rise in the UK with artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another darkness?!
New York childcare nurse challenges a couple for a racist text message
A New York nurse challenges a couple's right to discriminate against a child's divorce after accidentally getting a text message from his mother, in which he complains that he is "this one dark man".
The couple denies being racists and equals the challenge of "spirit."
Two children's mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her annoyance when the new nurse Giselle Maurice arrived at work on the first day of work in 2016 and turned out that this was dark.
"EIIIII, TAAS TUMMAIHOINEN", Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a text message.
But then she sent a message instead of her husband to Giselle Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, the troubled Plasco-Flaxman had dismissed Maurice, stating that their previous departure passports had been received by his African American nurse and had been waiting for the Philippines this time.
Maurice received a payment for one working day, and he was sent home by taxi.
Maurice now challenges a couple's court to receive compensation for divorce and wants for $350 per day for six months, for which he was initially being disturbed to live and work in the family, though without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't do that," he said to the Post on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple has responded to racist claims saying that terminating Maurice’s employment relationship was a justified solution because they could not trust him after he had been insulted.
"My wife sent him something she wasn't supposed to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco told me in the interview with Post.
"But would you leave your child in the sight of a person to whom you have been unfriendly, even if by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Really?"
Plasco compared the challenge with the extortion and I said that his wife had received the baby two months earlier and was "very difficult."
"Shall we start chasing another one in such a situation?
It's not very nicely done," the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still in progress, the public opinion has quickly condemned their behaviour and logic in the social media of the couple.
The new letter reveals that the Paddington publishers feared that the audience would not agree with the speaking bear.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born a short time after the adoption of the book, says in a letter: "It is difficult to live in the position of a person who read the book for the first time before the publication.
It's fun now that Paddington's huge popularity is known."
True that his father, who had worked as BBC's cameraman before dedication to writing children's books about toy bear adventures, would have been optimistic about rejecting his book, Jankel added that the 60th anniversary of the book publication seemed bitter because his father died last year.
Paddington he "described as a very important family member" and said his father was quietly proud of the success achieved by it.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and not at all a rehearsing guy," says the daughter.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a child's achievement to him; something you're proud of, although it's not really your own achievement.
I think he had Paddington's success that way.
Even though it was about his creation, he always gave the honour to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on my phone.
His daughter had been driven after the landing of the plane to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save his life in vain.
"Nad played a little bit and told me the situation was really bad that he was not expected to survive," Ednan-Laperouse says.
Then Nad called and said my daughter died in a few minutes and I have to say goodbye to her on the phone.
So I did.
I said, "I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm with you."
Medicinal products that enabled doctors to keep his heart running gradually disappeared from his body.
He had died a little earlier, and now it all turned out.
I could only sit there knowing that everything was over.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation where there were families and other people around me.
I had to keep myself together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who was mourning the loss of his daughter, climbed into an airplane among other passengers who didn't know anything about the trial he was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I kept my head down and the tears rolled all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a huge sympathy for Nadia.
That he now needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved my daughter."
Sad women send cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones work to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are sending cards with encouraging messages and phone numbers that can be supported.
Davis' son Tyler was depressed at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to experience the feelings I know every day," he said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says his son was a promising cook with a contagious inflammation.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile would illuminate the whole room."
But he ended his job before he died because he felt "in the darkness".
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old little brother found his brother who had taken his life from himself.
Davis says he's always afraid of the after-effects.
Davis created the cards "to tell people that there are people to go to talk, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay quiet. You have to talk."
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies for several years and he lost his partner Mark 15 years after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me he was underneath or depressed or anything like that," Humphreys said.
"A day before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was in the country on Christmas day, and when the children opened their gifts, he didn't take a look at them or anything like that."
He says that Mark's death was a severe trauma for them, but they have to find out, "It breaks up the family.
It's gonna break us apart.
But we just have to continue our life and fight forward."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at risk when the FBI starts his investigation.
"I was thinking that if we could really achieve what he wanted - timely and limited investigation - we could perhaps achieve some unity," Flake said on Saturday, and he added fear that the committee would "disrupt" the supporters' deadlock.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want FBI investigation?
It's a question of timing.
The intermediaries are only five weeks away, November 6th, and if the success of the Republicans is weak as expected, their attempt to be elected to the highest court of the country will be difficult.
George W. Bush has grabbed the phone and called the senators to praise them to give their support to Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report?
A vote will be held at the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, so Vice President Mike Pence could blow across the game and confirm his choice for the highest court.
The number of sprawls in North Korea will fall during Kim
According to the Korean legislator, the number of people who have fled from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took over seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug quoted the South Korean Ministry of Harmonization and reported that the gaps occurred last year in 1 127 - in 2011 they occurred in 2 706.
According to Park, the key factors have been the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in the prices of human traffickers.
There is no public comment on Pyongyang.
The majority of North Korea's loopholes are ultimately offered South Korea's citizenship.
Soul states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have become illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them flee through China because it has the longest border with North Korea and it is easier to cross than strongly protected demilitarised zone between the Koreos.
China treats sprawls as illegal immigrants, not as refugees, and most often returns them violently.
Technically, the relations between North Korea and South Korea in the war have improved significantly over the past few months.
Previously this month, the leaders of the countries met in Pyongyang and the discussions focused on the negotiations on the breakdown of nuclear equipment.
This followed the June Historical Meeting in which US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un met in Singapore and agreed at a general level on the efforts towards the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for being caught up with sanctions after the meeting.
"With no confidence from the United States, our national security is not on a reliable basis, and in such circumstances we do not in any case fall unilaterally into dismantling our equipment as the first," Ri said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court
Minority Director Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that this was temporarily inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court.
Your fear commented on this in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival event in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't fail to think that if a woman had acted like this, she would be called "hysterical", fear said her own reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs on Thursday.
Kavanaugh very emotionally banned the accusations that she had sexually afflicted Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenage.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was in the power of his feelings, and sometimes she almost shouted and lost her speech when she told me about her family and high school years.
He also clearly condemned the democrats of the committee without calling the accusations against himself as "great and planned persecutions against a person", which have organized the Liberals who were angry for the 2016 presidential loss of Hillary Clinton.
Your fear said he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not able to act in the Supreme Court because it showed him to be partial to the Democrats.
"I believe he made himself incompetent in his statements and in the way he attacked Clintons and Democrats," feared.
Your fear wondered when he was asked if he would raise an official charge against Kavanaugh if this choice was confirmed and if the democrats were given the majority in the Chamber of Representatives.
"Let's say this - if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he's not valid not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he is currently working," Fear answered.
Kavanaugh is currently working at the U.S. Federal Court of Appeal.
Your fear added that as a democrat, he was concerned about the possible provisions of Kavanaugh regarding health reform or the case of Roe v. Wade, because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative court.
In its confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would repeal certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not the right time for a hysterical and impartial person to be complained of as a member of the court and we are expected to see it be great," said Fear.
Women need to survive everything.
This is a legitimate fire-spoke in months and years of anger, and he cannot keep it without crying.
"We're crying when we're angry," Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, don't you think?"
He continued: "I was greatly helped by a woman who was in the leading position somewhere and who told me that she was also crying when angry, but that she had developed a way to say to her speaker in a situation where she was angry and began to cry:"You may think that I am now sad because I was crying.
I'm really mad."
And then he just went on.
And I thought it was genius."
The tears are justified as a way of decommissioning anger, although they are generally misunderstood.
One of the most memorable memories of my early work at a man-powered office is when I cried out of anger and an older woman - a cold-screamed superior I had always been a little scared - took me from the neck and pulled me into the stairs.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and then they're happy because they got your mind sorry."
Patricia Schroeder, then Congresswoman of Democrats from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in this presidential campaign.
When Hart was caught in 1987 with a non-marriage relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and got out of the race, the very frustrated Schroeder felt that there was no reason why he would not try to become president himself.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," he said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates and at least one more was dug.
Somebody called the situation "Snow and seven dwarfs."
Since the campaign was long, he was behind the collection of funds and so he announced that he would not go to the race unless he had two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of his supporters, who gave the male candidates $1,000, gave him only 250.
"Do they think I'm getting something off?" he wondered.
When he held his speech and announced that he wouldn't start a formal campaign, he had the power of his feelings - of gratitude to his supporters, of frustration, which made it so difficult to collect funds for voters and delegates, and of hate to the sexist - that he could not speak.
"I could have thought I'd get a nervous breakdown," Schroeder reminds me of the press's reactions.
"I might have thought that Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking that my tombstone must be beaten as a memorial.
"He was crying."
How the US and China Trade War can benefit Beijing
The launch of the US and China trade war was disturbing, and even though the fight is beyond everything, the intermediary can benefit Beijing in the long term, experts say.
US President Donald Trump gave the first warning earlier this year by imposing import taxes on the most important export articles in China, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new customs duties affecting import goods for USD 200 billion (£ 150 billion), effectively taxing half of all imports from China to the United States.
Beijing has responded each time at the same level, lastly by setting five to ten per cent customs duties on import goods worth US$ 60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States with an eye-to-eye style, and it does not seem that the second largest economic power in the world will be deteriorating for a while.
In order to get Washington to retreat, we should give up in our own demands, but public bouncing to the United States would be far too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the US trade war can have a positive impact on China in the long term by reducing inter-country dependence.
"A quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that start the economic downturn in either country and this is actually a more dangerous opportunity than the viewers have understood so far," says Abigail Grace, an expert research assistant in Asia at Center for New American Security.
According to the Syrian Foreign Minister, the country is "ready" to return refugees
Syria says that it is ready to volunteer to return to the refugees and asks for assistance for the reconstruction of the country after the devastating war that lasted more than seven years.
When speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country would improve.
"Your situation is now more stable and safe thanks to developments in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to correct the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore the normal situation.
The conditions now allow refugees to return voluntarily to the country from which they had to leave because of unilateral economic measures against terrorism and their daily lives and their livelihoods.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have escaped the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian assistance in the country.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian Government would be grateful for the assistance in the reconstruction of the destroyed land.
However, he stressed that the government did not accept conditional assistance or assistance from states that supported the rebellion.
The European team confirmed the Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup 2018, defeating the U.S. team at the endpoints of 16,5 against 10,5 Le Golf National off Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row in Europe, and it has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team held the crown itself when its Danish captain Thomas Bjørn team reached 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The American star player Phil Mickelson had difficulties almost throughout the tournament and he hit his start-up in the water at the 16-way par-3 track, giving a match to Francesco Molinar.
Italian Molinari shine at all rounds and he became one of the four players who have received the result 5-0-0 since the start of the tournaments in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth got out with the result of 5&4 the lowest ranked player in the European team, the Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, the world's top player, lost results 2 and 1 for Ian Poulter, who could now play his last Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cup golf veterans, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the winner of the tournament at a total of 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't do anything about it.
It's been a heavy year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed me.
I'm so happy to get this victory.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help you," said the moved Garcia after the European team won.
He transfers the ring to his countryman, Jon Rahm, who won the US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 at the individual competitions played on Sunday.
"I feel great pride after winning Tiger Woods. I grew up with her admiration," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has the Ryder Cup career record 13-21-3.
Strange statistics from one of the best players of all time who have won 14 big wins and remain second only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had difficulties finding trails throughout the weekend except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, whose game was high-level throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the U.S. team said after the failure of his team: "I'm proud of these friends, they fought.
We stressed the European team in the games this morning.
We've got it.
Honor to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We're regrouping, working with the American PGA and Ryder Cup committee, and we're moving forward.
These 12 guys are great and I'm proud to be their captain.
