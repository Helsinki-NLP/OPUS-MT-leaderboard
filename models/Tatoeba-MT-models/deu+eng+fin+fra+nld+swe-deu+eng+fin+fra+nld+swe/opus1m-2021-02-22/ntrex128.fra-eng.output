Members of the Assembly of the Wales Concerned to "go for puppets"
Walese elected are controversial with a proposal to replace their title with the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Wales Parliament).
This proposal stems from the draft amendment of the name of the Assembly, which would become the Parliament of Galilee.
In the political sphere, members of the Assembly believe that this could be the subject of riots.
An elected Labour Party stated that his group was concerned about the fact that the label "Rims with Twp and Pwp".
For readers not originating in Wales: in gallies, twp means stupid, and pwp means crotte.
According to one of its members, the Plaid Cymru (Parti of Wales) is not "satisfied" and has proposed other formulas.
The Conservative Party would be "open" to a name change, but noted that the distance between MWP and Muppet (marionette) is narrow.
In this context, in Galicia, the letter w is pronounced as the u English letter in the Yorkshire region.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently preparing the legislation introducing the change of name, stated that “the final decision on the appointment of the members of the Assembly is to the members of the Assembly”.
The Government of Wales Act, 2007 gives the Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as a Parliament in Wales, which was broadly supported.
On the issue of the title of the members, the Commission is in favour of Members of the Parliament of Galilee (or WMP); however, a large majority of Gallois prefer MWP.
It seems that the members of the Assembly are making other suggestions, but efforts to reach consensus could prove to be a real headache for Elin Jones, the President of the Assembly, who should submit a bill on change of name in the coming weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the functioning of the assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will take the final decision on the question of name in the debate on the bill.
Macedonia: referendum on the change in the name of the country
The Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now be called the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute between the country and its Greek neighbour, for which Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a long time, Athens has insisted on the fact that the name of Macedonia is a claim in its territory and has repeatedly imposed its veto on the accession of its neighbouring country to the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, opposed the referendum, said that he would not take the results into account.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that the change of name is only a small price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
Harlem: Churches in difficulty, Saint Martin's bells reduced to silence
"The elderly people with whom I talked say that traditionally there was a bar and a church in every corner of the street," says Mr. Adams.
"There is no more of them today."
He thinks it's normal that the bars have turned back.
Today, "you don't get together the same way," he explains.
"Previously, we went to the bar as with their neighbor, but that's no longer the case."
As for the churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will be exhausted long before what the leaders imagine, and this concerns him: "early or later, they will return to the field of departure".
He added that churches could be replaced by condominium complexs, inhabited by individuals who will not help maintain the last sanctuaries in the neighborhood.
"The people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will largely be the Whites who will hurry the closure of all churches, because it is unlikely that they will become members of it," he is concerned.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin 10 years later.
The initial white - methodist congregation abandoned the places in the 1930s.
A black congregation, preaching around, took possession of the building.
The church of St. Martin was taken over by a black community under the direction of Pastor John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott from the 125th Street shops, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, in which the Blacks painted to be used or promoted.
In 1939, a fire ravaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishmen prepared themselves to rebuild and ordered a new carillon,
that the son and successor of Father Johnson in the direction of the Church of St. Martin, Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the "bells of poor people".
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave him a different name: "a cultural treasure" and "unreplaceable historical instrument".
She also mentions that this is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took place in front of the larger carillon of the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather claims that Saint Martin did not replace him.
Over the past few months, much has been said about the household of architects and entrepreneurs, caused by the lay elite of the church on one side, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, the executive body consisting of lay officials, informed the diocese that he was concerned that the latter would want to impose the costs incurred on him, although he did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishmen regretted the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: a 13-year-old girl wounded by a shark during a part of lobster fishing
According to the authorities, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old last Saturday when he was fishing for lobster in California on the day of the opening of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. near the beach of Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV, San Diego's television channel, that he had dived with friends for half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming out of the water and started hiking up to him to get him out of the water.
In the first time, Chad thought that the young boy shouted of joy for having had a take, and then he understood that in reality he
had been bite.
When Hammel arrived near the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the clavier.
"I shouted for everyone to get out of the water: There's a shark!", Chad explains.
The boy was evacuated to the Rady Children Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The species of shark that caused the attack is not known.
At a press conference, the rescue chief Larry Giles informed that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of the torse.
The authorities closed access from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami to Ecinitas for 48 hours, to conduct an investigation and for security reasons.
Giles indicated that there are more than 135 species of sharks, but most of them are considered to be non-hazardous.
Sainsbury's offensive plans in the British aesthetic market
Sainsbury's made low-handed on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and the garnets of rays similar to those of supermarkets, packed with aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by field specialists.
As part of a major breakthrough in the British aesthetic market of GBP 2.8 billion, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and home items are falling, more extensive beauty products will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience is conclusive.
The supermarkets today invest in the beauty market to reuse the space previously occupied by TVs, microwaves and other household articles.
Sainsbury's indicated that he would increase the volume of his offers up to 3,000 cosmetic articles, which will include for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space in sectors similar to those of shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also revises its boutique makeup line to offer a majority of untested products on animals, an increasingly important criterion among young consumers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop seller will test concessions in two stores at Sainsbury's, the first opened last week in Croydon, south of London, and a second whose opening is scheduled in the course of the year in Selly Oak (Birmingham).
Supermarket leaders need to dig their heads to attract consumers, who are increasingly tending to make their online purchases and to move to nearby shops for daily food.
Mike Coupe, Director General of Sainsbury's, said that sales points will increasingly look like large surfaces, as the supermarket chain is trying to counter the Aldi and Lidl discount stores by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has set up Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and has also opened the doors of several Habitat stores, since the purchase of the two chains two years ago, which, according to the group, has allowed the sales of current consumer goods to be driven and the acquisitions made profitable.
The previous attempts to restructure the British chain's pharmaceutical and cosmetic product rays had been a failure.
At the beginning of the 2000s, Sainsbury's attempted a partnership with Boots, but it ended following a polemic on the distribution of benefits from pharmacies implanted in supermarkets.
The new strategy was implemented after selling its 281 pharmacies 3 years ago for an amount of GBP 125 million to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmaceutical Chain.
Lloyds had to play a role in the introduction into 4 stores of a wide range of high-quality skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of beauty products rays has been changed to improve the customer framework.
"We have also invested in training so that our staff can provide informed advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all types of needs and, thanks to the embellishment of our rays and the ideal situation of our establishments, our dominance of the cosmetics market is now undeniable and changes purchasing habits," said Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones' Colère after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from an agreement of 11 million £
Dragon's Den, Peter Jones, the star of the TV program, after Announcement of the withdrawal of Holly Willoughby from a contract of £11 million related to his home decorative brand, to devote himself to his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time to take care of the Truly interior decoration and accessories brand.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow Goop brand.
37 years old, this Morning's animator announced on Instagram that she would withdraw.
Holly Willoughby made Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, angry by withdrawing from their fruitful textile and interior decoration activity at the last minute, to devote himself to his new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources reported that Jones was angry when the child's love of the TV revealed, at a meeting that took place under tension at the headquarters of the Star of Dragon's Den commercial empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new contracts, up to 1.5 million pounds of sterling, no longer allowed him to take care of Truly, their decoration brand and interior accessories.
Truly's brand was similar to that of the actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the fortune of the animator estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, announced on Instagram that she left Truly, Jones jumped into her private jet to join one of her secondary residences outside the UK.
According to a source, " Truly was far from one of Holly's priorities
and is now in the process of ensuring its future for the next two decades.
His decision left everyone with no voice.
No one could imagine what was going to happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow's seat is filled with products ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the start of this Morning, which is one of the most "bankable" celebrities in Britain, could cause millions to be lost to society, due to significant investments in products ranging from cushions or candles, clothing or interior items, and the risk of delayed launch.
Moreover, this could put an end to long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, parents of three children, have been friends close to Jones and her wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52 years old, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
The couples went on holiday together and Peter Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby should become the brand ambassador for M&S and take the place of Ant McPartlin as an ambassador of the I'm A Celebrity ITV program.
A source close to Jones said last night that he did not want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was cool, but finally we love each other.
Trump has laughed at the media who criticize him because of his comment that some consider "unworthy of a president," and to be so positive to the North Korean leader.
"Why did President Trump give up so much?"
he screamed, taking a voice of TV journalist.
"I didn't give up anything at all."
He indicated that Kim Jong-un had expressed its support for a second meeting, after Trump had designated the first, which took place in Singapore in June, as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on this denuclearization are at the dead end.
More than 3 months after the June Summit in Singapore, the Head of North Korean Diplomacy, Ri Yong Ho, declared Saturday to world leaders, at the United Nations General Assembly, no "corresponding response" from the United States to the first disarmament measures in North Korea.
He regretted that, on the contrary, the United States continued to impose sanctions to maintain pressure.
In his speech of gathering Trump offers a much more optimistic perspective.
"Everything's fine with North Korea," says the North American president.
We have freezed the armed conflict.
"Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have an excellent relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim resulted in positive results: the end of missile shooting tests, the release of hostages and the remains of North American soldiers returned to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to access this arena full of cracking, there's hardly more than 200 standing in front of me," he cried by pointing finger to the crowd.
Tsunami: a desolate island and hundreds of deaths in Indonesia
After the earthquake that shaken Lombok, the assistance of foreign NGOs was supposedly not necessary.
More than 10 per cent of Lombok's population has been scattered, but no state of national disaster has been established, a condition required for the launch of international assistance.
"Unfortunately, they have often made it clear that they did not want international assistance, which makes things a little complicated," regretted Ms. Sumbung.
While the Save the Children organization set up a team to go to Palu, it still doesn't know if work on the ground will be allowed.
The spokesperson of the National Disaster Management Agency, Mr. Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities evaluated the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian aid.
Despite its constant swamps, the country lacks cruelly the means to protect itself from nature's caprices.
Refugees have been built in Aceh, but they are rare in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was issued, no alarm siren was held in Palu, which probably contributed to human losses.
Even in ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to another is not a simple thing.
Natural disasters make transport more difficult.
A hospital ship that had been posted in Lombok to treat the victims is now on the way to Palu, but it takes at least 3 days to reach the places of the new disaster.
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, placed infrastructure reform at the centre of his election campaign and spent considerable amounts to restore roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds undermined Mr. Joko's government, who was called to represent himself before the electors next year.
The Indonesian Head of State is also subjected to pressure on the persistence of inter-ethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority exercise their faith more conservatively.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives and dozens of thousands have been hunted from their homes, on the ground of confrontations between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, arches and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.

Chelsea led 1 to 0 in the mid-time after a goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard at the 25th minute.
The Blues attacker swinged a pass towards Mateo Kovacic, before going to the middle of the ground and sprinting on the side of Liverpool.

Then a beautiful shot in depth that led Hazard into the surface.
Hazard crossed the defense and ended his race in the net of the second pole, with a left foot shot behind the Liverpool gate, Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will confront the Napolitans in the group phase of the League of Champions, Wednesday at 3 p.m. in the San Paolo Stadium of Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europe League, at 3 p.m. this Thursday in London.

Parliament: Cromwell's statue, the last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
Its ban would be the right return of things, given the acts of destruction, countless religious and cultural property of England, committed by its puritan supporters, such as the fanatic Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society considers Mr. Crick's proposal "unreasonable" and called it "revisionist attempt".
The President of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, states that, "behold the current debate about the withdrawal of statues, it was obvious that Oliver Cromwell's built in front of the Westminster Palace would not be spared.
Cromwell neither ordered nor led iconoclasm during the English civil wars.
It is likely that his person was sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas during the previous century.
The superb representation of Cromwell, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, proves the consideration that we had for him in the nineteenth century and belongs to the history of a personality that many of us still celebrate."
Mr. Goldsmith said in Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the nineteenth century than today, as a parliament defender against external pressure, I mean, of course, monarchy.
The fact that this representation is precise or not is a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that broke out in the middle of the 18th century has formulated the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure that represents one side of the fracture.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be emphasized and commemorated."
China: a pig kills a breeder
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a Southeast China market.
Identified as M, Yuan, man was found dead, the artery sliced and covered with blood near a porch on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, said Sunday the South China Morning Post.
A pig breeder is preparing to inject pig vaccines in a porcelain on May 30, 2005 in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
He would have traveled with his cousin from the surrounding province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin returned to death and discovered that a door of the nearby porch was open.
He claims that there was a huge male pig inside and blood flowed from his mouth.
A medical-legal report confirms that the 250 kg weighted animal mutilated the livestock.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the breeder's cousin, said that "his legs were crushed and covered with blood."
Security cameras show Mr. Yuan coming to the market at 0440 a.m. on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig that caused Mr. Yuan's death belonged neither to the breeder nor to his cousin.
A market leader told Evening News that the animal was locked in order to avoid any other incident and allow police to collect evidence.
The family of the farmer Mr. Yuan and market leaders would be negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, swine attacks on people have already been reported.
In 2016, in a farm at Massachusetts, a pig attacked a woman and her husband, seriously hurting her.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 295 kg caught a gallow breeder on his tractor before his wife managed to get away from him.
In 2012, while an Oregon breeder was just eaten by his pigs, a Manitoba farmer claims to CBC News that it is not an aggressive animal in principle, but that blood taste can cause this kind of behaviour.
"These are animals rather players,
Very curious kids... they have no intention of hurting.
Just show them the respect they owed," he assures.
Rests of the Rosa Hurricane should cause severe precipitation in the southeast of the United States
According to forecasts, the hurricane Rosa weakened as it moves above the colder waters of the northeast coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will lead to reverses in the northeast of Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
Winds were blown at 135 km/h (category 1 hurricane) since 5 h in the morning, East Sunday time, while Rosa was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
The hurricane should move to the north Sunday.
In the meantime, a depression begins to occur over the Pacific Ocean and flows eastwards, towards the west coast of the United States. As it is coming near the Lower California Peninsula in the form of a storm on Monday, the Rosa Hurricane will produce intense tropical humidity to the north, in the southwest of the United States.
It will fall up to 25 cm of rain in areas of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical humidity combined with close-up depression will create general torrential rains in the southwest in the coming days.
At the local level, precipitation between 2.5 and 10 cm will cause sudden crude, debris flows and potential land slides into the desert.
The waterfalls will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour per place, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It is expected to fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in areas in the southwest, including a large part of Arizona.
Disseminated tropical rains are likely to cause subsequent floods and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is highly unadvisable to adventure in the desert on foot because of the threat of tropical rainfall.
Intense rain could convert canyons into dischained rivers and storms will produce winds and dust turbulences per place.
The approaching depression will cause abundant local rainfall in some southern regions of the country, on the California coast.
The total rainfall may reach more than 1.3 cm, which could lead to weak debris casts and make the shoe slippery.
This could be the first rainfall in the dry season in the region.
Dispergated tropical floods will reach Arizona Sunday at the end of the day and early on Monday morning, then will intensify later on Monday and Tuesday.
Strong precipitations will be struck at the four corners of the country Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
Significant temperature changes are to be expected for the month of October through the United States due to the Arctic refreshment, but the climate of tropicals will remain warm,
which sometimes causes a radical change in time over short distances.
The United States Central Region, which will experience considerable temperature differences on Sunday, is a perfect example.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between Saint Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to infiltrate and intensify again.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to have a hot beginning of October, with rounding temperatures of around 26 degrees covering the southern plains and other northeast regions.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the season average.
Several-day forecasts indicate that temperatures are expected to exceed the average in the east of the United States during the first fifteen of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
Translated on 6 television channels on Thursday, the invasive hearings of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused her of sexual assault in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
While the political impasse persists, broadcasters have interrupted their usual Friday program to announce a theater attack: an agreement imagined by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, to allow the FBI to conduct an investigation into charges for one week.
In front of the Senate Judicial Commission, Christine Ford assured to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh, under the effect of alcohol, had carried himself to his or her person and had tried to remove his or her clothes during a high school evening.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate draw, also claimed to be 100% certain that this had never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial probably reached an audience of more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers of other trial channels, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen is not always able to estimate the number of people watching TV at the office.
As a comparison, the trial attracted as many people as a football game or Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose promoters largely supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was the most viewed channel on the day of hearings, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC took second place with a hearing of 3,26 million.
Following CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), still according to Nielsen.
The interest did not fall as soon as the hearing had been completed.
Flake was at the center of the drama that played Friday.
After the moderate Republican office published a statement that it would vote for Kavanaugh, the cameras of CNN and CBS revealed a scene in which the senator was taken part by demonstrators while trying to take the elevator to attend the court hearing.
Flake dropped his eyes for several minutes, while CNN retransmitted the sequence of the live interpellation.
"Don't look elsewhere, look at me," throws one of the women.
"Do you really think he's telling the truth?
You hold the power while so many women are poor."
Before the elevator doors closed, Flake indicated that his office issued a statement and that he would make more of it at the meeting of the Committee.
All cable and radio channels covered the live session a few hours later, while the judicial committee was preparing to vote on the procedure to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh throughout the Senate.
Flake, however, indicated that a one-week investigation should first be conducted by the FBI on the charges against the candidate, as minority democrats claimed.
Flake was partially persuaded by discussing with his friend, Senator Democrat Chris Coons.
He made his decision after meeting with Coons and several other senators later.
His choice was heavy in the balance, because the Republicans would not actually have obtained the votes to approve the appointment of Kavanaugh without a prior investigation.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate the charges of Brett Kavanaugh's sexual assaults.
Great Britain: May accuses opponents of Brexit of making "small policy"
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the distractors of his project to leave the European Union, to do "small policy" to the detriment of the future of Great Britain and national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, September 29, 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which published a picture of Theresa May in cover, his former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Boris Johnson continued his attacks on his so-called Chequers plans, stating that the free trade proposal between the UK and the European Union was "literary".
Wayde Sims: police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of being the cause of the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect of the fatal shot that led to the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketballer.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20 years old, has been incubated and is accused of second-degree murder, said the Baton Red Police Service.
The authorities published a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police reported that Sims had lost his glasses during the alteration.
At the crime scene, the glasses were wearing Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of the CBS group.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed to the police to be responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was fixed at $350,000.
The law doctor's office of the Baton-Rouge parish published a preliminary report on Friday, which determines that death was caused by a bullet that crossed the head and lived in the neck.
The police department recognizes the assistance received by the Fugitive Task Force of Louisiana State, the state police medical laboratory, the Southern University police, as well as citizens in the investigation leading to the arrest.
The sports director of the LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the law enforcement for their "commissioning and seeking justice".
Sims was only 20 years old.
1.98 m per 98 kg, the player grew up in Baton-Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and scored 2.6 rebounds per match in the last season.
Friday morning, Will Wade, LSU basketball coach said that the team was "devastated and shocked" after the news of Wayde's death.
"We fear this type of event all the time," said Wade.
Mexico: a crushing ashes volcano
The ashes escaped from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre recommended that the Mexicans move away from the volcano, after registering a peak of activity in the crater, with 183 gas and ashes emissions in 24 hours.
The centre monitored several groundings and tremblings from Popocatepetl.
On social networks, the images showed fine ash layers covering car brushes in Mexico City districts, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity at 72 km from the capital, since a 7.1-large earthquake shake Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: Confrontations between police and separatists in the approach to the anniversary of voting for independence
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after confrontations between independent demonstrators and the anti-invasion police, while thousands of opponents joined protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being rebuilt by anti-ruth police, masked separatists threw eggs and coloured powder, creating dust clouds in the streets, which usually do not deplete tourists.
Heaters also blasted later in the day, while the police used matraques to contain confrontations.
For several hours, groups in favour of independence who scanned " neither forget nor forgive" faced unionists crying "long life in Spain".
14 demonstrators with mild injuries were treated, according to the local press.
A year after the referendum of 1 October, which was judged illegal by Madrid but celebrated by the Catalans in favour of separation, tensions remain strong in the independent region.
A overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite a low participation rate, the opponents of the secession having largely boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police had tried to prevent Catalans from accessing the polling stations in the region.
Independent groups had camped on Friday night to block a demonstration of support to the national police.
This was nevertheless a place, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said that he had no hope for Catalonia's independence.
"We have witnessed a great time last year.
My parents were crying with joy to the idea of voting, but now we are in an impasse," he regrets.
Despite their major victory, though slight, at the regional elections last December, the independent Catalan parties had difficulty in maintaining the momentum this year, with many popular leaders being exiled or detained waiting to be judged for organizing the referendum and declared Catalonia's independence.
Joan Puig, 42-year-old mechanic, filming the police support demonstration on his phone, considers that politicians are responsible for blocking the situation, both on the one hand and on the other.
"The tension only rises," he regrets.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the 9 Catalan leaders in prison waiting for a judgement since last year, announced his intention to apply to the European Parliament elections next year.
"This is for me the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish government has dischased," he adds.
Arrest at Londonderry: Men hit a house by car

Captain Bob Blemmings indicated that the doors and walls were damaged.
The car would also have received arrow shots.
Livingston wins game 1 to 0 against Rangers thanks to Menga
The first goal of Dolly Menga ensures the victory of Livingston
Recently, Livingston's team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second victory in 18 games to Steven Gerrard, the current Ibrox club coach.
Menga's goal made the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to position itself in the second position of the ranking, in equal terms with Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are deprived of victory outside in the Premiership League this season, and have to confront Sunday the Hearts team, which leads 8 points.
But before, the Rangers will meet the Vienna Rapid on the occasion of the Europa League on Thursday.
As for Livingston's team, she extends her invincible race in the division, and her principal coach Holt, who has replaced Kenny Miller since last month, may be deceived to have not yet lost any meeting.
Livingston missed an opportunity against enmoussed opponents
Holt's team could have gone ahead long before marking, because their direct approach put the Rangers in trouble.
Scott Robinson tried to perceive but remained in the face of the opposite goal; followed by a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a headache by Craig Halkett.
The Livingston team let the Rangers possess the balloon, knowing that it could hinder them by working tactics.
That's where the decisive goal came up.
The Rangers granted a free shot and Livingston tried to open; Declan Gallagher and Robinson allies to catch Menga, who took a touch and engraved a goal in the field.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated the game but faced an impenetrable defense and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was rarely concerned.
The second half of the time was the same, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to stop.
Allan McGregor's Rangers Guard stopped Scott Pittman's hit, while Lithgow managed to play out one of Livingston's plans.
Livingston's guard rejected all attempts and protected his cage, while two punishments were refused by the arbitrator, one for the provocation of Halkett directed against Glenn Middleton and the other for a hand error.
Livingston's "Phänomen" - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of the BBC Scotland, to Tony Macaroni Arena
A wonderful performance and results for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this ascending slope.
Their style and composition of the team have virtually not changed since their return to the summit, but merit is largely returned to Holt for having a team motivated since its arrival.
which counts many major players.
Captain Halkett's defense was great and beautifully organized, and Menga managed to keep Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall breathing throughout the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level reached with Gerrard, they were not up to their past talent.
They missed one last opportunity and managed to penetrate the opposite side only once; this is a warning for the Rangers, which are in the middle of the table.
Mixed Home of President Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday 29 September, the Turkish and German leaders met around a breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations between NATO's allies.
Various issues have been addressed, such as human rights, press freedom or Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne to inaugurate one of the largest mosques.
One of the most important Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Invoking security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 demonstrators from meeting in front of the building, while many supporters have been able to approach their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurds, have made their voice heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to welcome him in his country.
The gap that emerges from the protests reflects the double vision of Erdogan: a visitor welcomed in heroes by some Turkish Germans and qualified as self-sufficiency by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred at approximately 10.15 local hours, near the connection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a frequent road from Deptford to the southeast of the city.
The vehicle driver stopped, the relief arrived on site, but the man died at the accident site.
This accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that took place on Saturday.
The London police stated that the officers were doing everything they could to identify the individual and prevent his relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus deviations have been set up. Automobilists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: 6 injured officers during an uprising
The High Security Prison Officer stated that six prison officers had been injured during a rebel.
The uprising began in the HMP Long Lartin prison, located in Worcestershire, about 09:30 local hours this Sunday. It is still not under control.
Specialized anti-invasion officers were sent to unlock the situation, involving 8 prisoners and contained in a prison wing.
On the spot, the agents were treated for light facial injuries.
A spokesman from the prison management said: "Specially trained personnel have been deployed to restore order in HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six agents were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons. The officials will have to respond to the police authorities and see their sentences prolonged."
More than 500 prisoners, including criminals considered to be the most dangerous in the country, are detained in HM Long Lartin prison.
In June, the prison director was hospitalized following an aggression by a prisoner.
In October last year, anti-invasion officers were sent to prison to prevent serious disruption: prisoners had attacked staff with billard balls.
Ouragan Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by subite crude (which could be beneficial for drought-affected areas)
It is rare that tropical depression affects Arizona, but that is probably what will happen at the beginning of next week. The Hurricane Rosa is heading towards the southwest desert with what remains of energy. This region could be affected by subite crude.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for the west of Arizona, south and east of Nevada, southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should head directly to Phoenix Tuesday, with advertiser rains from Monday night.
The National Weather Service based in Phoenix said in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have kept the stage of depression or tropical storm in a 300 km perimeter around Phoenix since 1950!
The Hurricane Katrina (1967) stopped at 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest estimates of the National Hurricane Center provide for 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm per place in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert including the Central Rocky Area and the Great Basin should record 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with total insulated measurements of up to 10 cm.
Rosa's rains could save areas affected by drought that are not exposed to the risk of drought.
Although the risk of flooding should not be taken at a slight rate, rain could be beneficial for the southwester region, given the current drought.
According to the United States drought monitoring system, a little more than 40% of Arizona has at least one extreme-category drought, the second most severe-category," reports weather.com.
The Rosa Hurricane begins its way on the coasts, in the Lower California peninsula.
Still with great power Sunday morning and generating winds up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moved north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm hits the cold waters of the Pacific and thus loses its strength.
It should reach the Mexican coast with the force of a hurricane Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
In some areas of Mexico, precipitation could be massive and lead to a risk of flooding.
"In total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of precipitation is expected from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora and can reach up to 25 cm," said weather.com.
Rosa will then cross Mexico north, with the force of a tropical storm, and reach the Arizona border on Tuesday, early in the morning, as a tropical depression. It will cross Arizona and South Utah on Tuesday evening.
"Torrential rain is expected in Lower California, northwest of Sonora and the southwest desert and is the main danger," explained the National Hurricane Center.
It is estimated that these precipitations will result in potentially fatal subtle crues and debris flows in arid areas, as well as land slides in mountainous areas.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and one 20-year-old man were arrested under murder attempts after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace district of Midsomer Norton, on Saturday about 4:00 a.m. local time.
He was sent to the hospital. His condition is currently stable.
The Avon and Sommerset police reported that they had arrested the four young people (aged 17, 18 and 20 years old) in the night on the side of Radstock.
Agents called people who could have filmed the scene with their phone.
Trump declares that Kavanaugh has been victims of wickedness and anger of democrats
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the unpleasant and scandalous methods of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a meeting in Wheeling in Western Virginia.
Trump argued that Kavanaugh had been the victim of the wickedness and anger of the democrats throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh spoke to Congress on Thursday, rejecting with energy and emotion the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused her of sexually assaulting her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people have witnessed Kavanaugh's intelligence and courage" this day.
"A vote in the direction of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the direction of one of the most successful lawyers, with a brilliant career in the public service," he explained to the crowd of supporters gathered in Virginia-Occidental.
The President indirectly referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he mentioned the importance of the participation of the Republicans in the mid-mandate elections.
"We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I am not a candidate, but I am more involved than ever," he said.
"That's why I fight on all fronts for great candidates."
Trump said that the Democrats were in a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
The first decision-making procedure vote in the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place by Friday, according to the statement of a collaborator of the Republican party to CNN.
Indonesia: a earthquake and a tsunami make hundreds of victims, the balance continues to grow
On Saturday, the authorities reported that at least 384 people had died, most of them being transported by huge waves that killed themselves on the beaches while a earthquake, followed by a tsunami, struck the Indonesian island of Celebes.
On Friday, hundreds of people met for a festival on the beach in Palu, when waves of six metres high underwater the beach at the fall of the night. They took many lives and destroyed everything on their passage.
The earthquake, of a size of 7.5, preceded the tsunami.
"When the threat of the tsunami occurred yesterday, everyone was still on the beach. People did not escape immediately, it cost them life," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not arrive alone. He trained cars, pieces of wood, houses, he took everything with him," Nugroho explained, stating that the tsunami had moved in the sea at the speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people could save their lives by climbing the trees, he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 Palu centres.
Air images published by the Disaster Management Agency show destroyed buildings and stores, deformed and collapsed bridges, as well as a water mosque.
Replies continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the Friday earthquake was 200 times higher than the power of the atomic bomb released on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which should be a long, narrow bay, could have increased the size of the tsunami, she explained.
According to Nugroho, the damage is considerable; thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
corpses were found trapped under ruined buildings, he added, stating that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said that human and material losses could be more significant on the 300 km coast to the north of Palu, a region called Donggala, nearest to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were "completely paralyzed" since Donggala, said Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there," said the Red Cross in a communiqué, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading towards affected areas.
"The situation is dramatic and could well worsen," she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not spreading the information that a tsunami had affected Palu, although agents reported that the waves had arrived when the warning was published.
A shared amateur video on social networks shows a man upstairs of a building screamingly to the passers on the street that a tsunami approaches.
A few minutes later, a water wall descended on the coast, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not authenticate the images immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a general electricity failure that cut all communications to Palu, so it was difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army has begun to transport cargo aircraft assistance from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuated persons still have a great need for food and other basic needs.
The city airport has resumed in relief operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo had to visit Palu evacuation centres Sunday.
Indonesia: the status of the victims of the tsunami increased, more than 800 people died.
It's a tragedy.
Donggala's World Vision staff arrived safely and safely in Palu, where they found refuge in shelters in the courtyard of their offices. On the way, they discovered devastation scenes, explains Doseba.
"They told me I had seen many houses destroyed," he explained.
It's a tragedy.
When the aid groups started to help the injured, some complained that highly experienced foreign humanitarian workers had not had the right to travel to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, funds, supplies and foreign personnel may enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that's not yet the case.
"This disaster is always considered regional," explains Aulia Arriani, spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government declares that this is a national disaster, international assistance can intervene, but we are always waiting."
When the second night after the earthquake and Friday's tsunami fell on Palu, the relatives of the missing people were still hoping for a miracle.
Saturday, a little boy was found in the sewage.
On Sunday, the saviors released a woman seized under the drowning for two days, near her mother's body.
The coach of the Indonesian National Parapente Team, Gendon Subandono, had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Others of his students were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, added Mr. Mandagi.
"As an elder in the discipline of the paraplute, I have lived my own dramas," he explains.
In the hours that followed the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the parade community, Mr. Gendon told that he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
His messages were unanswered.
"I think they never received my messages."
In Newport on the Levee, thieves subtle $26, 750 when rechargeing an automatic distributor
Friday morning, thieves extorted $26, 750 to a Brink's agent who recharged an automatic distributor in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport police release.
The driver of the vehicle evacuated a distributor in the entertainment complex and prepared to feed it," explains Inspector Dennis McCarthy in the release.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money for the distributor.
Witnesses would have seen many suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person with information about their identity is requested to contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name and becomes Ye
Ripper Kanye West is now called Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Antiquity known as Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West, who has been called Ye for some time, used this surname as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before he went to the Saturday Night Live show, where he should present his new album, Yandhi.
His participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who canceled his arrival for "emotional reasons," explained the program's creator.
In addition to being the abbreviation of his current professional pseudo, this surname also has a religious meaning for West.
"I think "Ye" is the most used word in the Bible, where it means "you," West explained earlier this year, referring to the title of his album with his host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us.
I passed from Kanye, which means "the only", to Ye - reflects good, evil, confusion, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are."
West is not the only known rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs was called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has worked with West in the past, has also played on the line of union and majors.
In Mexico, AMLO states that he has never resorted to military force against civilians.
The elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use military force against civilians, almost fifty years after bloody repression of the law enforcement forces against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in the place of Tlatelolco that " never use military force to suppress the Mexican people."
On 2 October 1968, the troops opened fire at a pacifist demonstration, killing 300 people at the time the student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has committed to supporting Mexican youth by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities pushed young people to join criminal gangs.
United States should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research funding in this sector, according to the investor and expert in artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements occur after several actors in the U.S. government made announcements about IAS, while an official IAS strategy is missing in the United States.
In parallel, China presented its roadmap last year: it plans to become the leader in innovation IA by 2030.
"Double the funds for IA research would be a good start, because all other countries have a long advance on the United States, and we are looking for the next big discovery in IA," Lee explains.
Double the funds could double the chances that the next key step in the IA area comes from the United States, said Lee to CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most important IA companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an IA system that beat the best-class American Othello player. He then integrated Microsoft Reasearch management team and became president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee has already participated in technology competitions organized by the US government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next competition would take place, to identify visionaries.
According to Lee, American researchers often have to work hard to obtain government funding.
"It's not China that owns academic leaders, it's companies," says Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited large academic names to work on IA.
Lee added that changes in immigration policies could also support United States IA efforts.
"I think green cards should be automatically granted to IA researchers," he said.
The Chinese State Affairs Council revealed its new generation of artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to members of academic institutions, as well as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower," Lee explained.
Earlier in the year, the United States Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which must involve industry and academic partners. The White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million a year in research in IA.
At the same time, US legislation that is working to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action for several months.
Macedonians participate in the referendum on the name of their country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia heard their vote at a referendum on the change of their country's name for the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would resolve an old dispute of several decades with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's request for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, one of the provinces called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour represents a right in its territory and opposed its veto on its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two Governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would affect the ethical identity of the majority slave population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote during the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts as to whether a minimum of 50% of participation required to validate the referendum would be achieved.
The question of the referendum was: "Are you in favour of accession to NATO and the EU under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?"
According to the supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to be paid for joining organizations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, resurrected from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, which means a safer life for each of us," said Skopje, 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough members of Parliament have stated that they would follow the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a majority of two thirds in Parliament.
The State Election Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 1 p.m.
But the participation was only 16 per cent, while it had reached 34 per cent at the same time during the last parliamentary elections in 2016 which had mobilized 66 per cent of the voters who were registered at the end of the election.
"I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe," says 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko participated in the referendum and voted for the change of name, in order to open the vote for membership of NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In Parliament, in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small scene and has seats in front of tents installed by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter through the big door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in the Eurasian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, accession to NATO will allow Macedonia to benefit from the necessary investments. The unemployment rate in the country exceeds 20%.
"I think that a large majority will be favourable because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO," said Mr Zaev after filing his newsletter.
He added that a "yes" would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would intend to participate in the referendum, which is below the expected participation rate.
Another survey, organized by the Macedonian Telma chain, estimated the participation at 57 per cent.
70 per cent of the voters said they would vote "yes".
For the referendum to be valid, 50% of the vote plus one vote is required.
The failure of the referendum would be the first hard blow to the pro-western government policy since its take-over in May last year.
Decisive action: Sergio Aguero, from Manchester City, breaks a path through Brighton's defense to mark
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's defenders in Manchester and won the 2-0 game on Saturday at the Manchester Etihad Stadium.
The goal of Aguero, at the 65th minute, seemed to be the simplest action in the world for the player.
The Argentine killer received the ball in the middle of the field, at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, before dive on the ground.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green sweaters.
He circumcised a defender before evading the others near Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling, on his left.
The English front took advantage of it to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to deceive Brighton's guard, Mathew Ryan, with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet," explained Pep Guardiola, the team coach, to journalists.
"We said he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We had the luck that he marked at that time."
But it was Sterling who had given the first advantage to the Skyblues in the First League game,
From the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ballon directly on the ground of Brighton.
He sent him to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane made a few keys before leading Sterling to the second pole.
The front of the Skyblues sent the balloon into the nets just before slipping out of the field.
City will confront Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 1255 a.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play party trouble against the Rockies
Since the Nationals team was removed from the playoff race, there was no reason to start a new game.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only in case of an eliminating game for the Rockies, true legends in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers of the West League division.
The Rockies took him 5-2 in front of the Nationals Friday night, but they are still trying to secure their first division title.
"Although this game has no stake, we want to crowd the field in Denver, with this atmosphere, with the crowd, and face a team that will probably play at the highest level I will face this year.
Why would I not want to participate?"
Nationals still have to announce a launcher leaving for Sunday, but would be inclined to leave the place to Scherzer, in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th departure, will be in training on Thursday and launch on his usual rest day, Sunday.
Washington's right-wing is 18-7 with an average of 2.53 and 300 points earned on catches in 220 steps and two thirds this season.
Trump's interventions in Western Virginia
The President referred to the situation that has generated his support to Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court by talking about the importance of the participation of the Republicans in the mid-mandate elections.
"All our actions will have an impact in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is a major issue. I am not a candidate, but I am more involved than ever. That's why I fight on all fronts for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued "You see this terrible, truly terrible radical group of democrats, you see it in the work.
And they are determined to take over power by all means. See their wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they crush to take power and control. That's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give them."
Democrats are in a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"You can see it over the last four days," he added, before qualifiing the Democrats as "in anger, evil and liar."
He referred to the Judicial Committee of the United States Senate and the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which made him appreciated by the public.
"Do you remember his answer?"
Did you disclose the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no. I'm waiting for one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the great community he was.
It is not tolerant to those who express their ideas
When activists of the Momentum movement of my local party voted to censor me, it was not a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a line of parliamentarians of the Labour Party considered not welcome, all of this for expressing our ideas.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, received the same treatment because she opposed anti-Semitism.
As far as I am concerned, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are topics for which Jeremy himself disagreed with the previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East Labour gathering on Friday said: "We want the gathering to be inclusive and productive."
That is exactly what the Friday evening general meetings were for my eight years as a parliamentarian of the Labour Party.
Unfortunately, today it is not the case with many gatherings and the promise of more gentle and respectful policies has been forgotten for a long time, if it has never been taken into account.
It has become clear that the opposite opinions are no longer tolerated within the party. Each opinion is judged according to its acceptance by the leaders of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy's power-taking. The colleagues with whom I thought to share the same political vision began to expect me to return my jacket and to take positions against my beliefs, whether on national security or on the EU internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, there was an abuse of the social network, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the centre, saying that I should not be a member of the party.
And it's not just my experience.
Moreover, I am more likely than some of my colleagues, because the comments that had been sent to me were of a political nature.
I am admired by the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a deterrent of sexist or racist speech every day, but who do not lose their arms.
One of the most disappointing things in today's policy is the standardization of the various forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this large community and that the party is confined to the challenge motions and changes in the rules of selection.
I've been given a lot of advice in the last two years: drop your eyes, don't express my ideas so strong, and everything would be fine.
But it's not to act as I do politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolchildren, because the negligence of the Government of Thatcher had caused the collapse of my classroom. Since then, I wanted to work for better public services for those who needed it most, whether as a local advisor or minister of government.
I never concealed my political ambitions, even during the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be disturbed by my political positions and my disputes with the current party leaders.
All I would like to say to those who have defended the motion on Friday is that the country is going to a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services. I don't think this is really the time to waste time and energy by debating my loyalty to the leader of the party.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my voters, whether they are working or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will prevent me from acting for the reasons I defend, which are your interests to all.
Chris Leslie is a parliamentarian for the district of Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr remains invincible
Two late trials may have distorted the final result, but no doubt about it: Ayr deserved this triumph following the intense match of the rugby Championship of Scotland at XV.
The team now occupies the top of the ranking and becomes the only invincible team in the championship.
In the end, it is the superiority of their defense and the way they are seized of the opportunities that have allowed them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can welcome this match.
"To date, we have been tested. But we remain invincible, so I have to feel happy!" he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose congratulated Ayr: "Bravo to them, they were more effective than us and knew how to grasp the opportunities."
Grant Anderson's trial, at the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in good position, but a yellow cardboard for the Scottish Rory Hughes, released for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to talk the numbers. Jason Baggot took an untransformed trial.
Climo worsened the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the mid-time. He marked and transformed a solo trial to raise the score to 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
Melrose started well the second half-time and Patrick Anderson's trial, transformed by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
It followed a long wait because of a serious injury by Ruaridh Knott, who left the ground on a bay. At the recovery, Ayr resumed the fronts with a trial by Stafford McDowall transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, Acting Captain of Ayr, then received a yellow cardboard and, again, Melrose tried his chance with an untransformed test by Bruce Colvine, which created a palpable tension.
But the home team got back in hand, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to have Climo tapped while he didn't have the ball, since the touch of the penalty, MacPherson touched the back of the mouth of Ayr, which was progressing.
Climo has transformed the test, as almost every time since the recovery, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's kick box and sent the Gregor Henry ailer away for the fifth trial of the home team.
Still Game star launches in the restaurant
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, decided to make a career in the restaurant. The comedian was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man incarnates Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC show, which he writes and joins with his long-standing partner on stage, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the ninth series coming will be the final of the show, and Kiernan seems to be preparing for the post-Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although a source of Scottish Sun revealed Kiernan wanted to be involved in the "flowering environment of the restaurant" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, blocked, hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Marines are patroling in a armed boat in the La Paz Navy headquarters.
Public buildings have a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to Amazon, the naval bases show the following bike: "The sea returns to us from the right.
It's a duty to recover it."
Throughout the blocked Bolivia, the memory of a lost coast for Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is always well present. Just as the desire to navigate on the Pacific Ocean, once again.
These hopes have not been so palpable for decades, since Bolivia is waiting for a decision by the International Court of Justice, which will be issued on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
" Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course expects a positive outcome," explains Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screen throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Court will pronounce itself in favour of the Bolivian demand. Bolivia hopes that Chile, after decades of sporadic negotiations, will be obliged to negotiate the agreement of a sovereign transition to the Bolivian ocean.
Evo Morales, the native charismatic president of Bolivia (which faces a controversial fight for the reelection next year), also has a lot to say about the decision to be made on Monday.
"We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that there is little chance that the court will pronounce itself in favour of Chile, and that little would change, even if a positive decision was taken.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant Chilean territory, and stated that it would not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice makes its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case was "not complicated", explains Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from promoting Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have even damaged it.
"The problem of access to the sea has been diverted by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
The Belgian rhetoric of Morales undermined all the good Chilean will that remained, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that, it will be very complicated to hold talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in the Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision was abnormally rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will provide "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also contested the fact that Morales - which remains one of the most popular presidents of Latin America - used the maritime problem as a political bucket.
" Bolivia will never abandon its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The Court's decision is an opportunity to see that we must get rid of the past."
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will only take place when it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, said that his country would not deflect its nuclear weapons until he had confidence in Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to respect the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He spoke at the time when the United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to relaunch nuclear diplomacy in the impasse more than three months after the Singapore Summit with Kim Jong One, the current North Korean leader.
Ri declares that it is "chemical" to think that the continuation of the sanctions and the opposition of the United States to a declaration that will end the Korean war will fold the north.
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement in the absence of significant prior disarmament measures by Pyongyang.
Kim and the President of the United States Donald Trump want a second summit.
But the seriousness of Pyongyang regarding the abandonment of an arsenal that the country considers as the only guarantee of its security is debated.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month, in order to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion parades reveal the latest trends in cover managers, perhaps soon available in your shops
If you want to add XXL parts to your hat collection or protect yourself from the sun at 100%, don't look anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented their collections of crazy oversize hats during a PE19 parade that honored the style of the Fashion Week in Paris.
More and more extravagant hats than each other invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators decided to integrate their crazy pieces into the parades.
Valentino's lighthouse was an excentric beige hat decorated with a wide edge of a feather, which swallowed the head of the mannequins.
The other oversize accessories included pasteques with jewelry, a witch's hat and even an ananas. But these parts were not imagined to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most masks had cushioned lips and referred more to Hannibal Lecter than the Haute-Couture.
One creation looked like a diving equipment, with tuba and glasses, while another thought of a melted ice cone.
And if you follow fashion trends, then you have luck.
According to the style observers, the imposing hats could come to your shopping streets.
.The XXL hats follow the sleeve of the "Bomba", the straw hat on the wide board that the stars pull off, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that commercializes this hardly portable hat that flooded the social networks presented another of its lighthouse creations on the podium: a straw beach bag almost as large as the bathtress mannequin that wore it.
The burned orange rafia bag, decorated with rafia breezes and a handful of white leather, was the masterpiece of the PE19 parade The Riviera of Jacquemus at the Fashion Week of Paris.
The stylist of the celebrities Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see the great hats and beach bags arrive in the shops for next summer. The creator has so marked the spirits that it is obvious that there will be demand for oversize accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a dossier of school excellence. This trend continued in 2018 with new excellent review results reinforced by collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, the career they have chosen and their place as citizens of the world.
As a education sector capable of designing and implementing a sur-measurement school program, we find that contemporary languages remain popular and desirable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his tongue, you speak to his heart."
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to create relations and to establish a relationship of trust with people from other countries.
Looking at the excellent results of the examinations this year, it is noted that the languages are at the top of the ranking, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
In total, 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received the highest score, A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS school members show that 72 per cent of students received the highest score, A, mandarin, as well as 72 per cent of students who studied German, 69 per cent of students who studied French and 63 per cent of students who studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills for children and young people in the future.
Nowadays, languages as subjects are organized as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the programmes of independent schools and other schools.
A survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills conducted in 2014 shows that 17 per cent of employers' difficulties in recruiting candidates are related to insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more job opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in our globalized world.
Regardless of his career choice, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real advantage in the future through this sustainable competence.
Power to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically place the multilingual person in front of its competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults living in the United Kingdom, 75 per cent of them did not have a foreign language enough to hold a conversation. French was the only language spoken by a two-digit (15 per cent).
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
Speaking several languages, including those of emerging economies, children will have a better chance of finding a successful job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Several of them will focus on classic contemporary languages, while others will teach languages that are important to the United Kingdom in the context of 2020, including mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's preferences, several languages will be available in independent schools, with specialist staff in the field.
The Scottish independent schools want to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need for their success, no matter what the future reserves them.
It is clear that languages remain of crucial importance for the future of the country in a global trade environment, which must be reflected in education.
Modern languages must be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to the Scottish youth.
You have to do it.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will start with the Lakers Saturday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who watch LeBron James's beginnings at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, the coach of the Lakers, announced that James would play Sunday, in the opening of the pre-season, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we don't know how many minutes he'll play.
"More than one, less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a few limited minutes.
After the training, earlier in the week, James was asked for his projects for the pre-season program, which includes six games.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to be ready."
Trump Campaign in Western Virginia (Youtube Chain)
President Donald Trump started a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, Virginia-Occidental.
Other escalations are planned, particularly in states such as Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular.
With the postponement of the confirmation vote of the vacant position to the Supreme Court, Trump seeks to obtain support for the upcoming mid-mandate elections and prevent the Republicans from losing control of the Congress during the November vote.
What time is Trump's meeting in Western Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 (east time) tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump should address the question of the candidate's hearings at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, which took place this week. Kavanaugh's confirmation vote in the Senate should be postponed up to one week during the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings is primarily aimed at helping the Republicans gain ground for the November elections.
According to Reuters, the North American President stated in his campaign that the five meetings were intended to "promote volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives".
"Congress control is such an essential element of its program that the President will be visiting as many states as possible in this responsible election campaign," said Reuters, a spokesman of the Trump team, who refused to be appointed.
According to West Virginia Metro News, tonight's meeting, programmed at the Wesbanco Arena of Wheeling, could bring together supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of the media of Pittsburgh".
On Saturday, it will be the second visit in one month of Trump to Western Virginia, a state that he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the Virginia-Western Senate, who is behind the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to revive him in the polls," said Reuters, Simon Haeder, a political science specialist at the West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team is ready to fight to keep hope near the Sundays simple
After three simples, the Saturday afternoon ovens could well represent what was missing at this Ryder Cup.
The balancing movement of the pulse is an invented sports concept of all the pieces but to which players sincerely believe, and more than ever in tournaments like this.
So where would they find the momentum now?
"They were running with six points in advance and now four, so it gives us a little bit of wings," said Jordan Spieth while he went back for the day.
Europe has, of course, the advantage with four points of advance and twelve other points to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, have the feeling of having a bit of wind in puppet and have all the reasons to be encouraged, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and may be inclined to get each three points in four.
Spieth has proved terriblely effective from green tea and gives the example.
The energetic joy screams intensified as his game progressed. A crucial putt allowed him to equalize with the fourth part while Thomas and him were led down two after two holes.
His pussy, through which they won the game in the 15th hole, raised a similar cry from those who tell you that he still believes the American team.
"We really need to stay determined and focus on our game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left to each of these players now.
18 holes to demarcate.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as evidenced by the Ryder Cup history.
The strange but lovely European pair has won four of four games and has no right to error.
Not only were "Moliwood" the only ones who didn't realize a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped there on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy seems to circulate between them and the crowd is crazy, denouncing them as players to beat Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to enjoy a potential European victory while the sun is lying on the National Golf.
Preferably, both at the same time at different holes.
But talking about European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, a hero of the morning's furballs, while he was working together with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the first nine shots sent the Spanish and Swedish into a hole that they never could come out of.
On the other hand, no one is here to help you on Sunday.
The furballs and furs are so fascinating to observe closely because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give and those they don't give, and the way a strategy can turn into a glance.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has made considerable progress during the last day, but this furnaces session has also shown that the Americans have the courage to fight, which some, especially in the country, doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 at the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enjoy a strong advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup after having won it 10-6 on the United States at the Saturday furnaces and furnaces.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the task with two wins on a Tiger Woods in distress, allowing them to score four points so far.
Well decided to retain the title she had lost in Hazeltine two years ago, the European team of Thomas Bjorn made the difference by imposing 3-1 at the morning furballs, in the face of a disordered American team.
The United States has shown greater resistance in the furnaces and won two wins, but they have not succeeded in absorbing the gap.
Jim Furyk's men must definitely pick up eight points every 12 Sunday at the simple to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European recruit to pick up four points, while Molinari and him, named "Molliwood" after a frightening weekend, are only the second pair of Ryder Cup history to get four points in their first four matches.
After crashing Woods and Patrick Reed at the furnace balls, they beat the pair with flat sewing, consisting of the American beginner Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already tired by an even more categorical 5 and 4.
Woods, who slept during the two games of Saturday, shine a few times, but now he lost 19 of his 29 games in furballs and furnishes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, well rested for the morning furnaces, teamed with Henrik Stenson in the furnaces, winning the 2-1 victory against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively number one and three in the world ranking.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in the southwest of Paris, in a fresh but free time.
The three winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the reference for the Americans by marking two points on Saturday.
They won a well earned victory at 2-1 against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the furnaces and again beat Pulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the furnaces, those who lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the Ryder Cup history, a team recovered a four-point difference in single, although Furyk's team, who held the crown, had only to play zero to keep its trophies.
After having been second for two days, however, they may not recover from a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea said that disarmament could in no case be done unilaterally without confidence.
On Saturday, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs stated to the United Nations that the maintenance of sanctions would strengthen his mistrust against the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
At the annual General Assembly of the World Organization, Ri Yong Ho stated that last year North Korea had taken “important measures of goodwill”, such as the cessation of nuclear tests and missiles, the demantling of the nuclear testing site and its commitment to not proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we see no corresponding response from the United States," he regretted.
In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will fear our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to disarm ourselves unilaterally."
While repeating the well-known reproachs of North Korea regarding Washington's opposition to a "step-step" approach to denuclearization, which would reward North Korea if it took steps gradually, its statement proved important in that it did not reject the idea of unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump, held on 12 June in Singapore at the very first summit between a President-in-Office of the United States and a North Korean leader, when Kim committed to promoting "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea seeks to formally end the Korean war (1950-1953), but the United States stated that Pyongyang had to give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also refused requests to facilitate severe international sanctions against North Korea.
The United States insists that North Korea should first proceed to denuclearization and intensify pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve their goal in a coercive manner, even against "the declaration of the end of war".
"Those who think that these sanctions can make us be imposed do not know us.
The problem is that the maintenance of sanctions increases our mistrust."
Ri did not comment on the second summit between Kim and Trump highlighted by the American leader earlier this week before the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, and added: “If the party concerned with the issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such an impasse.”
Despite all this, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from that of last year, when he stated to the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to point the North Korean missiles into the North American territory after "malicious" President Trump called Kim "missile man" as a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened the United Nations last year to "completely destroy" North Korea, did not praise this year the courage with which Kim applied disarmament measures, but added that there was still much to do and that sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea was disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that no deadline had been set. "This can take two years, three years or five months; this is of no importance," he said.
China and Russia argue that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures adopted.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last Thursday to the United Nations Security Council that "The application of the Security Council sanctions must be maintained firmly and systematically until total, definitive and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to undermine the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri in the margins of the United Nations General Assembly and then announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
This year, Pompeo has already traveled three times to North Korea, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang, stating that progress had been made, but within the hours that followed, North Korea declared its "bandster methods".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed to dismantling a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took "equivalent measures".
According to the South Korean President, Kim demands the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and efforts to standardize relations with Washington.
Harvard: Students Take Rest Courses
This year, the Harvard University has launched a new course that allows all early-stage students to sleep more and fight the growing machist trend of studying by taking cafetine all night.
One teacher noticed that most students from the world's best university don't know how to take care of them.
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is, according to him, the first of the kind in the United States.
After giving a conference on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning, the idea came to him
At the end, a student approached me and said, "Why are they telling me this only in the last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he entrusted The Telegraph.
This course, for the first time this year, explains the need for students to adopt good sleeping habits to improve their school and physical performance, as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director General of University Health Services, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students were suffering from severe sleep shortages during the week.
The course time consists of different interactive exercises.
One of the sections shows the image of a dormitory containing different objects (coffee cups, curtains, baskets, books...) on which students click to know the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical performance and the importance of integrating a routine before bed.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep loss can increase the risk of heart attack, AVC, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change the behaviour of students.
However, in our opinion, they have the right to know this information - in the same way as you have the right to know the effects of smoking on health," said Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the culture of pride to spend "a white night" still exists, and he adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students make the lack of sleep a growing problem.
Having sufficient and good quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid taking weight, because the lack of sleep puts the brain in an inanition mode, making them hungry constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student in chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year in Harvard.
He argued that this course had opened his eyes and urged him to insist that he should be offered to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to propose to all students in the third cycle to follow a similar study program before joining the renowned institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students provide an alarm both for the time of bed and for the time of awakening, and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circular pace and cause sleep disorders.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal makes Gerrard's men fall
The Rangers suffered a new hard blow outside, the attack of Dolly Menga leading Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to Livingston to a 1-0 defeat.
Ibrox's team hoped to record his first victory in travel since his triumph 4-1 in St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games as a coach, leaving his team running, eight points behind the Hearts, leaders of the Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before mid-time and the Rangers team, short of inspiration, failed to match.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises in third position, just behind Hibernian on the difference of goals.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, since the arbitrator Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury following the throw of an object from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team, which beat Ayr in the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, as for him, chose the same Livi 11 who pulled a point at the Hearts last week and would have been pleased to see his well trained team suffocating his opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have mastered the possession of the ball, but Livingston has done more.
They should have marked at two minutes, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the field center missed his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then shot a powerful blow towards Captain Craig Halkett, but his team defender Alan Lithgow could only reach the second pole
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have been punished after the offensive attack when Steven Lawless and he came into collision, but the arbitrator Steven Thomson rejected Colombian requests.
The Rangers only took advantage of two shots in the first period, but the former guard of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was barely disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly and a hit by Ovie Ejaria.
If the opening of the score by Livi at the 34th minute was against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it by their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed to face Jacobs' arrest.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cold blood to choose Menga for an end in simplicity.
Gerrard reacted in the mid-term by replacing Coulibaly by Ryan Kent and the exchange was almost immediate when the wing came before Morelos, but the impressive Kelly hurried to block.
Livingston still continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett with long balls on long balls.
Holt's team could have taken advantage in the last few moments, but McGregor did well to push Jacobs back before Lithgow goes beyond the goal.
Glenn Middleton, who replaced the Rangers, again claimed a penalty at the end of the game while he was in jack with Jacobs, but Thomson ignored him again.
Almanach: The inventor of the Geiger meter
And now, a page of our Almanach "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE TOURNE COMPTENT... was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm " Hans" Geiger, Germany.
Geiger has developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity; an invention that subsequently gave birth to the device known as the Geiger meter.
Since then, the Geiger meter has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
A man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, it's used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
Thanks to these listeners, the effects of atoms released into minerals can be heard by radioactivity."
Evans: "Say, it's sure it jumps here!"
" Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains.
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "detecte" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "detecte" and kill cancer cells
In the course of treatment, the vaccine indicates to the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and transforming them into a laboratory
They can then "detecte" a protein that is common to many cancers, and then re-injected
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose purpose is to learn the immune system to recognize cancer cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient and transform them into a laboratory so that they can detect HER2 protein common to many cancers, and finally re-inject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the American National Institute for Cancer based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
According to Professor Berzofsky, HER2 protein "produces an increase in several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, pulmonary and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, consisting of taking immune cells to "learn" them to target cancer cells, has proved to be a treatment of a type of leukemia.
Haired with a MAGA cap, Kanye West started in a Pro-Trump diatribe after passing to the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West has been hugging on the plateau after an unchained performance during which he praised US President Donald Trump during a Saturday Night Live and announced that he will be presenting himself at the elections in 2020.
After his third song, Ghost Town, which he singed by wearing a Make America Great Again hat, West took away the democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times, I talk to white people and they say, "How can you love Trump? He's racist!"
"Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
The SNL program started with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star rids of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the record of West's diatribe was relayed on social media by the journalist Chris Rock.
We don't know if Rock was going to laugh at West with this publication.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour in the scenes because of his hat.
"They put pressure on me.
They told me not to come with that hat on my head.
They put pressure on me!
And after they say I'm in a whistle," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see him, the whistle?" and said he would wear his superman cap, because no one can dictate his actions to him. Do you want the world to progress?
Try love."
His comments attracted him hues at least twice from the public and the members of the SNL seemed embarrassed, reports Variety. A person on site said to the magazine: "A silence of death fell on the whole plateau."
West had been called to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West has distracted many people by singing the song I Love it in a Perrier bottle costume.
West received the support of the leader of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who published the following tweet: "To one of the most courageous spirits: MERCI TO TAKE TO THE FOULE."
But Karen Hunter, the director of the show, tweeted that West was simply "faithful to himself, and that it is absolutely wonderful."
"However, I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his art) who, in my opinion, adopts and casts a negative ideology for my community.
He's free.
And we too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow the tracks of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg wore the name of Snoop Lion and of course the legendary Prince fire, which changed his name into a symbol, then that of the artist previously known as Prince.
Belfast: Indictment of attempted murder after a white weapon aggression in a restaurant
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempting murder after a man was knotted last Friday in a restaurant east of Belfast.
According to the police, the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.

Prosecutors will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the star of the Game of Thrones series, takes to toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for its role as a fine blade, Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, the violent medieval series of HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor took off the macho hero's stereotype, saying that this kind of role on screen often leads young boys to be turned into hard cooking to be respected.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit stated that he said "something is wrong" and addressed the issue of toxic masculinity at the time of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, Game of Thrones' coveet, also 31 years old, confessed that he was holding " firmly" to address this issue.
"I personally think that we have misleaded masculinity."
"What teachings have we given to young men who become adults in relation to the problem that arises now?"
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very male characters.
He continued: "What behavior is innate, what behaviour has been inculcated?
What do TV and street learn from young boys who encourage them to think that they must behave like this to be a man?
I think that is really one of the fundamental questions of our time - how can we change this?
There is obviously something wrong."
In the interview, he also acknowledged that he would not make prologues or suites when the series will finish next summer, claiming that he had finished with "the battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will be the star of a recapture of True West, Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that the meeting with his wife Rose was for him the best thing that happened to him in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so she offered me my future family and life from now on," he says.
Rose interpreted Ygritte, Kit's lover, Jon Snow, in the fantastic series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, the family domain of Leslie.
HIV / Sida: China reports a 14 per cent increase in new cases
China reported an increase of 14 per cent in its population with HIV and AIDS.
According to the Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are affected.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported during the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the patients have been contaminated during sexual intercourse, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus spread rapidly in some regions of the country as a result of contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way was virtually zero, stated the Chinese health authorities at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
However, from year to year, the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-infected people in China increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, HIV transmission through sex is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was depenalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70 to 90 per cent of homosexual men finally marry a woman.
The number of cases of transmissions is due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to address this problem, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV medicines since 2003.
Maxine Waters argues that a GOP employee has disclosed Senators data, denouncing "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
On Saturday, U.S. Republican Maxine Waters declared that a member of his team had published personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages dedicated to legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat stated that these statements were supported by experts and "right-wing" websites.
"Liars, lies, and even infamous lies," Waters responded in a statement on Twitter.
It seems that the information disclosed included the addresses and telephone numbers of American senators. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information was made available on Thursday by an unknown person at Capitole Hill during the Senate meeting on allegations of sexual assault against the candidate at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicated that the IP address identifying the source of messages was associated with the Waters office and disclosed the information of a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, "this unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie."
"The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised due to these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for the leakage of this information."
"This fake allegation is completely false and a true lie."
The Waters statement prompted online criticism, including Ari Fleischer, the former White House Press Attorney.
"This denial is of anger," he wrote.
"This indicates that it does not have the temperament necessary to be a member of the Congress.
When a person is accused of something that she has not done, she must not be angry.
She shouldn't be provocative.
It must not challenge the reasons of the accused.
It must remain calm and quiet."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to democratic criticisms of Judge Kavanaugh, accused of being too angry at the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate at Waters headquarters in mid-mandat elections, also reported on Twitter.
"If that's true, it's huge," he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had alerted "the authorities and services responsible for implementing the laws concerned" about these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she added, "and that they are held responsible for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all members of my team."
Johnny English hit again. Rowan Atkinson's parodie, underdue spy
It has now become a tradition to look for the scope of Brexit in any new British film, and this seems to apply to this resume of the Johnny English action comedy, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
Will the ironic self-satire on the question of the evidence of our insignificance represent the new chance of our country's export?
In all cases, the incompetent Johnny English, with the eyes scratched and in the face of rubber, saw his second licence renewed in a confused context - this name indicating first and foremost that it is a great comic creation designed for a non-anglophone film audience.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his doubtful attempts of glamorous charm, has a little Clouseau, a suspicion of Mr. Bean and a good dose of the guy who executes a small note in the Fire Chariots at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
Originally, he was also inspired by the traveler and the international mystery man that Atkinson once played in the TV advertising Barclaycard, now forgotten, leaving chaos behind him.
The last Johnny English has one or two friendly moments.
I liked Johnny English approaching a helicopter while he was wearing a medieval armor and the rotor pales hit his helmet briefly.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is highlighted, although humor is rather inadequate and strangely superfluous, especially at the time when "serious" licenses such as 007 and Mission impossible form themselves in confidence with the comedy.
The humor seems more focused on children than on adults and, for me, Johnny English's misaventures are less creative and more targeted than Atkinson's silent film gags in Bean's character.
The permanent presumption is that Britain has serious problems.
A computer pirate infiltrated the super secret web network of British spies, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the great distraction of the agents in service - a poor role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the drop that makes the vase clear for a Prime Minister who is a pumpy character at the edge of the crisis and who already suffers from political impopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this almost Teresa-May character, but there is not much to get under the tooth in the scenario.
Her intelligence advisers inform that every active spy has been compromised, she will have to bring someone out of her retirement.
This means that you need to disrupt Johnny English himself, who is now employed in a chic institution as a school master, but who secretly teaches how to become a secret agent: a few beautiful fakes here, because English offers a Rock Academy of Spying.
English is returned to Whitehall for an emergency information meeting and finds Bough, his former long breathing partner, again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey stick role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So, Batman and Robin, who create great trouble with His Majesty's secret services, return to action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the seizure of the technology charismatic billionaire who says he is able to solve the computer problems in Britain: the disastrous Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough are launching their odyssies of silly jokes: under the dress of servers, they fire a French restaurant that shines; they create chaos by whispering on the luxurious sailing of Volta; and English triggers a real anarchy when he tries, with a virtual reality helmet, to familiarize himself with the interior of the Volta house.
All stops are secured for this last sequence, but after all, there's a lot of things for the kids in all this.
A rather moderate film.
I couldn't stop thinking, like for the other films of Johnny English: can't the British cinematographic industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really value his talent?
The Labour Party denies having developed a plan to allow the British to work for four days but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must consider a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week - but to be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants the heads of business to benefit workers from the savings generated by artificial intelligence (IA) by giving them an additional day of leave.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend while continuing to receive the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would be consistent with the party's economic program and plans to guide the country towards workers.
The transition to a four-day week was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a means for workers to benefit from economic changes.
An important source within the Labour Party stated in the Sunday Times: "It is planned that a policy review should be announced before the end of the year."
"This will not happen in one night, but a four-day working week is a goal that goes hand in hand with the party's approach to rebalance the economy for workers as well as with its overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, since the Green Party committed itself to a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesman of the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not a party policy and is not considered by it."
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week's Labour Conference to give details of his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell expressed his determination to take over the power of "anonymous administrators" and "profits" in public utility companies.
The alternate chancellor's plans also provide that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover their entire stake as the Labour Government could make "deductions" due to alleged differences in conduct.
It also confirmed its worker integration plan in corporate boards and the creation of an inclusive shareholder fund that will pay 10 per cent of private companies' capital to employees, which will collect up to £500 dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy trust "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could make them change their minds.
The final vote on the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court was postponed by at least one week following the FBI investigation of the charges against him and raised the question whether the findings of the Office could encourage Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, Scott Pelley, the 60 Minutes program correspondent, asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"When I went to the hearing, I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, determined, unambiguous."
However, Graham's vote seems engraved in the stone.
"I made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and there would be an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett categorically denied it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people that she appoints couldn't check it.
It's a 36-year-old case.
I do not notice anything new that changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did it do something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a very impressive palmares of stars and invested in an equally impressive mission: to put an end to poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now at its seventh edition, will see dozens of thousands of people coming to Central Park's Great Lawn in order not only to benefit from the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the festival, namely to put an end to extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, the first edition of which took place in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international defence group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you are ready to pay a VIP ticket), viewers had to carry out a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, emailing a global leader, telephoneing or making any other useful effort to raise awareness of the population of poverty.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen organization still achieve its goal in the remaining 12 years?
Does the idea of rewarding people through a free concert really convince them to call for action, or is it just another example of "clictivism" - a situation in which people really think to make the difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, who advocate many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have contributed to encouraging global leaders to make commitments and to adopt policies of more than $37 billion that are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its shares, of which a tranche of at least $10 billion has already been paid out or revoked.
The group estimates that the funds guaranteed have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Among the main commitments is The Power of Nutrition, a UK partnership of investors and executors who have committed themselves to "help children develop their full potential," while promising to Rwanda a support of GBP 35 million to end malnutrition in that country after receiving more than 4,700 messages from Global Citizens.
"Thanks to the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make social injustice of nutrition a footnote in history," said Tracey Ullman, ambassador of the The Power of Nutrition program at a concert held in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, following the company's over 5,000 actions aimed at requesting the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children in the context of nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on his website, "What makes you think that it is possible to put an end to extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said, "The way to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and we will fail.
However, as the great movements in the defence of civil rights and in the fight against apartheid before us, we will be able to do so, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will be presenting this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will live the show.
The United States could use the Navy to create a "block" to prevent Russian energy exports - Secretary for the Interior
In order to prevent Russian energy from entering the markets, including the Middle East, Washington can "if necessary" appeal to the American Navy," Ryan Zinke, the American Secretary for the Interior, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke stated that Russia's presence in Syria - particularly where it operates at the request of the legitimate government - is a pretext that allows it to explore new energy markets.
"I think they are in the Middle East in order to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern centre of Europe," he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy this.
"The United States can, together with our Navy, ensure that seaways are open and, if necessary, obstruct to ensure that their energy is not placed on the market," he added.
Zinke spoke to the participants in the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that defines itself as the "speaker of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they are in reality identical.
"With regard to Iran and Russia, the economic option lies more or less in the exploitation and replacement of fuels," he said, while referring to Russia, saying that it has "more than one string to its arc" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
These statements arrive at a time when Trump's administration has committed itself to stimulating the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe by replacing Russia, a much less expensive solution for European consumers.
To do so, Trump's representatives, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to get out of the "inappropriate" project of the North Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, makes the city of Berlin "prisoner" of Moscow.
On several occasions, Moscow stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline, worth 11 billion dollars, which is expected to double the current capacity to reach 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
In a speech delivered in September in Moscow following a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Secretary for Energy, the Russian Minister for Energy Alexandre Novak said "I believe that we share this view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers."
The United States' position has led to negative reactions from Germany, which reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
The main German industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States not to be involved in European energy policy or in bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a huge problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Poutine.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider the possibility of attending the presidential elections in 2020, says the senator of Massachusetts
The Senator of the Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would seriously consider the possibility of attending the presidential elections following the mid-mandat elections.
At a public assembly in Holyoke, in the Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would be thinking of presenting herself.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and for that, a woman will have to be at the top," she says, "The Hill.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider submitting my application to the presidential officers."
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public gathering, stating that he "drive this country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and of the candidate to the Supreme Court of Trump, Brett Kavanaugh.
Friday, in a message on Twitter, Warren said, "Of course, we need an investigation from the FBI before we vote."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's voters are not of the opinion that it should appear in 2020.
According to the poll of the Political Research Centre of the University of Suffolk and the Boston Globe, 58 per cent of the "probable" voters of Massachusetts stated that the senator should not be present.
32 per cent were in favour of such a campaign.
The survey revealed that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supported, with 38 per cent in favour of a potential campaign and 48 per cent against it.
Among the other names of democrats that were very much mentioned for a potential campaign in 2020 are those of former Vice-President Joe Biden and the Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden stated that he would take an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin PTSD during Donald Trump’s gathering
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after his recruitment in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and accused of a domestic violence incident.
"What my own son now experiences, what he feels when he comes home, I can link him to other families who feel the consequences of the PTSD and some injuries with which our soldiers return," she said to the public at the Donald Trump meeting in Tulsa, in Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as a "tabulous subject" and said about his son and other veterans that "they come back a little different, endured, wondering if they respect what their comrades and members of the air forces, and every other military, have given to the country."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman from Wasilla police, he was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of adult violence and aggression against a woman, which interferes with a relationship of marital violence and possession of a weapon in a state of bride.
18 States and Columbia District are in favour of a judicial contest of the new asylum policy
18 States and the Columbia District are in favour of a judicial contest of the new US policy that refuses asylum for victims who escape a gang or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives of the 18 States and districts filed a memorandum in favour of an asylum seekers who contested this policy, NBC News said.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said that her partner "and her sons, members of violent gangs," had attacked her, but the US authorities decided to reject her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generated a large number of applications for asylum in the United States, as countries facing widespread problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new American asylum policy annulled a decision made in 2014 by the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed illegal immigrants who escaped marital violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, the District Attorney General of Columbia, stated on Friday in a statement that the new policy "notifies decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal law stipulates that all asylum applications must be examined on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle," said the amicus curiae in his memory.
Lawyers also supported the fact that the policy of refusal to enter immigrants undermines the US economy, supporting that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "to provide the necessary work".
In June, the Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims who flee domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asile is granted to persons who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, belief, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political beliefs," said Sessions on 11 June, in its announcement of that policy.
"Asile has never been designed to alleviate all the problems -- even the most serious -- that people meet every day around the world."
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of double deaths in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly dramatic.
"I feel very excited," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old family mother, comforting her little fibrous boy in Palu, in an empty city evacuation centre.
"Every moment, an ambulance brings back the bodies.
Clean water is rare."
Residents were seen going to their destroyed homes, collecting bad goods and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 size earthquake have been submerged.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a fracture of the back and shoulders, rested in front of the Palu military hospital, where patients were treated outside because of persistent replications.
The tears filled his eyes when he told him how he felt the violent earthquake that shake the hotel room on the fifth floor where he lived with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the ruins of the wall, I think," said Haris to Associated Press, stating that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but after silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
The ambassador of the United States accuses China of "intimidation" by means of "propaganda advertising"
One week after a Chinese official newspaper made a four-page advertising of the mutual advantages of trade between the United States and China in an American newspaper, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to disseminate propaganda.
US President Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday the supplement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the most sold newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US parliamentary elections of November 6, an accusation that China rejects.
In accusing Beijing of wanting to enter the US elections, Trump marked what American officials said to Reuters to be a new phase in a growing campaign conducted by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in an increasing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs to their imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China's tariff measures were aimed at hitting exporters of states such as Iowa who supported the Republican Trump Party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, ambassador of the United States in China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an opinion article published in the Sunday Des Moines Register, "is doubling its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press."
"In the dissemination of its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by placing a pay-per-view in the Des Moines Register," Branstad writes.
"On the other hand, at the Beijing press shop you will find little controversial voices and will not see the true reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese can have on the worrying economic path of China, because the media are firmly obeying the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers has avoided publishing" his article, without saying which newspaper.
Analysts warn that the Republicans have led the voters to the mid-mandate elections as a result of Kavanaugh's debut.
While many high-ranking Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court in a context of allegations of sexual aggression, the analysts advised that a negative reaction, especially among women, could occur during the next mid-term elections.
The feelings surrounding this matter have been extremely vigorous, and most Republicans have already shown publicly that they wanted the vote to take place.
In an article published on September 29 in The Hill, Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Sciences at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse said "we can't go back".
Reeher added that he doubted that the last minute efforts made by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in favour of an FBI investigation would be sufficient to calm the anger of voters.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, head and national spokesman of the Progressive Group MoveOn, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November," she said last September 28, according to the Washington newspaper.
Friday morning, Mic reports, protesters sang "The month of November arrives!" in the Senate corridor, while the Republicans governing the Judicial Committee chose to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be dismayed," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
"The people say it's already high, it's true.
But this could be even higher, especially among the electors of the suburbs and young electors aged 18 to 29 who, even if they don't like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public statement explaining in detail the allegations of sexual aggression against the Supreme Court's nominee, analysts made the impression that the reaction might be vivid if the Republicans advance the confirmation.
According to NBC News, the former president of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, said at the beginning of last week that "it became a confused disorder for the GOP".
"This is not only the vote of the committee or the final vote, but also the appointment of Kavanaugh. It is also the way the Republicans managed the situation and the way they treated it," said Guy Cecil, Director of the United States Priorities, a group assisting elected democrats in the television newspaper.
However, following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, the Americans seem to be divided about the credibility of the two parties, a small majority on the side of the latter.
A new YouGov survey revealed that 41 per cent of the people consulted believed absolutely or probably in Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent said they believed absolutely or probably Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 per cent stated that Kavanaugh probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30 per cent claimed the same thing about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI investigates the allegations made by Ford and at least one other accused, Deborah Ramirez, after the pressure of Senator Flake.
Ford swore last week before the Senate Judicial Committee that she had been attacked by Kavanaugh while he was in a condition of bride at the age of 17 years.
Ramirez claims that when they studied in Yale in the 1980s, the candidate for the Supreme Court would have shown him his genital parties during a party.
The World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a brand new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The very latest project of the technological legend, Inruptt, is a company that benefits from the free Solid platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored as well as persons allowed to access such information.
In an exclusive interview awarded to Fast Company, Berners-Lee said by joking that Inrupt was intended to "do dominate the world".
"We must do it now," he said about the launch.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "on-line personal data store" or DPL.
It may contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a musical library, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time on a single browser.
The particular feature of the online personal data store is that it is entirely the user's responsibility to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls this "personal responsibility through data".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is that the company provides appropriate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few contract developers working on the project and a voluntary coder community.
As of this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that his team and his team are not yet in discussion with " Facebook and Google" so that we can find out whether to make a complete change where all their business models are completely swamped in a moment.
"We don't ask for permission."
In an article published on Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee writes that "the mission [of Inrupt] is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid".
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Although he launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new web era," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebrating a clergyman of the First World War decorated by the Victoria Cross
The only clergyman of the Church of England who received the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter was celebrated in his native city 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on September 29, 1918, during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by an elite shooter four days later and was not aware that he had obtained the highest British military distinction.
His two granddaughters revealed a commemorative stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, last Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his granddaughters, said that it was "brightly symbolic" to reveal the stone exactly 100 years after the exploitation of his grandfather.
According to the London Gazatte, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on the canal of Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under the violent shooting of campaign canons and guns."
Later, he hurried on the shooting line and, with the "greater brave", guided the line before blowing up a campaign canon on his own and drove three soldiers from the detachment.
On 4 October 1918, a German elite shooter killed Lieutenant Colonel Vann, a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said that his grandfather's actions were "one thing that I will never be, but which makes me humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann confided that he felt "very honored to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of an authentic hero is reflected in the support that will be given to him by many people."
Mixed martial art fans stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they had Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you spent the night watching a Bellator 206 well filled, but you couldn't see the main event.
In San José, the event had 13 fights, including six on the main record, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the United Kingdom, on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight, the United Kingdom's viewers were stuck when the broadcast changed for Peppa Pig.
Some were discontented to have stayed awake until the early hours of the morning especially for the fight.
A supporter on Twitter described the passage to the cartoon for children as "a kind of bad joke".
With regard to the transmission, the Chief Vice President of Marketing and Communications at Bellator, Dave Schwartz, said that "the government regulation provides that at 6 a.m. this content was not adapted, so they had to switch to children's programs."
"Peppa the pig", yes.
Scott Coker, the president of the Bellator company, said they were going to work on their programming to include British viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about recasting, I think we can probably find a solution," Coker said.
"However, it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday and we won't be able to find a solution until Sunday our hour, or Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, there were many messages in both directions and they were not all friendly.
We tried to fix, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a problem, it was a government issue.
I can assure you it won't happen next time.
We will be limited to five fights instead of six - as we do usual - and we have tried to give more for fans and we have ruined everything.
This is a regrettable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" in terms of sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley claims to have grown up by feeling lower than others because of his sexuality - but this has induced him to succeed.
The 24-year-old man said he didn't realize before he went to high school that "all weren't like me."
As part of the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs program presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken about the issue of homosexual rights to give others hope.
He also said that becoming a parent had made him less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
The usual presenter of the program, Kirsty Young, took several months' leave because of her illness.
Appeared as a nude in Laverne's first show, Daley entrusted that he felt "less than" all other children growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said, "Today again, these feelings of being lower and different are the real things that have given me the power and strength necessary for my success."
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about his sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was "something," he prosecuted.
The double Olympic Bronze Medal is now a renowned LGBT activist and has benefited from his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to ask more countries to describe homosexuality.
He said that he was speaking because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and thus wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world's three-year-old champion said he was not expecting to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Daley married last year the Oscar winner, 20 years old, but he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you see so many things at such a young age" - he participated in his first 14-year-old Olympic Games and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find a person of the same age who had experienced the same high and low.
In June, they became parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his perspective" had changed.
"If you had questioned me last year, I was just thinking of winning a gold medal," he says.
"You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 following a brain cancer.
Daley confided that his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was whether they had their tickets already for London 2012, because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't say to him, "Pappa, you won't be here anymore to be in the first row," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and it took him to stop breathing and he was dead so that I finally realized that he was not invincible," he added.
Next year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"That was all I had dreamed of all my life - dive in front of a crowd at home at the Olympic Games, there is nothing better," he said.
In addition, this inspired him to his first choice of song - Heather Small's Proud - who had accompanied him during the preparations for the Olympics and always gave him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11.15, BST.
A fit Mickelson on the Ryder Cup bank Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will make a record this Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to get back up to avoid it being a unfortunate step.
Mickelson, who participated in the biannual competition for the twelfth time, a record, was dismissed by Captain Jim Furyk from Saturday's furballs and fursomes.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as it has been so often for the United States, the five-thousand great champion shared his day between the role of supporting and finishing his game at the stand in order to remedy his pains.
He has never been the greatest leader, even at the top of his career. At 48, he is not the most suitable for the difficult National Golf, where the long rough systematically punishes the lost shots.
And as if the race was not frightening enough in itself, Mickelson, at the ninth Sunday game, confronts Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who made a team this week with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four games.
If the Americans, at four down at the beginning of the 12 single games, take a good start, Mickelson's game could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his husband, but he couldn't say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had to play today, gave me a tape in the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has great confidence in him.
He is a legendary champion and he has added so much to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I wasn't planning, but that's how it happened, and that's how we think it's going to be.
He wants to be there, like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Fado's record of the largest number of Ryder Cup meetings.
This could mark the end of a career at the Ryder Cup that has never reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson's active 18 victorys, 20 defeats and seven demo, although Furyk stated that his presence brought concrete elements to the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he loves to laugh at people, and he's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had a pleasure in measuring themselves to him this week, which was fun to see.
It's a lot more than playing."
The captain of the European selection Thomas Bjorn knows that the advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that a significant advance before the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a painful course.
The Danes disputed their first match in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team whose captain was Seve Ballesteros had five advance points on the Americans, but finally lifted himself to the top of the ranking with the smallest possible difference on the finish line, taking it 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You don't stop remembering that we were leading widely to Valderrama; we had a big advance in Brookline, where we failed, as well as in Valderrama, where we won, but just," said Bjorn, after watching the 2018 Ranking to win the 5-3 victory both Friday and yesterday at the National Golf to lead 10-6.
History will prove to me and all members of this team that this is not the end.
Go deep tomorrow.
Go ahead and do whatever you need.
It's not over until you have the points on the table.
We have a goal, to try to win this trophy, and that is what we need to be focused on.
I have always said to focus on the 12 players in our camp, but we are very aware of what is happening on the other side - they are the best players in the world."
Enjoying the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never make progress on this point.
Tomorrow, it's another pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow, it will be the individual performance that will be presented and it will be quite different.
It's fantastic to be with a teammate when things are all right, but when you're there in loneliness, you're tested up to your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message to send to players, it is to draw the best from yourself tomorrow.
When you leave your partner behind, he must take the best from himself, too."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to make sure that his players get better results individually than as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who obtained three points in four.
Furyk himself experienced the two ends of the last day's revivals, after being part of the winning team in Brookline before losing the end of the "Miracle de Medina", where Europe removed the victory.
"I remember every word," he explained in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, had done to bring his players together the last day.
"We have 12 important meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take this quick start as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
This dynamic, when it goes in one direction, puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We established our training accordingly and put the guys as we thought to do, we try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of conducting the counter-attack and will confront Rory McIlroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the highest half of the ranking.
"I accompanied this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the entire course," Bjorn said on his selections in simple.
Germany's new warship yet postponed
According to the local media, the new German Navy Fregate should have been launched in 2014 to replace the ageing warships dating from the cold war, but it will not be in service until at least next year due to defective systems and exponential expenditures.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman, the use of the "Rhinland-Palatinate", the amiral ship of all the new Bade-Wurtemberg Fregates, was postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship should have included the Navy in 2014, but the worrying problems that occurred after delivery have compromised the destiny of this ambitious project.
The four ships of the Bade-Wurtemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the Bremen-class ageing fregates.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful canon, a range of anti-air and anti-marine missiles, as well as certain furtive technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the most recent fregates for a period of up to two years outside the attachment ports.
According to Die Zeit, however, the incessant delays mean that pre-war ships - which should allow Germany to project its overseas force - will already be obsolete when they are in service.
Last year, the cursed F125 Fregate made the big titles when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship in service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to a shipowner after delivery.
The reasons for this return were little known, but the German media mentioned a number of "software and hardware defects" that made the warship unnecessary in the event of deployment in a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important because the Bade-Wurtemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of approximately 120 marinas, which represents half of the crews of the old Bremen class fregates.
In addition, it appears that the ship is significantly overloaded, which reduces its performance and reduces the Navy's capacity to make future improvements.
It is estimated that the "Rhineland-Palatinate" of 7,000 tons weighs twice as heavy as similar class ships used by Germans during World War II.
In addition to the failures of the computer system, the overall cost of the project, including the training of the crew, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that it reached the astronomical sum of €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), compared with €2.2 billion at the beginning.
The problems related to new fregates are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval force is decreasing.
Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, recognized earlier this year that the Navy is in fact “in fact short of ships capable of deploying”.
The manager stated that the situation had produced a snowball effect over time, since the old ships were dismantled, but no replacement ships were designated.
He regretted that none of the Bade-Wurtemberg Fregates could join the Navy.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of the flea
New research carried out in a Scottish Highlands area seeks to reveal how the fladdermeat uses the landscape in their quest for food.
It is hoped that the observations will give new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will guide future conservation activities.
The study of researchers from the National Trust for Scotland will follow communal and soprano pipistrils as well as long-hearing brown flaps and Daubenton in the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor the activities of the lobsters throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using portable detectors.
A professional sound analysis will determine the frequency of screams of flaps and the activities of different species.
A map and a report on habitat will be prepared to draw up a detailed picture of their behaviour across the territory.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important habitat areas for salmon lobsters and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will identify the benefits of Habitat Management work such as the creation of grassland and the best way to preserve forests for flax and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the population of bats has declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects the perchyards and causes the loss of their habitat.
Winds and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as kill-foot paper and some chemical treatments of construction materials, as well as the attacks of company cats.
Flowers aren't really blind.
However, given their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation technique to identify insects and obstacles on their flight route.
In charge of the protection of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 large gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes the flax very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts, who regularly carry out surveys, pearl inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization has also established the first and only stock of Scottish bats on the Threave site in Dumfries-and-Galloway, which comprises eight of the ten Scottish bats.
David Thompson, domain manager, claims that the site is the ideal territory for them.
"Here, at Threave, we have an ideal place for the flea," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all the good habitat.
But there is still a lot to learn about fladdermeat, so the work we do here and in other places will help us to understand better what fladdermeat needs to prosper."
He stressed the importance of verifying the presence of fladdermeat before maintaining the properties, because by destroying it without a desire, a single maternity nest could cause the death of 400 females and young people, or even the disappearance of a whole local population.
Flowers are protected and it is illegal to kill them, to disrupt them, or to destroy their pearls.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish Director of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to provide her assistance.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our flax and, as far as many of our species are concerned, we do not know what is happening in their populations at the moment."
Ronaldo refutes the charges of rape while his lawyers are preparing to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the accusations of rape against him as "false information," and stated that people "will become acquainted" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to prosecute the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of violating an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He would then have paid her $375,000 to keep her quiet about this incident, said Der Spiegel last Friday.
By addressing his 142 million fans in a live video on Instagram, a few hours after the release of the allegations, Ronaldo, 33 years old, described this information as "false information".
“No, no, no, and no.
What they said today is false information," said to the camera the five-fold winner of the Golden Ballon.
"They want to make a pub using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything's fine," added the player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are about to prosecute Der Spiegel about these allegations, which they described as "inadmissible disclosure of suspicions in the field of privacy".
Advocate Christian Schertz stated that the player would claim compensation for "moral damages proportional to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of the human rights of the person in recent years".
The alleged incident would have taken place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player's room, where an anal rape would have occurred, according to documents filed with Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went on his knees after the suspected incident and assured him to be a "good guy" at "99%", but he did not know what was going on with the remaining "1%".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual relations, but that they were agreed.
Mayorga also claimed that she had returned to the police and that photos of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she had subsequently accepted a friendly settlement because she felt "fraid by reprisals" and feared "to suffer public humiliation."
This 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to cancel this regulation because she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid leaving Manchester United at the time of this alleged aggression, and this summer he joined the Italian giant Juve under a contract of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would "be afraid forever" of the departure of car manufacturers.
According to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Trade, the United Kingdom would "be sorry for it forever" if it had lost its position as world leader in automotive construction after Brexit.
He added that it was “unsettling” that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production in its Burnaston factory, near Derby, if Britain would withdraw from the EU without agreement.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer indicated that the impact of delays at the border in the event of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory - which manufactures Auris and Avensis vehicles in Toyota - built nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other EU countries.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, the production will stop in our factory," said Toyota Director Marvin Cooke in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their fear of leaving the EU without agreement on the operation of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW indicates that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month following the Brexit.
The main concerns concern about what car manufacturers qualify as risks for the supply chain in the case of Brexit without agreement.
The Toyota production line is operated in "tended flow", parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for vehicles manufactured on-order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the border which, according to industry, could lead to delays and shortages of coins.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep the inventory more than one day at its Derbyshire factory, declared the company, and thus production would be discontinued.
According to Clark, Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated in order to avoid such border controls".
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that will, as I said, not only benefit from the current success, but also take advantage of this opportunity," he said in the Radio 4's Today BBC.
"Evidence, not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers, is that we must be absolutely able to maintain what has proved to be an excellent set of supply chains."
However, if Toyota was unable to clarify how long the production would be stopped, it warned that in the longer term, additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the unit union coordinator at the factory, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs disappear, they never return."
A government spokesman said, "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
The White House announces that the Trump and Rosenstein meeting could still be delayed
According to the announcement made on Sunday by the White House, the meeting, which presents important challenges, between Donald Trump and Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein could be "rejected by one week", while the struggle for the candidate at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Robert Mueller, the Special Adviser to Investigate Russian Intrusion in Elections, the links between Trump's and Russia's staff and the possible obstacles to justice by the President.
The question of whether or not Trump will send the Deputy Attorney General, and thus jeopardize Mueller's independence, has been feeding rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
However, last Monday he presented himself at the White House, while he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which then was in the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump stated that he would "do not prefer" to resign Mr. Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a confrontation with the hearing of the Senate Judicial Commission before which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual aggression, witnessed.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of complaints against Kavanaugh, delaying the Senate vote.
Sunday, Trump's press attack, Sarah Sanders, made a show at Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "No date has been set for this, it could be this week, I could see if we can revoke another week, given all the other things that are happening at the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I like to keep the press informed."
The claim would be contested by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has not held any press conferences in the White House.
The director Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the rareness of the conferences was not due to aversion for the "demagogical" television reporters, although she said, "I have nothing against the fact that they are sweeping the gallery."
Then she made it clear that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
Without citing evidence, she added that "the president participates in more questions-answer sessions than any other president before him": "We checked the numbers."
Press conferences will always take place, said Sanders, "but if the press has the chance to question the President of the United States directly, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We are trying to do so frequently, you have seen it well in recent weeks, and this will take the place of a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he takes part in public meetings or press conferences with worthy officers.
It is rare that there are solo press conferences.
This week, in New York, the President may have shown why, by making a relaxed appearance and at times a strange appearance before the journalists gathered.
Concerning concerns about Brexit, the Health Secretary wrote to EU workers at NHS Scotland
The Secretary for Health wrote to EU officials working within the Scottish NHS to express their country's gratitude and wish them to remain in post post after Brexit.
The Scottish parliamentarian Jeane Freeman sent a letter within six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the cost of applications for status for European citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "In the summer, negotiations on withdrawal continued between the United Kingdom and the EU and are expected to lead to decisions this fall.
However, the British Government has also intensified its preparations in the event of no agreement.
I understand that this period must be very worrying for each of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate my appreciation for the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Colleges from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that consolidate and improve the work of health services and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here."
After having suffered head injury, Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery
Sselon Mike Organ, from the Tennessee State, Christion Abercrombie, the supporter of the Tennessee Tigers, was operated urgently after a head injury on Saturday during the defeat of Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27.
Rod Reed, the chief coach of the state of Tennessee, told the journalists that the injury had occurred just before mid-term.
"He arrived on the touch line and collapsed there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff administered oxygen in Abercrombie on the touch line before placing it on a cockpit and taking it through another examination.
A state representative of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center's operating room.
Harris explained that there were "no details yet on the type or extent of the injury," and that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an athlete in the second year, is in his first season with the state of Tennessee after his transfer of the Illinois.
He had a total of five pitches on Saturday before leaving the game, which brought his total of the season to 18 pitches.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp rights if they purchase property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp rights if they buy a property in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help homeless people under new conservative regimes
This measure will cancel the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to collect up to 120 million pounds Sterling per year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp tariff if they buy a property in the United Kingdom - the additional money will be used to help homeless people, says Theresa May today.
This will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by undertaking to provide more affordable housing and target people with high incomes.
Increased stamp rights will be imposed on individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to strengthen government efforts to help homeless people.
This surtax - which adds to the current stamp right, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on secondary residences and rental purchases - could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to collect up to 120 million pounds Sterling per year.
About 13% of new London constructions are purchased by non-residents of the United Kingdom, which increases prices and prevents the first-admissibles from making themselves a place in the housing market.
Many rich areas in the country - especially in the capital - have become "spiritual cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who most of the time stay outside the country.
This new policy occurs just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp rights to help more young people acquire a first home.
Accusing large building companies to maintain high real estate prices by adding land without using it, he invited Ms. May to renounce affordable housing quotas in order to settle the UK's "immobilial disbursement".
Mr. Corbyn presented an attractive series of proposals for reform in the housing sector, including the control of rents and the abolition of "unintelligent" expulsions.
He also wished to give counsellors broader powers to build new housing.
Ms. May said, "I said last year that I would dedicate my position as Prime Minister to the rebirth of the British dream - that every new generation would have a better life.
To do so, we need to repair our broken housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to all those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair that it is as easy for individuals who do not reside in the United Kingdom as well as for foreign companies to buy a home as for British residents who work hard.
For many too many people, the dream of access to property has become remote and the poverty of homeless people remains too real."
Jack Ross: My final ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland technician Jack Ross explains that his "ultimate ambition" is to become the Scottish selector at a given time.
The 42-year-old Schottian is pleased to meet the challenge of re-establishing the North-East club, which currently occupies the third place of the League 1, at three points of the leader.
He joined the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren to the Scottish First League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for Division B and that's all," Ross said at the Sportsound of BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up following Scottish games in Hampden with my father and that's one thing I've never forgotten.
This opportunity would, on the other hand, only be present if I succeeded in the leadership of the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's selectors are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic technician said he did not hesitate to stand behind such emblematic names in such a big club, having already rejected the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the success of the moment will be measured in the light of the question "can I bring this club back to the Premier League?"
From the structure and infrastructure of this club, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he added.
"It's not easy to do so, but I'd probably only think I'd be a success here if I managed to bring the club back there."
Ross has only three years of career as a coach, after a period as an assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts coaches.
He then helped Alloa to rise from a third division relegation and turned St Mirren, who was on the edge of the relegation, to a great winner of the championship the following season.
Ross is more comfortable now than during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
The management of Alloa "probably was a real crossroads," he remembers.
"I really thought that being a coach would be better than playing.
It sounds strange because I got out well, I earned my life well and I enjoyed some great peaks.
But sometimes playing is hard.
There's a lot of details to settle every week.
I continue to live this in terms of stress and stress at work, but being a coach is very good for me.
I have always wanted to lead and now I do, I feel more comfortable in my skin than I have been in my whole adult life."

The figures indicate that bar and pub groups recorded a 2.7 per cent increase in sales in July, but revenues in restaurants decreased by 4.8 .
Peter Martin from the CGA Consultative Office, which compiled the data, said: "The permanent sunlight and the longer than planned participation from England in the World Cup made July follow the June model, where the bars had experienced an increase of 2.8%, except for restaurants, who suffered even more shock.
The decline of 1.8% in the restaurant sector recorded in June only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars where alcoholic drinks are served are far from the most in vogue, with more points of resemblance than the restaurants that fall.
Food pubs have also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as restorers.
Looks like people just want to go out and have a drink.
In pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6% over the month and food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, a specialist in leisure and hotel business, said: "These results follow the trend since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors in sales on the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that catering groups continue to experience difficulties, although a decrease in sales by an average of 4.8 per cent per year is particularly painful, in addition to continuing cost pressure.
The long and hot summer could not have been less appropriate for food industry operators and time will tell us whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will give a well-deserved respite."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in implantation.
The sales of the industry are monitored by the Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK advertising, bars and restaurants sector, which collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than £9 billion Sterling and represents the standard in the established industry.
On social media, one in five children has secret accounts he hides from his parents
According to a survey, a five-year-old - some of whom are only 11 - has secret accounts on social media that he hides to his parents and teachers.
A survey conducted with 20,000 secondary students revealed an increase in the "false Insta" pages.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students said they had a "main" account to show their parents
One in five - some of them are only 11 - opens an account on social media that he keeps hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in the secondary school revealed a rapid growth of the "false Insta Accounts" - a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students reported to manage a "main" account cleaned to show it to their parents, while having a private account.
A mother who accidentally fell on the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who encouraged others to “viole me. ”
According to the study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 have a double profile, half of students recognising having private accounts.
The head of the CSM Mike Buchanan said, "It's worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create places online where parents and teachers do not find them."
Eilidh Doyle will represent the athletes at the Scottish Athletics Board.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie described this choice as an excellent opportunity for the leaders of this sport to take advantage of its extensive international experience over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys enormous respect in the Scottish, British and global sports community, and we are sure that sports in Scotland would benefit enormously from its participation in the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I really want to be the voice of athletes and I really want to be able to make my contribution and guide this sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 metres in 1996 at the Atlanta Olympic Games where he won four gold medals and now is a regular commentator of the BBC, was unable to walk after having suffered a transitional ischemical attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I had an AVC.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors said that only time would say if I would recover or how much.
It was a painful job, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again and today I do exercises of agility!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!"
On-line, an advertising on milk shoot that compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An online advertising by a company proposing a milk shoot compares breastfeeding mothers with cows during trafficking.
In order to mark the launch of what is called the "first silent milk shooter in the world", Elvie, a large-scale technology company, launched a fierce advertising inspired by a musical video clip to show the freedom that its new milk shooter offers breastfeeding women.
In a barn of cows filled with hay, four true mothers dance in the rhythm of a song whose words are: "Yes, I wear myself, but you don't see a queue" and "In case you didn't notice it, they are my breasts, not the mammals."
The abstinence continues: "Pump it, pump it, I feed the babies, pump it, pump it, pump it, I help women wear milk."
However, the advertising, which was published on the company's Facebook page, generated an online polemic.
With 77,000 visualizations and hundreds of comments, the video has received contradictory reactions from the public, many of which say it lights on the "horrific" of the dairy industry.
"A bad decision than using cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to milk, except that their babies are removed from them within the days of their birth," one of them wrote.
Elvie's milk shooting adapts discreetly to a breast breast support (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "This is a understandable trauma for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a milk shoot for mothers who keep their baby?"
Someone else added: "A advertisement so disconnected."
Others defended advertising, for example, a woman admitting that she found the song "music".
"I think it's an idea of genius.
I would have bought one if I were still breast-feeding.
Pomper gave me the impression of being a cow.
The advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what she was.
It's a great product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: "It's a fun advertising for mothers who draw their milk (often at their workplace or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
It is not an advertising that praises the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women showed to have danced with discrete milk shooters hidden in their breast support.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the draw-milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's milk shooting is completely silent, without wires or pipes and is discreetly inserted into a breast breast-feeding, giving women the freedom to move, keep their baby and even go out while pulling their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and DPE at Mother, commented: "The milk shoot Elvie is a product so revolutionary that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
In parallel with breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while in a fun and reliable way expressing the incredible feeling of freedom that this new milk-shot will bring.
It's not the first time Elvie was shooting.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two children appeared on the stage of the designer Marta Jakubowski while using this product.
Hundreds of children of migrants have settled quietly in a camp at the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased significantly, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, partly due to the fact that the severe speeches and policies of the Trump administration have made the placement of children more difficult for respondents.
Traditionally, most respondents themselves were paperless immigrants, and they feared to compromise their own ability to stay in the country by seeking the rescue of a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their home should submit their fingerprints and that such data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior staff member of the Immigration and Customs Service, witnessed last week before the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested sponsorship from non-accompanied minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested persons had no judicial history.
"Approximately 80% of people who are respondents or members of their families are illegally present here, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to prosecute these people," said Albence.
According to refugee stakeholders, in order to deal with the case of children more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court in the month following their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the standard before.
Many of them will appear by videoconferencing, rather than by themselves, to plead their cause with respect to their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons considered not eligible will be expelled quickly.
According to stakeholders and reports submitted by the refugee network in recent months, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violence or escape attempts.
In a large establishment like Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that the signs that a child is in difficulty are more likely to be neglected due to its size, according to the rights defenders of the child.
They added that moving children to camp without giving them time to prepare themselves emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could accentuate trauma that many have hard to manage.
Syria calls on the American, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw from the camp.
In an address to the United Nations General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in that country is now in his eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that they would be "treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and without condition," he said to the assembly.
Moualem argued that the "war against terrorism" is almost over in Syria, while more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of others have been deracined from their homes.
He indicated that Damascus would continue "to carry out this sacred battle until all Syrian territories were purged" both from both terrorist groups and from any "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of whom form and advise both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bachar al-Assad.
In this country that was ravaged by the war, France has more than 1,000 soldiers on site.
Moualem stated that the conditions were favourable to their return, and accused “some Western countries” of “provoking irrational concerns” that discouraged refugees from returning.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to make these returns easier," he said.
"They are politiciating what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have indicated that there would be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end this war was concluded.
The United Nations diplomats state that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last rebel fortress of Idlib has led to progress in political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement avoided a large-scale attack on the province where three million people live, by Syrian forces supported by Russia.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement provided for "specific deadlines" and expressed the hope that military measures would target the jihadists, in particular the Nusra Front fighters, who are linked to Al-Qaida and will be "exterminated".
Staffan de Mistura, United Nations representative, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee meeting members of the government and the opposition in order to draft a post-war constitution and prepare the way for the elections in Syria.
Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, stating that the work of the group should be limited to “the revision of the articles of the current Constitution”, and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, the depression and scandal lead him to leave his presidency prematurely.
Which would probably be "The most spectacular final of a presidency!"
At the moment, the public has no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, top-time ratings have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and have virtually tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at large-time listening hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the "Rachel Maddow Show" of MSNBC, which reaches 3.5 million viewers at large evenings, is the first cable television channel.
"It's a matter that attracts people because it's not something we understand," commented Neal Baer, presenter of the ABC drama series "Designed Survivor", who speaks of a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitole.
Nell Scovell, a surrounded comic writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And some irrefutable truths about slipping into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked her.
"He answered, "Because he makes me laugh," said Ms. Scovell.
Chaos has a ludic value.
Obviously, contrary to all that happens on television, Washington's scenarios could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, if immigrants' families can meet together and the health of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most skilled viewers can afford.
And however, this goes beyond being an informed citizen when one finds himself looking at a panel of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward used a "great know-how" for his book "Fear", on the $15,000 straw-leather jacket of Paul Manafort ("a dress filled with pride" according to the Washington Post) and the consequences of the extravagant descriptions Stormy Daniels delivered to Mr. Trump's anatomy.
On my side, I will never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"If part of what he's doing gives the impression of seeing a tele-reality show, it's because he makes you swallow something every night," said Brent Montgomery, Director General of Wheelhouse Entertainment and Creator of "Pawn Stars", about the changing teams and the daily changes in Trump's situation (beating with the NFL, congratulate Kim Jong-un).
We can't afford to miss an episode if we're not on track.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he was 26 degrees at home on the north shore of Kauai, but he would go inside to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't stand out, not with Brett Kavanaugh who was preparing to confront the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember the time when we were animation all these crazy programs and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," told me Mr. Fleiss.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Outside money invades the closest mid-mandat elections
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is flooded with money, thanks to a realignment of the Congress districts that allowed two owners to dispute the same seat.
This district of the suburb of Pittsburgh, which has recently been restructured, is the seat of the representative of Democrat Conor Lamb, who took its seat in another electoral district during the special elections last spring.
Lamb meets another owner, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which rely heavily on the new 17th district.
The cards were redesigned when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the former arrondissements were unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The race of the new 17th district led to a confrontation with regard to the financing of electoral campaigns between the major branches of party funding, the Congress Committee for Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a victory won in righteousness last March in a very popular special election in the 18th district of the Pennsylvania Congress.
This seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the victory in the district by 20 points.
Politologists have given democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered to punish Salvador for its support for China and then declined
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which Washington had not opposed.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panaman President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the leadership of the Trump Organization.
The representatives of the Department of State decided to convene the heads of American diplomatic missions in Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest against "the recent decisions they made not to recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, department spokesperson, in a communiqué at the beginning of the month.
But sanctions were only provided for against Salvador, which received an estimated US aid of $140 million in 2017, including for controlling drugs and providing development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and homicide.
While the internal meetings continued, the representatives of North and Central America delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting held last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from visiting the United States.
But in mid-September, the senior officials of the administration clearly stated that they wanted the conference to continue, thus ending any consideration of sanctions against Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence now spoke at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, in order to demonstrate the importance of the administration to the meeting, made known to the diplomats.
And the three American emittents were peacefully returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new messages or severe punishment from Washington.
A spokesperson from Mr. Bolton at the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions under the cover of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Study History
The next tile could be the report of Special Advocate Robert Mueller on the possible obstacle to Mr. Trump's justice. The public file is now supported by substantial evidence.
Mr Mueller would also guide his inquiry towards the question of a convincingness of Mr Trump's campaign with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congress's control changes, Mr. Trump will be obliged to account for this body, when he is about to represent himself before the electors and, perhaps, before a jury composed of his peers.
These are many "yes," and I do not claim that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - or that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic which will affect the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, the German officers were about to organize a coup d'État against Hitler, if only the West had held his head and rejected the Czechoslovakias in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history turns around these gaps and the inevitable march of democracy accelerates or is delayed.
Americans are currently facing a number of these gaps.
What will we do if Mr. Trump returns the Deputy to General Attorney Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed to register the President secretly and made assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein said that the reportage of the Times was inaccurate.
"What will we answer if the recent FBI investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial - or if it is confiscated to the Supreme Court despite charges of sexual aggression and unhonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote for the mid-mandate elections for a Congress that will ask for account to Mr. Trump?
If we do not succeed in these trials, democracy will spend a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who previously occupied my ambassador residence.
She survived, immigrated to America and, sixty years later, sent me to turn on the swastika table of the sabbath candles.
With this heritage in inheritance, I cannot be optimistic about our future."

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, trusting in the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna Thursday, while knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following the impressive zero match in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a strong position to qualify as Group G in the League of Europe.
A knee injury has deprived Graham Dorrans of his first participation in the season until the zero 2:2 game against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to draw the best from such a result to achieve exploits.
"This was a positive point for us, because Villarreal is a quality team," commented 31-year-old attacker.
"We entered the game by thinking of getting something and we got back with a point.
We might have been able to win it at the end, but, overall, a zero game was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we returned in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a little chance, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they made a good result during their last match, yet I am sure we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
Last year was really difficult, between my injuries and the changes made to the club as such, but there is a factor of satisfaction about this place now.
The team is good and the guys have a lot of fun; training is of quality.
Let's hope we can move forward now, leave last season behind and triumph."
Women no longer find sleep due to this fear of their retirement savings
Although the participants in this survey knew clearly how they wanted to take care of them, few people spoke about the issue with members of their families.
Nearly half of those who participated in the national study said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 per cent reported having spoken to their children.
"The people want a family member to take care of them, but they do not do what they need to have this conversation," explained Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Branch.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouses and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not communicate your wishes well in advance.
Collaborate with your advisor and family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor is also able to help you establish a way to pay these fees.
Your decisions on long-term care financing may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy of value for money to help you cover these expenses or any other insurance on your property - provided you have the means to ensure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Provide a health care commission that will allow you to designate a trusted person who will verify your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also a procuration regarding your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and make sure that your invoices are paid if you are incapacitated.
Think of the details: Let's assume your parent has a medical emergency and he goes to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
"There are not only the finances at stake, but also who are the doctors?", asked Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Put this plan in place."
A man has been injured several times with a compressed air gun in Ilfracombe
A man received several shots with a compressed air gun while he came back on foot from a evening.
The victim, 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove region in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
The police described the incident, which took place around 2:30 BST, as a "a random act".
The victim didn't see his aggressor.
His injuries do not threaten his life and the police have launched a witness call.
Seisms and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that destroyed the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, announced the authorities, and the balance is expected to increase.
As communications were paralyzed, emergency services could not receive any information from the Donggala Reignance, a northern area of Palu, which is more close to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake epicenter.
In Palu, more than 16,000 persons were evacuated as a result of the disaster.
Some essential facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, whose population was estimated to be 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquakes and the tsunami took place.
Donggala is a reign that extends more than 300 km (180 miles) northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the reign, an administrative region below a province, was estimated to be 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy in the province of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times over a century, according to the Indonesian Agency for the Reduction of Disasters.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of residences in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the west of Donggala in 1996, making nine dead.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific seismic fire circle and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Here are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake, which occurred on 26 December on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, triggered a tsunami that landed over 14 countries, making 226,000 victims on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes shaken the west coast of Sumatra in late March at the beginning of April.
A few hundred people died on the island of Nias, next to Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of a size of 6.8 reached the south of Java, the most inhabited island of Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that touched the south coast and made nearly 700 victims.
2009: An earthquake of a size of 7.6 shaken the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Sumatra West.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-dimensional earthquake destroyed one of Mentawai islands, next to Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami of more than 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A surface earthquake shake the reign of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding the inhabitants of the devastation caused by the killing earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
No tsunami has been caused this time, but more than 100 people have been killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes have shaken the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily blocked.
Sarah Palin's elder son arrested for marital violence
Track Palin, the elder son of the former Governor of Alaska and candidate for vice-president Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, 29 years old, originated in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspects of marital violence, violating a signal of marital and arrest-resistant violence, according to a communiqué published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he would have taken the phone of a woman's knowledge trying to call the police to report suspected crimes.
Palin is in temporary detention in Mat-Su's interim detention centre and is held under non-guaranteed guarantor of $500, said KTUU.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, saying "not guilty, it's safe" when his plea was requested, announced the network.
Palin faces three Class A offences, which means that he may be sentenced to a prison sentence of up to one year and is liable to a fine of $250,000.
He was also accused of committing a Class B minor offence punished by a day of prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not the first time that criminal charges are brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report this alleged assault.
The case is under way before the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with marital violence, interference in the report of a crime of marital violence and possession of a weapon in a state of bride in connection with the incident.
His companion had pretended he had hit her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking the violent behaviour of her son to the PTSD resulting from her service in Iraq.
Seism in Indonesia: several hundred deaths
At least 384 people died as a result of the earthquake that shaken the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and ravaged thousands of houses.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are out of stock and victims' balance sheets are expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake declared itself right next to the center of Sulawesi, in the northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos broadcast on social media show the impact point.
Several hundred people met for a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time the tsunami broke off the coast.
Federal prosecutors claim a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors claim the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspected New York attacker who made eight victims - a rare punishment that has not been applied in that State for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, would have used a rented truck from Home Depot to attack a bicycle track on the West Side Highway, in Lower Manhattan, on his pedestrian road and a cyclist last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" murdered the eight victims and "intentionally" imposed serious body damage, according to the statement of intent to request the death penalty filed with the South District of New York.
Both charges are likely to result in the death penalty, according to the legal document.
A few weeks after this aggression, a large federal jury sentenced Saipov to 22 indictors, including eight murder charges for money extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "scrupulous preparation and premediation," said the prosecutors, qualifiing the method used by Saipov as "awesome, cruel and disgraceful."
" Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," said the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
The South District of New York had not claimed the death penalty in the course of prosecution for ten years.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was declared guilty of the murder of two drug traffickers, but later sentenced to a life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case, it was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for committing conspiracy and spying for the USSR over the two years following the cold war.
Both Rosenberg were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, originated in Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of regret within the days and months following the tragedy, according to legal evidence.
According to the police, he reported to the investigators that he was satisfied with his actions.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been encouraged to commit the attack after watching Daesh's videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to post the flag of Daesh in his hospital room, specified the police.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 indictors.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said that he was "of course disappointed" with the decision to prosecute.
"We believe that the decision to request the death penalty rather than to accept its plea of guilt and to condemn it to lifetime prison without the possibility of release can only extend the trauma associated with these events for all interested parties," Patton said.
The Saipov defense team had already asked the prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
A Conservative Member states that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the People's Army" at a demonstration at the Conservative Conference.
The former of the UK Independence Party said that politicians should feel the pressure of the Euroscepticists - as one of Theresa May's members suggested, he should be responsible for negotiating with the EU.
The Conservative Member Peter Bone said at Birmingham's march that the United Kingdom would have "be released" if Mr. Farage had been secretary at Brexit.
But the dilemma that Mrs May is confronted with to reconcile her deeply divided troops was highlighted by the Conservatives in favour of the idea of staying in the Union which joined an isolated demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has hard to maintain his Chequers' compromise plan despite the threats of those who want to get out and those who want to stay as well as the EU.
The Allies stressed that she would continue her attempts to reach agreement with Brussels despite hostilities - and would force euroscepticists and labourers to choose between her programme and "chaos".
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave gathering in Solihull that he wanted to "remove Chequers".
He felt that Mr Farage should have become a partner and had the task of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would already be out," he said.
Wellingborough's member added: "I will defend the Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: "We have not delivered ourselves to world wars to subject ourselves.
We want to make our own laws in our own homeland."
Mr. Bone has removed the suggestions that public opinion has evolved since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have turned the page and want to remain is completely false."
Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, who was in favour of the exit, was also present during the walk to tell the journalists: "I just say, Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for, it is also the case of our party and of our activists who run the streets and make us elected first.
Abort Chequers and start listening."
In a message directed to Ms. May, she added: The Prime Ministers retain their jobs when they honour their promises."
"Mr. Farage said at the meeting that politicians should be "pressed" if they were about to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a question of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
They are trying to betray the Brexit and we are telling them today, "We will not let you out of this."
He added in a message addressed to the enthusiastic crowd: "I wish you would feel the pressure on our political class, which is about to betray the Brexit.
We mobilize the people's army of this country that has allowed us to win the victory in Brexit and we will not stop until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, pro-European supporters walked through Birmingham before organising a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A small number of activists fired conservative banners against the Brexit after the launch of the group this weekend.
His worker counterpart Lord Adonis laughed at the Conservatives because of security issues regarding the application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the ones that ensure that they are able to implement computer systems and all technology for Canada, more, for the free frontier without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a real fake.
A good Brexit, it doesn't exist," he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider the possibility of attending presidential elections
Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she would seriously consider the possibility of attending the presidential elections after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat of Massachusetts discussed his future on Saturday at a public assembly in the west of Massachusetts.
Warren, a often critical voice against President Donald Trump, is presenting for the reelection in November against Geoff Diehl, the representative of the GOP in the States, who was co-chairman in 2016 for the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It was at the centre of the speculation that could confront Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with the voters in a public assembly since Trump took office.
One participant asked her whether she intended to present herself to the Presidency.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which means having a woman in the head of the state.
Arrest at the death of Sims from Louisiana State University
On Saturday, the Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the death of basketball player Wayde Sims, a LSU basketball player, on Friday.
The Baton Red Police Service participated in the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at 11:00 H.E. Press conference.
On Friday, they had published a video of the shooting, asking for help to identify a man on the images.
Sims, 20 years old, was killed by a bullet on Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
" Wayde Sims got a bullet wound to the head and caused his injuries," said police chief Murphy J. Paul, on Saturday, at 247 sports.
Wayde took his friend's defense and was shot by Simpson.
Interviewed, Simpson admitted to have been on the spot, in possession of a gun, and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without an incident and put in custody at the East Baton Red parish police department.
Sims, a 2 m young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, disputed 32 games, including 10 as part of last season, and totaled an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is heading to the world title after the team's guidelines allowed him to win the victory against Sebastian Vettel
It quickly became clear from the time Valtteri Bottas qualified by predeclining Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the Mercedes team's instructions would play an important role in the competition.
From the pole position, Bottas took a good start and frayed Hamilton on the flank while defending his place in the first two towers, and invited Vettel to attack his team partner.
Vettel entered the stands first and left Hamilton to start into the peloton's queue torment, which should have been a decisive element.
The Mercedes passed through the stands a tour later and found itself behind Vettel, but Hamilton took advantage of a wheel action that saw the Ferrari pilot leaving the inside side at the risk of resisting after a double attempt to defend in the third turn.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round to celebrate his 21 years old.
He then dominated a large part of the race while now his tyres to aim for a fast arrival and to advance Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally arrived in the stands at the 44th tower, but was not able to accelerate the pace in the remaining eight towers, Raikkonen ranking himself fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri has done a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team did an exceptional job to get one two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language
At a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein, who stressed that she had not disclosed Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
The president, speaking at a meeting in Virginia-Occidental, did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate's judicial commission, but he argued that the events in the Senate showed that people were "bad, disgusting and dishonest."
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that is happening in the Senate in recent days, when one sees anger, when one sees people who are angry and evil and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"Showing the disclosures and leaks, they say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you disclosed any information?
Remember his answer... did you disclose information - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't disclose anything."
Well, wait a minute.
Have we disclosed information... No, we have not disclosed information," he added, thinking about the impression of the senator.
Feinstein received from Ford last July the letter describing in detail the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the disclosure took place in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't disclose his story," said Feinstein to the committee," said The Hill.
"She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked me."
But his negation does not seem to be well received by the President, who commented on Saturday evening at the meeting: "I'm going to tell you, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Sustaining his defence of the candidate to the Supreme Court, accused of sexual assault by three women, the President reported that the democrats used these allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to resume power by all means.
You see maliciousness, messengery, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control," said the president to Mediaite.
Elite League : Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars erased their defeat on Friday in Elite League against the Giants of Belfast by taking the 5-3 game back to Dundee last Saturday.
The Giants opened the score thanks to two goals by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie returned equality at home before Dwyer returned the benefit to Giants.
François Bouchard equalized for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen entered two goals, guaranteeing them the victory.
This was the third defeat of the Elite League season for Adam Keefe players, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 Friday night in Belfast, after being caught.
This was the fourth confrontation of the season between the two camps, the Giants triumphing in the last three matches.
Dwyer gave the advantage to the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a passage from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the stake four minutes later.
During a first well-loaded period, Sullivan relaunched the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt joined Cownie at 15:16, with an equalization.
Dwyer assured the Giants' advance before the first break when he hit his second goal from the evening to the end of the first period.
The local team gathered and Bouchard once again equalized with a goal giving a digital advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran have worked together to help Nielsen put Dundee at the top for the first time at the end of the second period, thus ensuring the victory to his team by marking a fifth goal in the mid-course.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will welcome Milton Keynes at their next match on Friday.
An air traffic controller died by helping hundreds of people on board a plane to escape from the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is greeted as a hero after he died by ensuring that an aircraft carrying hundreds of people can take off safely.
More than 800 people died and many others disappeared after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replices continue to ravage the region and a large number of people are trapped under dooms in the city of Palu.
But despite the escape of his colleagues, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21 years old, refused to abandon his position in the violently shaken tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri de Palu airport.
He stayed on site to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the track at that time, could start safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt that it collapsed.
He died later at the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, the spokesman of Air Navigation Indonesia, said that this action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"Our heart is broken from learning this," he added.
The authorities are concerned that the number of deaths could reach thousands, the country's disaster prevention agency indicating that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance sheet would continue to expand because many bodies were still under the dooms and many could not be saved," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the agency.
Up to six metres of waves have ravaged Palu, which will celebrate a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide help and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance brings back the bodies.
Clean water is rare.
The mini-markets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, responsible for the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is short to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could worsen."
Joko Widodo, the Indonesian president, arrived in Palu Sunday and addressed the country's soldiers: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?", said CNN.
Indonesia was shaken earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Aeroplane accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now declares that a man disappeared after the crash of an aircraft in the lagoon.
The airline operating the flight that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that a man is missing after the 47 passengers and crew members have safely evacuated the flying plane.
Air Niugini stated in a communiqué that since Saturday afternoon, she was unable to find the trace of a male passenger.
The airline indicated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the person in question.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more detailed information concerning the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships participated in the rescue of other passengers and crew after the aircraft hit the water by trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
The authorities stated on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline stated on Saturday that six passengers were still in the hospital, and that they were all in a stable state.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the aircraft had landed in the lagoon near the landing track.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crossed the track.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes indicated that the plane had arrived too low.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others could have slipped into the water to the emergency exits of the plane.
he said that the crew officers had panicked and cried, and that he suffered minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that the sailors working close to the improvement of a dock had also participated in rescue using a pneumatic boat to transport people on the land before the plane flows in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 persons have died in air carrier accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the last two decades, but none of them concerned Air Niugini.
The analyst presents the chronology of the night when the woman was burned alive
The charge suspended his file on Saturday in the trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the US Department of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the phone records from a cell phone to track the movements of the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night the last person died.
Rowlett reported that he had obtained location data from several mobile phones that indicated that Tellis e was with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers while he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford.
Sanford appeared at the bar on Saturday and witnessed that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that he was "leading" because my truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency lies in the fact that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show that they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett argued that some time after Chambers died, Tellis deleted Chambers' SMS, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," Hale said.
The defense must begin its pleadings on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the trial to be held before the jury in the course of the day.
The High Breed: What is the political hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative vision of the genre by impressing its music of positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has gone away from its origins from political messages and social problems.
The group wants to reboot with its roots and make the hip hop political again popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a recent resurgence in the United Kingdom thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black girl?!
A New York nurse pursues a couple in court for dismissing him after a "racist" text
A New York nurse pursues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an error message from the mother who complained that she was “never a black woman”.
The couple refutes being racist, and assimilates prosecution to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her anxiety in 2016 finding that Giselle Maurice, the new nurse, was black when she arrived for her first day of work.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOON ENCORE A NOIRE," Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him twice to Ms. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after having understood her cautious, "uncomfortable," Plasco-Flaxman returned Ms. Maurice, explaining to her that her former nanny, who was African American, had done a bad job and that she was waiting for a Philippine rather.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a working day and then returned to her home by an Uber.
Mauritius now pursues the couple in court in order to obtain compensation for his resignation and claims a $ 350 per day compensation for the six-month home service for which it was initially hired, but without a contract.
"I want to make them understand, listen, we don't do this kind of thing," she said at the Post Friday, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by saying that it was reasonable to put an end to Maurice's employment, fearing not to be able to trust him after doing him wrong.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," said Joel Plasco at the Post.
"But would you confide your children to a person with whom you were unpolite, even if it was mistaken?
Your newborn?
Let's see."
Assimilaring the trial to "extortion", Plasco stated that his wife was only two months from having a baby and was in a "very delicate situation".
"You're going after someone like that?
It's not a very pleasant thing to do," added the business banker.
While the file is still in progress, the public opinion court has no doubt in denouncing the couple about social media, accusing them of their behaviour and logic.
Paddington's publishers feared that the readers would not identify themselves with a bear who speaks, reveals a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about this letter: "It is difficult to replace someone who beds him for the first time before his publication.
It's very fun, knowing what we know about Paddington's huge success."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the book for children inspired by a small bully bear, would have remained optimistic with the rejection of her work. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books had had a "soft-amerous" taste after her death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family," and adds that her father was very proud of her final success.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he wasn't a pretentious man," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real for him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds something: we are proud of him, even though it is not really his own achievement.
I think he saw Paddington's success in this way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he has always attributed the merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
At the landing, his daughter had been taken urgently to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried everything they could to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to explain how bad the situation was, we were not expecting it to be done," commented Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called me to warn me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that the doctors had given him to maintain the heart rate were slowly exhausting and getting out of his system.
She had died some time earlier and everything stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold it."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, in mourning her daughter, climbed in the plane with the other passengers, without worrying about the test she was going through.
"No one was aware," she said.
"I had my head fucked, and I cried all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this huge sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women in mourning lay postcards to prevent suicide on the bridges.
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide strive to prevent others from taking away their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted postcards on a Galilee bridge containing inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I'm forced to feel every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, 45 years old and residing in Lydney, said that her son was a promising leader with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile illuminated any piece."
However, he left his job before he died, as he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, found his brother after his suicide.
Ms. Davis said, "I constantly fear that there will be a training effect."
Ms. Davis created the maps "to make people know that there are people you can go to and to whom you can talk, even if it's a friend.
Don't keep quiet - you have to talk."
Ms. Humphreys, a long-standing friend of Ms. Davis, has lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt shot, depressed or anything else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed his change of attitude.
He was at the lowest on Christmas day - when the children opened their gifts, he had no visual contact with them or nothing."
She indicated that her death represented a huge trauma for them, but they must get out of it: "It's disgusting for the family.
It's ruining us.
But we all have to go forward and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future was at stake while the FBI started his investigation.
"I thought that if we could get something like what he asked - a limited investigation in time, limited in its scope - we might be able to bring some unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would "break" into a partisan impasse.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republicans supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of the moment.
The mid-mandat elections will take place only in five weeks, namely November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans achieve a bad score, they will seriously weaken their attempts to make the man they want elected at the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was his personal secretary at the time.
What will happen after the FBI has presented its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where currently are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
We do not yet know whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to start the vote and confirm it before the Supreme Court.
North Korea: the number of "fall" deserters under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean desertists to South Korea has decreased since the rise in Kim Jong-un's power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Department of South Unification, said that 1 127 deserts had taken place last year, compared with 2 706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in the tariffs required by transitlers were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of North Deserts will eventually be granted South Korean nationality.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them flee from China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers desertists to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often returns to force.
The relations between the North and the South - which are technically still in war - have improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang in the context of interviews focused on the negotiations for denuclearization which remained in suspense until now.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in general, to work for a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ri Yong-ho, has attributed to the US sanctions the lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to conduct unilateral disarmament," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi qualifies Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical" and claims that he is unable to sit at the Supreme Court
Pelosi, the leader of the parliamentary minority, appointed the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical" and declared that he was unable to sit at the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made these comments as part of an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't stop thinking that if a woman had acted like this, they would have treated her as "hysterical", said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Committee of the Judiciary last Thursday.
Kavanaugh, with emotion, denied the allegations that he had sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and sometimes almost screamed and suffocated by mentioning his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the democrats sitting in the committee, calling the allegations concerning him a "grosque and coordinated murder" organized by liberals disappointed that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that, according to her, Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was unable to sit at the Supreme Court, since he showed that he was against the Democrats.
"I think he discredits himself with these statements and the way he took it with Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when he was asked whether she would try to destitute Kavanaugh if it was confirmed, and whether the Democrats were getting the majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not only unable to sit at the Supreme Court, but he is also unable to sit in the court where he is currently," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the DC Circle Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since he was considered a conservative judge.
During his charges confirmation hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh ruled the question of the possible reversal of certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for a hysterical and partial person to go to court and expect us to say, "it's not wonderful," said Pelosi.
And women have to use it.
It's a legitimate diatribe, months and years of anger that overflows, and it can't get her out without crying.
"We are crying when we are angry," said Ms. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's rare, and you?"
"I was greatly helped by a woman who was frame somewhere, who told me that she was also crying when she was getting angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person she was talking to, when she was getting angry and crying: "You can think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she continued.
And I found this brilliant."
The tears are allowed as an exutor to anger, partly because they are fundamentally incomprehensible.
One of my most remarkable memories of a first job, in a office dominated by men, where I one day found myself crying for an inexpressive anger, was that I had been seized by the skin of the neck by an elderly woman - a cold director who had always been a little scared of me - who led me into a staircase.
"Don't let them see you cry in any case," she told me.
"They don't know that you are angry.
They believe you sad and are happy because they have had you."
Patricia Schroeder, then MEP of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on her presidential elections.
In 1987, while Mr. Hart had been taken in an extramarital case on board a boat called Monkey Business and had withdrawn from the campaign, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said that there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of presenting herself to the Presidency.
"It wasn't a maturely thoughtful decision," she told me by laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the lice, and the last thing they missed was one more person.
Somebody had called that "Snow White and the Seven Nains".
As the campaign was very advanced, it had been delayed in collecting funds, and therefore swore that it would not participate unless it would collect $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters who usually donated $1,000 to men were planning to give her only $250.
"Do they think I'm entitled to a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so upset by her emotions - the gratitude for the people who had supported her, the frustration of the system that made the collection of funds and the targeting of voters rather than delegates, and the anger against sexism - so difficult that she felt dizzy.
"You would have thought that I was making a nervous depression," she remembered Mrs. Schroeder about the press reaction to her.
"You would have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were gonna put on my tombstone.
"She was crying?"
How trade war between the United States and China could benefit in Beijing
The first salves of the trade war between the United States and China have been ashorrifying, and although the battle is far from being completed, a long-term disagreement between the countries could benefit in Beijing, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump launched the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The largest increase has occurred this week with new customs duties affecting items worth US$200 billion (£150 billion), thus taxing half of all goods from China that arrive in the United States.
Each time, Beijing retaliated in nature, hitting recently customs duties from $5 to 10% on $60 billion of US goods.
China has committed itself to equalizing the United States, and it is unlikely that the second largest world economy will soon flee.
Putting Washington back back is giving up on demands, but giving publicly before the United States would be much too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
The experts, however, believe that if Beijing can play its role properly, the pressures of the US trade war could have a positive impact on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"In fact, the fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions favourable to economic slowdown in either country is far more dangerous than the observers have previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a research partner focusing on Asia, to the Centre for New American Security reflection group.
Syria is "prepared" for the return of refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria stands ready for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks assistance to rebuild the country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation on site is more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The Government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary repatriation of refugees in the country they have been forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have desertified the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome aid for the reconstruction of this devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that sponsored the insurrection.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018 by defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10,5 at the National Golf near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the title when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn crossed the 14,5 points necessary to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was in trouble during most of the tournament, pushed his start into the water at the 16th hole in par-3, handing over his duel to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players who have never reached 5-0-0 since the current tournament format, whose first edition was in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was removed from 5 to 4 by the least well placed player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The world's best golfer, Dustin Johnson, turned 2 and 1 face to the English Ian Poulter, who might have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the champion of Europe of all time with a total of 25.5 career points.
"In general, I don't cry, but today it's stronger than me.
It was a moving year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for having chosen and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cut.
What matters is the team, and I am happy to have been able to help it," said with emotion Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the flame to his countryman John Ram who defeated the legend of the American Tiger Woods 2-1 golf in simple, last Sunday.
"I feel an incredible pride to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy," said Rahm, 23 years old.
Woods lost his four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup career.
A surprising statistics for one of the biggest golfers of all time, who recorded 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The United States team has had a lot of trouble all weekends to find fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance about his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we had a certain time when we put pressure on Europe.
We've abandoned.
Hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players all played very well.
We're going to join together, I'm going to work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going ahead.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud of being captain.
We need to be inclined.
We've been crossed."
