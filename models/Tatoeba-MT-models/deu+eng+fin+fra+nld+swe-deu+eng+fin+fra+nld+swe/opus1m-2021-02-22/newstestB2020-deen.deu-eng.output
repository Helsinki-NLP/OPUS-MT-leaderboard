Fire in French Chemistry Deleted
The large fire in a particularly dangerous chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been removed. This was reported to the Normandy prefecture on Friday. The fire had been broken out at night on Thursday. No one was injured during the incident. The firefighter was in operation with about 200 discharge vehicles.
The fire could be stopped
Anrainers were asked not to leave their houses. Buildings around 500 metres were evacuated, schools and nurseries were closed on Thursday. In the chemical plant at the shore of the Seine, additives for lubricants are manufactured. The factory belongs to the US-Millardär Warren Buffett company and is subject to the so-called EU Seveso Directive, which imposes particularly strict safety requirements.
In the plant, about 400 people worked. The chemical factory already provided headlines in the past - for example, when in 2013 the gas methanthiol escaped through a leak and the surrounding area smelled extensively to lazy eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's sewage system.
Woman quits her job to search for her missing bitch 57 days
For two months, a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog and announced her job. The seven-year-old Border Collie had run out of the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days were missing every track from the bitch - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got bad," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake". She and her husband had left Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. Then when they returned to the hotel, Katie disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Donner had paniced dog
In the hope that Katie could still stay somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "She left about four, four and a half hours ago", recalls Carole King to "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie was immediately pulled out. Probably a loud thunder had panicked the dog.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the kings searched for their loved dog. But days were weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake", who fired her job as a postage employee to continue looking for Katie.
"The tears flew"
57 days after Katies disappeared, Carole King received a call: a man logged in and said that Katie was found in his courtyard. But when King arrived there, Katie had already disappeared. She was looking for the neighborhood and suddenly stood her bitch under a tree. "I just embraced her. I didn't want to let her go," said King, "Daily Inter Lake". "The tears flew. People stopped in their vehicles, rose out and embraced us. I think the whole neighborhood knew that we had found her."
Losses in the Federal Defence: Machine guns disappear without any trace
Friday, September 27, 2019
Six MG3 machine guns are still missing.
In recent years, the Federal Defence has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of guns, including three machine guns. The remainder is in most cases unclear. The opposition speaks of a "horrific" scale.
Arms and ammunition are disappearing again and again - many of them have not yet been traced. Since the beginning of 2014, the troops have lost 39 weapons, 39 parts and nearly 20,000 guns. This is the result of a list of the Federal Ministry of Defense classified as secrets, on which the German editorial network reports.
According to the paper from the office of Secretary of the State of Defence Peter Tauber from the CDU, two weapons, one gun and 3474 shotguns have been reappeared. The still missing weapons and parts include six machine guns of type MG3, eleven G3, four guns of type G36, six signal guns and two guns of type P8. In addition, 30 guns for machine guns of type MG3 are missing.
The extent of arms and ammunition losses in the Federal Defence was "screaming," said the left-wing member Martina Renner. This was all the more, since in the course of investigations little was found again. The left-wing politician spoke of a "poor balance sheet". Renner criticized that the list was not recognisable whether under the missing ammunition was also the one found in connection with the investigations against the suspected Federal Defence Officer Franco A. "and that although a supporter of Franco A. was recently convicted of the possession of this ammunition," said Renner.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after it was established by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker moved and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was indicated as a destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but he remained in Iranian waters at first. The shipowner said that one wanted to wait for an official notification from Teheran.
The "Stena Impero" was accused on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards on Hormuz Sea Road of having violated security rules, but it was assumed that Iran responded to the controversial, temporary establishment of an Iranian oil tanker in front of Gibraltar, which belongs to the United Kingdom.
The Hormuz road is one of the most important seaways in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the global oil exports are shipped through the seas. The tensions in the region have increased dramatically in recent months. Trade shipping has been invaded in the conflict between the USA and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
Merkel appreciates the courage of people in the Peaceful Revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has appreciated the commitment of the people in the DDR who went on the streets 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In autumn 1989 courageous citizens would have put the then GDR regime in the wreck, said Merkel at a festive act by the Thuringian CDU Group on the next day of German Unity in Erfurt. The Chancellor reminded, among other things, of the occupation of the Stasi Centre. "The security of the state was taken to fear," she said.
Musk strives to deliverance record
Tesla's quarter may keep record ready. Despite delivery boom, the last losses were made at the electric car group.
New York.Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given his electric car group strong boost on the stock exchange with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla's employees, published by industry blog "Electrek".
The demand is strong, so that Tesla could book 110000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter. The challenge is to quickly bring the cars to the customer. To that end Tesla must offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares were traded with more than six percent. The price has not been so high for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered more than 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs record to achieve its high targets. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. In the current and next quarter, six-digit numbers are required. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is requested, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Riddles Solved: That's why we can't kitten ourselves
A kind of brake in the big brain prevents people from kitteling themselves. This was found by scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin using experiments on rats as they reported on Thursday evening. There was also progress in the question of why children were so violently opposed to kitteling, only to demand more.
Finally, it was also shown why the approach of a kitzeling hand alone triggered laughter before touching. This was on a deep layer of the big brain, which already triggered laughing during the expectation of the kitzel.
According to previous research, rats react with "laughs" in the ultrasound area when they are catered by humans. This "laughs" is conveyed by the part of the big brain, which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Smiling is suppressed during self-contact
So far, it has been assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-contraction and contact by others - that is why people cannot kittel themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now found, during the experiments on the rats, that the laugh as well as the activity of the area concerned of the big brain cattle are suppressed during self-contraction. This is also the case if living beings clean themselves. However, during the foreign touch and kitzel by the scientists, the activity in the brain and the impulse to laugh were strengthened.
But if you pass the self-contact and contact by others at the same time, the laughter is also suppressed. This indicates that the brain of the rat cannot distinguish between self-contact and contact by others. The new findings suggest that people cannot kittel themselves because the self-contact activates a brake in the big brain.
The rats were also trained to kittle themselves. In this case, they broke this initiation in the experiment sometimes early, showing escape behaviour or horror. This ambivalence is similar to the behaviour of the children. The ambivalence of the kitzel is a behavioural reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Disaster rejected: large fire in French chemical plant deleted
The large fire in a particularly dangerous chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been removed. This was reported to the Normandy prefecture of the AFP news agency on Friday. The fire had broken out at night at Thursday.
According to the authorities, no hazardous substances should have been released. The samples taken give no reason to worry, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said on Friday morning at a press conference. No one was injured during the incident. The firefighter was in operation with about 200 discharge vehicles.
Schools and nurseries were closed
Residents were invited not to leave their houses. Buildings around 500 metres were evacuated, schools and nurseries remained closed on Thursday.

In the past, the chemical factory provided headlines - for example, when the gas methanthiol escaped from a leak in 2013 and the surrounding area smelled extensively to fade eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's sewage system.
Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The sister of the Prime Minister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first Parliament meeting after the suspension of the forced break on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country on 31 October without EU agreements should not respond to his demands for amendments to the Brexit Agreement, but it is unclear how he wants to achieve that.
About Cox, who had committed himself to the UK's stay in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: "The best way to honor Jo Cox's memory and return to one country would be to carry out the EU's departure." Cox had been murdered by a right-wing extremist during the referendum campaign in 2016.
Male of attacks by Oslo and Utöya will be revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a monument will be revealed in Norway on Saturday to honor the victims. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the Iron Roses) consists of about 1,000 iron rose reproductions. They recall the roses that thousands of people had laid in the days and weeks after the attacks before the Dome in Oslo.
At the same place, the project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud will be unveiled - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims. The opening is expected among others Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit.
On July 22, 2011, right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik had first fired a car bomb in the Oslo government district and shot tens of participants in a holiday camp of the Youth Organization of the Social Democratic Worker Party, following the Utöya island. 77 people were killed during the attacks.
Iran releases British tankers
The UN general debate did not solve Iran's conflict. But there is now a less problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran could go back to the sea. It could be a puzzle in the peace plan of Iran's President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in the street of Hormus in Iran since mid July is back in international waters. After release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on the way to Dubai, as the Stena Bulk shipping company told.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now travelling for medical examinations to Dubai, explains shipowner Erik Hånell. By noon the ship had left the Iranian waters. "Beautiful it's over," he said to the Swedish television station SVT.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London described the establishment of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to impair the freedom of the seas. We work with our international partners to maintain maritime transport and international law," said a communication on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had established the tanker on 19 July under the accusation of disrespect for the rules of the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released in early September. The remaining 16 crew members are well-earned in the circumstances, said Hånell. They would have been professional in the face of the difficult and exciting situation in the past ten weeks. The shipowner is now working to bring them back to their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in British Gibraltar, after the establishment of the "Stena Impero": at the beginning of July there was a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was supposed to have been intended for Syria, placed on the chain. According to the authorities, the delivery was contrary to EU sanctions against the country of war Syria. The British had received the indication of the ship from the United States.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Assuming it was a trade business to release the "Stena Impero", London vehemently returned.
The Hormus road is one of the most important seaways in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the world's oil exports are shipped through the seas. The tensions in the region have increased dramatically over the past few months. Trade shipping has been invaded in the conflict between the USA and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Teheran and Washington, the nuclear dispute is in the hands of both countries. The Americans reject the Iranian leadership to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. In 2018, the United States had left the international nuclear agreement alone, which would prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time stop its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has put pressure on the leadership in Teheran with massive economic sanctions against the country in order to force a stricter and extended agreement to other areas. Iran has resisted pressures so far.
Because of the dispute about the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the United States is working on a coalition for military protection of trade ships in the region.
Iran's President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for security and peace in Hormus Street at the UN Assembly in New York. With the "Coalition of Hope" initiative for the Persian Gulf, Iran wanted to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf together with the Arab Gulf States and without foreign protection powers.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined as a "war winner". In view of the criminal duties imposed by President Donald Trump on Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to redistribute. Financial leaders of Asian companies considering moving their production from China to another country, India in a UBS survey is one of the preferred alternatives. This is, of course, not only to the uncertainties of the Chinese-American trade war. With a giant pool of young workers and an internal market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to have a more important role to play in the globally wide-ranging production chain.
Now, however, India itself has reached Trump’s focus. Devaluating the Haudegen in the White House as the "Kingdom of Customs", America has withdrawn from the emerging country at the beginning of June the trade advantages for 2000 products. The United States prohibits high tariffs for India and demands better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirit drinks, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of trade wars, frictions with India are, of course, just a sideways. In addition, America is looking at the world’s largest democracy through the security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington combine the concern about China’s power claims in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a savage of American criminal customs is unlikely to attack India. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just entered a second five-year term, is likely to be safe.
However, the problem lies in another place: the empirically hardened theory that open markets are accelerating economic development has a difficult position in the Socialist Republic of India. Even under modei. Its reform ambition focuses mainly on the bureaucratic madness, which for too long suffocated any entrepreneurial spirit in the public state. Companies now receive faster building permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more greedy insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions for liquidating any companies with high debts seems faster.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic perspective in India, much has turned to the better in the first five years of fashion. But this is not true in trade policy. Of which, protecting internationally low-competitive companies from foreign suppliers, the national conservative government even created new barriers.
In the west, the Nimbus of the energy reformer, which radically renews his country in economic terms, is due to the fact that the charismatic Prime Minister knows all too well what vocabulary Western managers like. In the core of the "India First" lawyer has never withdrawn from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to dismantle anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive thanks to the separation of their industries are among the nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party's tribal voters and condemn this short-term policy.
Compilation of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
According to a report, the former French president Jacques Chirac is expected to be joined in Paris next week. The former head of State will be buried on Monday at the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital, the AFP news agency, calling on the Chiracs family. The funeral will take place in the close family circle. For Sunday a public funeral in the Paris Invalidendom was held, as the media reported.
The competitors brought to the goal: Dabo is the first secret hero of the light athletic World Cup
The world's peak was long in the goal when heartwarming scenes were played in the cooled Khalifa International Stadium. In the first run of men over 5,000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to swing dangerously. He could hardly keep himself on his legs more than 300 meters from the target, in an unhealthy position, when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country Guinea-Bissau suddenly swept him down and supported him the last half of the stadium round into the target. But the forces were still sufficient for both to stop the accompanying watch after the target run. As if the scene had not been enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he drew the attention of the gathering journalists completely unexpectedly. Shy he first went out, didn't want to talk about his heroship at all. Finally, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he had noticed that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help one of the passionate fellows. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited for the World Cup. Under normal circumstances he shouldn't even have started. "That's why I am proud to walk here for my country," he said.
He did so in the evening with great emphasis - and much more intense than he would have thought. Because this hero will be remembered. Especially Dabo even left his competitor Busby in the goal and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, well five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega who won this course. At the end it had nothing to do with it, because the busby only with much help came to the goal was disqualified precisely for that reason at the end of the world's Leichtathletik-Verband.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and is studying there in Lisbon, was here to set up a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, this was 18:10.87 minutes, but he was disappointed: "I wanted to walk 17:55 minutes. I was already under 18 minutes." However, only in training, the best times do not count.
Million Mash: Egyptians are equipping for Wild Protest Day
In Egypt, security measures have been strengthened in advance of possible government-critical protests. In the centre of Cairo there was an increased police presence on Friday. Several metro stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir place were blocked.
In recent days, the police had reinforced their road controls and partially searched pedestrian phones for news and photos related to protests. Hundreds had been arrested according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opponent of Al-Sisi
Last weekend there had been protests with hundreds of participants in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura. They opposed the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, critic of corruption and mismanagement. There had been no such open protest against political leadership in Egypt for years. The Egyptian builder and actor Mohammed Ali, living in Spanish exile, who took the demonstrations with video embassies on Facebook, has called for a "million march" for today's Friday in central places in the country. Ali calls for a "popular revolution". Although for most young Egyptians, the man is not "gutter, because he was a subcontractor for the Armed Millions, but his messages are coming.
The number of arrests in connection with the protests continued to increase according to two observer groups. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) had more than 1.570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Watch (HRW) talked about more than 2,000 arrests. These figures could not be confirmed in the first place.
Random arrests
Many people were "willingly arrested", "only because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time", told HRW, calling for lawyers who were arrested. According to their lawyers, the charges against the arrested range from "spreading false information" to membership in a "terrorist association". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, they interviewed and searched security forces in uniform, but also in civil clothing, according to HRW's indications, also arbitrarily Passengers.
HRW also criticized the censorship in the North African country. Thus, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online dealers: should be able to spend returns more easily
For online dealers, many back-send packages are lost goods. Around 20 million returns land on the garbage. However, there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online dealers such as Amazon and Zalando a way to give back sent products instead of destroying them.
While companies could not be exempted from sales taxes on Sachsen donations, the Ministry stated that the Green Federal Group, on Friday, reported on the newspapers of the Radio Media Group, could put the market value of the unselling returns so low that they would have to pay no or little turnover tax.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had found that the federal citizens would return every sixth package on the Internet on orders. Around four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - then landed in the waste. They would spend the companies additionally, according to the current legal situation, because the financial authorities value property donations like a turnover on which the sales tax is then applied.
President of the Green Group Katrin Göring-Eckardt asked Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to make it clear with an order that companies can evaluate non-sale products accordingly and donate them free of charge to non-profit organizations. Companies should be able to rely on not to be punished for donation. This applies not only to online trade but also to other shops from fashion store to construction market.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", will be auctioned soon.
For Branczik, Banksy's work stresses "the restoration of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world to the fundamentality of animals and tribes". From Saturday, the painting at Sotheby's in the UK capital will be issued until it will be auctioned on 3 October. It is estimated to be 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in southwestern Britain, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had re-exposed the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29th. On this occasion, the work, which was formerly called "Fragentunde", was renamed "Devolved Parliament" ("Delegated Parliament").
The picture could change the owner for a million dollars.
Last Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, at the first meeting of the lower house after the suspension of a forced break imposed by Johnson by the Supreme Court, had provided a strong exchange of blows with the opposition. Johnson wants to carry out the Brexit already twice postponed on 31 October, if necessary without agreements with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, intervenes in the Brexit debate. In Dover, southeast of England, he painted a picture that represents a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a girl. The work sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors every day when entering the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a "walking in the park"
The violent verbal attacks of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the election campaign before the Brexit referendum 2016, the current controversy is a "walking walk in the park", said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book presentation. "We will enjoy this. We will leave (from the EU) and we will win."
Johnson had severely attacked Brexit opponents in Parliament in recent days and accused them, among other things, of "betrayal" to the people.
Cummings said that the only way to rest is to finally respect the British's decision to leave the EU, and it is not surprising that the people were excited that the UK had still not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the crowded mood, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday. "We should speak with respect," said a statement. "And we should also listen."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for Uno intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict in his first appearance before the UN Assembly.
Otherwise, another war between the nuclear forces of Pakistan and India would be likely, Khan said on Friday at the Uno-General debate in New York. "If this runs bad, one hopes for the best but are prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have been responsible for Kashmir. "You should have prevented that."
India and Pakistan have led three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers have each dominated part of Kashmir, another part of China. At the beginning of August India had withdrawn the status of autonomy of the Indian Kashmir region, thereby increasing the tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo demand the fall of the Egyptian president al-Sisi.
In response to the current protests in Egypt, the government responds hardly. It shoots the population with sharp ammunition, more than 2000 prisoners join in prisons with the 60,000 political prisoners already sitting there. Protesting was never dangerous in Egypt. But since the take over of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus has made every effort to avoid a scenario like at the time of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the poor economic situation. Poverty, unperspectiveness and the feeling of being suffocated by the own government driven millions on the road. And this is a problem that the regime of el-Sisi does not control, no matter how hard it is against opponents. The situation has even worsened.
Today, every third person in Egypt lives below the poverty limit. Since 2016 the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. Who wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, has to decide who he is financed: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for oppression, but also the largest economic player. The military builds streets, houses, football stages, produces food and much more. That was already before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. Critical it will always be, when large parts of the population have difficulties to afford a bottle of water at all.
Tüv tests in the terminal: BER-Chef: No more "show stops" for capital airports
Two months have been examined whether the complex plant bracket works in interplay with BER fire protection. Operators are satisfied with the course. However, the Tüv is not yet finished on BER.
After large-scale Tüv tests at the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain,” said Supervisory Board Director Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control panel.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful completion of the test, but also said that there were still deficiencies in the terminal. "We have many detail themes, but we don't have a real showstopper." He assured that the schedule until commissioning still contains buffers.
However, there is evidence that the time reserve is no longer likely to be too large. The construction completion notice is now to be submitted to the construction office during the first quarter of 2020, at the beginning of the year, which was planned for this autumn.
Hundreds of deficiencies in power cables are still to be addressed, and the Tüv intends to review them by February. "In order to create the conditions for operating operations in this area, intensive efforts must continue to be made to address the deficiencies," said a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases there are missing evidence, less new cables. There is also no release for all the dusts on which the cable trails are hanging. The airport manager expects it to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, fire protection does not work satisfactoryly at the transition to the station under the terminal. The problems had led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time, it is about smoke cuts that fall down in a fire like a canvas so that the smoke does not spread. They are driving too far down. 36 engines must therefore be exchanged. Then in the beginning of the year new tests with hot gas smoke are to be carried out.
Problems with fire protection and further construction deficiencies and planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Initially, it had to start operating in 2011. Costs increased since the beginning of 2006 from two billion to approximately 6.5 billion euros for opening next year.
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has risen significantly since then, the managers plan to expand the airport. This is why a special meeting of the Supervisory Board will take place on 18 October, as President Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Financial Director Heike Fölster switches to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, staff manager Manfred Bobke from Camen retires next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She put the airport finances on fixed feet.
Chemnitz: Machines for Drugs Explosed - Police captures man
He needed money for drugs - and for this he chased some machines in the Chemnitzer city area! Now the offender is finally in jail!
In the past two years, the number of cigarette and parking tickets exploded in Chemnitz and the region has increased sharply.
After two explosions at the end of May, the police attacked a 33-year-old German on the Bürgerstraße and on the Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation of explosive explosions in a unit of action with a particularly serious case of theft led by the Chemnitzer Criminal Police, not only this suspicion of the 33-year-old was confirmed."
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old chemistry now confessed eight acts.
The police spokesman: "With the prey he apparently financed his drug addiction."Only four times, the bomber had blown parking cards on the Bürgerstraße between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019.
The total damage caused is at least EUR 60 000!
The Automatic Bomber is now in custody, and the police investigation against him continues.
It is possible that he was also responsible for further automatic spreads in Chemnitz and neighbouring districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
In the midst of the competition with cheap airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa subsidiary AUA takes over "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", confirmed a press speaker from Austrian Airlines to the APA on Friday. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" had reported about it.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa Billigflyer Eurowings will thus be dissolved de facto. Of the currently seven Eurowings flights, four remain in Vienna. From January 2020 the AUA will take over the "Wetlease", including Eurowings-Personal. In Salzburg, three Eurowings jets will be stationed to fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines to holiday destinations.
The Eurowings-Basis in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA Cross and network planning, said the speaker. The flight time should be adjusted for connection flights. The aim is, on the one hand, to strengthen the Vienna Cross and, on the other hand, to expand the decentralised traffic from the federal countries.
According to AviationNetOnline, Eurowings in Vienna only serve as the "Production Company" for Group Sister AUA. For example, Barcelona and Rome would be operated with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device. Although the boarding product should be adapted to Austrian Airlines's, the pilots and crews are from Eurowings. According to the report, the Eurowings flight starts under AUA flight number will not be completed in Terminal 1, but in the same way as the AUA in Terminal 3.
At Vienna Airport, after the Niki-Pleite, a prize campaign has been launched. The Ryanair daughter Laudamotion announced not to increase the fleet in Vienna to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish cheap airline sends four Ryanair machines and crews to Vienna for this, also in the so-called "wetlease", which the trade union criticized as a circumvention structure for the collective agreement.
The argument by Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary that Lauda will have overrun the AUA in five years responded on Friday to Andreas Otto, the AUA Board of Directors: "We stay number one at the site in five, six or ten years".
Queen's granddaughter Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four is married. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: In the Italian holidays at the beginning of the month Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) should have stopped the hand of his friend Princess Beatrice (31). This was announced by the palace on Thursday.
"We are extremely pleased to announce our engagement. We are both so happy to start this adventure together and can hardly expect to be actually married," said the couple, who has been together since October 2018, in the official communication.
And further: "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us very much in the coming years full of love and happiness."
Sister Eugenie cut the pictures
The official engagement photos have taken her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also published immediately on her Instagram account.
A Royal Festival
The wedding is scheduled to take place in 2020. More information about the date, location and everything else will be announced by the palace in the coming months.
But it is certain that the marriage of the number nine of the British throne and the real estate mogul will be similar to the marriage of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really triggers a heart weakness or an infarction? Hamburgers now want to look at the inheritance of 9000 healthy and ill people.
With the analysis of the inheritance of 9000 people, Hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to find the causes of cardiovascular diseases more detailed.
The research project was the largest of this kind in the German-speaking area, announced the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) on Friday. The Kühne Foundation promotes the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, Davos High Mountain Hospital, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy diet are among the main risk factors that can affect cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is only insufficiently known. Now, the scientists want to compare the full inheritance of 8000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients of the University Heart and Vessel Centre at UKE.
At present, more than 4000 of the 20,000 relevant human genes are known as possible pathogenic changes in DNA - so-called mutations -, said the clinic. Every year about 200 were added.
The aim of the five-year project is, according to the initiators, to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart weaknesses and heart attacks. The data could also be useful in the research of other folk diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, Head of the University Centre for Heart and Vessels. New findings on interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidneys and cancer are possible.
The President of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there was a firm willingness to use the data for the research of other diseases. The Foundation's clinic in Davos has been dealing with allergy in particular. Now a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine should be created at the medical campus there, and a professorship for bioinformatics should be created. In order to justify his commitment, the logistics operator living in Switzerland said that he had been operated at the open heart in Hamburg three years ago and very grateful.
The biosamples of healthy participants come from Hamburgers who are also involved in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 volunteers, this is, according to the clinic, the largest local health study in the world. In the case of inheritance decryption, strict attention is paid to the protection of anonymized data, the scientists assured. It is a petabyte (1000 terabyte) to data," said Holger Moch from the University Hospital Zurich.
According to UKE, the human heritage can be decrypted within 24 hours. The pure cost of it is 1300 euros. The first gene sequence worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, has cost several hundred million euros. The study is scheduled to start on 1 October, and all 9000 samples will be analysed at the end of 2020. The first results are expected in the year.
Nigerian police release hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, the police have released more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Coran school. According to information from residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the partially minor victims, as the police spokesman Yakubu Sabo told. "The victims were abused. Some of them claimed to have been raped by their teachers," Sabo said.
The boys had been held under the pretext of being taught and "healed" in the Qur'an. Indeed, the guardians had been held by their teachers under "the most disgusting and inhumane conditions", Sabo said. About a hundred students, including children aged nine, had been chained in a small room.
According to the report, the Koran school had been for about ten years. The authorities would have drawn attention to repeated irregularities in the facility. The parents would have been shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Koran school, Sabo said. They had not been aware of the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to police.
In most Muslim northern Nigeria there are many private Koran schools, replacing the often lacking state institutions. People in the region are suffering from frequent attacks of armed gangs. According to UN refugee relief agencies, more than 40,000 people have fled across the border in the neighbouring state of Niger over the last ten months.
Chained and tortured: Nigerian police release 400 children from school
In a school in northern Nigeria, police officers have released nearly 400 students from terrible conditions. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that indicate torture," said police speaker Yakubu Sabo in Kaduna City.
There the children had been discovered on Thursday after a note in an Islamic school. The conditions there had been "human indignity". The officials arrested the head of school and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were held in their school like slaves and put in chains. Some were sexually abused. Television images showed mager and injured students in a noticeably poor condition of health.
World Football Choice: Further accusations after Messis and Klopps
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the Fifa World Football Association awards the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi, it is the sixth honor and thus record.
After the captain of Nicaragua declared that he had never voted in the World Football election, from other countries charges come to the Fifa. Egypt was not valued at all - with a curious justification.
In recent years, many things have proved to be reluctant at the Fifa: the World Cup awards, the dubious plans of their President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. However, the Fifa World Football Election has not hitherto been suspected of being unclean - given that the voting-right national trainers and the national team captains of member associations are often more consistent with sympathy than with objective assessments.
But after the captain of Nicaragua had already complained that he had not voted at all, there are further inconsistencies: Egypt is complaining that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible polling list.
The Fifa apologize to the fact that "the signatures on the ballot forms had been made in large letters and were therefore not valid". The Egyptian Association has been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without answer.
Sudan's Trainer also surprised
While the situation in the case of Egypt is comprehensible, the Sudanese Association states that trainer Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally valued: with Lionel Messi in place one, Virgil van Dijk in two and Sadio Mané in three. According to Fifa, the vote was also taken in the same way, with signatures and official stamps of the Sudanese association.
He also claimed that Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera had not voted for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the information about my voice is wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan Football Association simply voted on his behalf.
The report came from the Association on Friday: True, but of course it was not intentional. The completed election documents were "inadmissibly" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, said it in a communication from the Association. However, it was actually chosen by the second captain Manuel Rosas. "We assume responsibility for the administrative error," said the Communication. However, both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte would have voted for Messi, "as it stands in the official list of FIFA".
The other cases allow the Fifa to examine in an investigation now, but stresses that the election process was supervised externally by the PriceWaterhouseCoopers consulting company. As long as Lionel Messi remains the uncontested winner of the World Football Elections - and Jürgen Klopp World Trainer of the Year.
Ukraine-Affair: Rank High Republicans speak for official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have openly spoken for an official investigation against the US president and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican Governor of the US Federal State Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here, the facts are determined by the facts that are detected." He wanted to know more about the Whistleblower cases before action is taken.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations. These had shown that Trump had repeatedly asked the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate the activities of the democratic candidate and former vice-president Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump Biden observed "seit years".
To date, the Republicans have held back with criticism of Trump for the Whistleblower case, only a few have shown discomfort for that. Scott's statements are now a first sign of this in Trump's party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already turned several times against Trump's policy, such as the relief of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
As another high-ranking Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also voted for the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation," said Baker. "The right approach and responsibility for the Congress is now to investigate the matter and go to the bottom of it."
Scott and Baker, as governor of the U.S. states, have formally failed to participate in the trial against Trump, which is decided at the Congress. Therefore, their statements are particularly symbolic. However, the first senators of the Republicans have also made critical statements about the situation. Romney, for example, who represents the U.S. state in the second Chamber of Parliament, said that the case was "extremely devastating, deeply devastating".
The affair could lead to an investigation in the opening of a procedure against Trump, and the democrats in the House of Representatives have announced that they are advocating him to abuse power for foreign intervention for their own political benefit.
With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could strive for a so-called impeachment. However, the decision on actual repealing was made in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore small. So far no US President has been removed by an impeachment procedure.
Was torturers on board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men were arrested in Sicily, allegedly raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she had illegally controlled the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Lybia refugees on board. After violent protests and international criticism - including by Austrian Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was revoked after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now new serious accusations against rackete are being made. So three men who are accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived with "Sea-Watch 3" in Italy. The suspects have been held in a reception camp in Messina, Sicily, after migrants have recognized their punishment in Italy. "We can't exclude this, but we don't even have secured information about it," said "Sea Watch" spokesperson Ruben New builders of the German Press Agency.
In mid-September, the police reported that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured and even murdered. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and exposed to horror - by repeated and constant physical violence," it was said in the communication.
NGOs and helpers now point out that they cannot know exactly who comes to the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports," said New builders. Torture is one of the main reasons why people flee from Libya. It is therefore very likely that there are also perpetrators on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this be followed."
Italy's judge, Matteo Salvini, former internal minister, asked Rackete, who is still being investigated in Italy for aid to illegal immigration, to apologize immediately.
Musk strives to deliverance record at Tesla
Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given his electric car group strong boost with the prospect of new record numbers on the stock exchange.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand is strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter. The challenge is to quickly bring the cars to the customer. To that end Tesla must offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of trade with more than six percent. The price has not been so high for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered more than 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs record to achieve its high targets. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. In the current and next quarter, six-digit numbers are required. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is requested, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
US Budget Dispute: Renews only one bridge financing
The new financial year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the American Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in the ceilings for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States will be present once again before the new fiscal year beginning on 1 October. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision it would have come to a Shutdown on Monday at midnight, a partial closure of the federal administration. President Trump has to put the decision into force.
Dismissed Shutdown
The federal government is now temporarily financed at the level and in accordance with the priorities of the spending plans for the financial year 2019 that will end on Monday to the end. This is because the Congress has not been able to agree in time on the 12 spending laws which allocate funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the federal administration cannot first benefit from the expenditure framework extended from 1.3 Bio. to 1.4 Bio. $ for the new financial year.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, but the spending laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chances in the Senate dominated by the Republicans. On the other hand, the Senate also has ten of the twelve spending plans more or less ready, which are hardly qualified by the majority.
In the Senate, the Republicans seem to try to compel $12 billion for the construction of the wall, one of President Trump’s major priorities. The Democrats interfere with the construction plans and their financing, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute about the construction of the wall had already escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day Shutdown.
At the wall building the ghosts differ
At present, it is unclear how the parties want to get closer to this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the next seven weeks, an extension of transitional financing beyond 21 November is not excluded.
In the light of the continuing inability of the Congress to agree on the twelve spending laws in time, and the associated risk of Shutdown, ideas to automate the process to popularity. S. 1877 to avoid Shutdowns would automatically continue the financing of the federal administration at the level of the previous year, stop the travel activities of parliamentarians and hold their wages back until the new annual spending plans are presented.
France allows artificial fertilisation for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilization is intended to be open to women and lesbians living alone in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted with a large majority for a government bill that allows all women to use in vitro fertilization, thereby increasing the demand for anonymous seeds.
In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right camp had warned that in the future many "children without a father" could grow up. The French bishop conference is also against innovation.
The new regulation is the core element of a bioethics law, which the Minister of Health, Agnès Buzyn, defended as a "chance" for society. It is the modern family in which children with only one parent or homosexual parents exist. According to their idea, the cost of artificial fertilization for all women is to be borne by social insurance.
Prohibited fertilisation with sperm of dead husband
On the other hand, with a limited majority, the National Assembly rejected an amendment to give widows access to the sperm of their dead husband for artificial fertilization. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, artificial fertilization is allowed "post-mortem". In Germany, in the past, there were cases where women complained in vain about the release of the sperm of a dead man. The opponents of the incident in Paris argued that a child such a child would then bear a "specially heavy fate".
Many members of the government party La République en Marche (The Republic in Movement, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had expressed their support for artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow would be imposed a "double mourning" if their husband's death would remain unfulfilled with her child's wish.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow can be fertilized with the sperm of an unknown in the future, but not with that of his own partner.
To date, artificial fertilization in France is permitted only to heterosexual couples who cannot testify to children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in summer that the parenthood would remain prohibited.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Climate Compensation: Calls for flight levy for United States will be louder
There is a lot of fleeing at universities, which is why the country wants to make a climate levy in the future. The rectors say they don't have any money for it, but now they are also under pressure internally.
The universities should also be limited when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Street Schools
The debate on a climate tax on flights from universities and universities, which had been postponed before the summer break, is recurring. After the National Rectors Conference had sceptically responded to a corresponding advance from the green-black coalition, the plans now receive support from universities. In a joint statement, doctoral candidates from six universities in Baden-Wurtemberg and a educational university for compensation for service flights, which is the first step "immediately necessary", at the same time there must be a broad debate on the avoidability of flights, as stated in their opinion. The Cabinet decision originally planned in July is still on ice, since the CDU has still not approved the presentation of the Greens.
Russia re-establishes North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB secret service, the prisoners were reported to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time there was a shooting change between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and one North Korean were injured, and the fisherman later suffered his severe injuries.
The Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food deficiency. The North Korean fishermen were traveling in Russian territorial waters, where the Russian Coast Guard, according to its own information, is driving patrols to protect their marine biological resources.
30 000 ink fish seized
During the re-checks, 30,000 ink fish were discovered and confiscated on the boats. In addition, the data were confiscated after three fishermen and two motor boats and brought to Nachodka and Posjet at Wladiwostok.
The Russian Fisheries Authority had not issued any fishing licences to North Koreans this year, according to complaints made by local operators. According to the media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been arrested there this year.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the far-eastern Primorje region, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained about high environmental damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow synthetic nets banned in Russia. They would also bring small living creatures out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea where they needed 200 years to be destroyed.
In the future only 18,000: USA lowers the asylum ceiling
The "greatest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police officers in the White House.
The richest country of the earth is shattering against protection seekers: As the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Washington confirms, the ceiling for the legal access of refugees will continue to be lowered.
The U.S. government wants to reduce the already historically low limit for the reception of new refugees again. In the marketing year 2020, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, no more than 18,000 people will be left to the country, as the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs has stated. In the coming marketing year, the limit is still 30,000.
President Donald Trump's government has drastically reduced the welcome of protection seekers from all over the world in recent years. Under the predecessor government of Barack Obama, there had been much higher reception limits.
The level of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the U.S. refugee programme in 1980. However, the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the U.S. "the most merciful and generous nation in history", a wording that strongly reminds of the language use of the U.S. President.
A "responsible handling" of refugees aims to allow refugees to return to their home countries to help them rebuild there, Trump explained. For his hard course in migration policy he receives a lot of support from followers, but there is also massive criticism.
A major point of dispute is the border with Mexico that wants to lock down Trump. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a temporary link between the current action and the current internal policy developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selenskyj affairs and a potentially threatening procedure of deletion.
The U.S. government, as presented by the Foreign Office, intends to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus endangered, as stated in the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on the other hand, a maximum of 1500 refugees from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
In particular, the United States wants people from this "northern triangle" of Central America to apply for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has only concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras in order to limit immigration at the US southern border with Mexico.
Court orders the release of Orang-Utan from Zoo
An orang-utan woman was transferred from the former Buenos Aires Zoo to a reception station for human apes in the United States at the request of the Argentine justice. The "Sandra", born in 1986 in the Rostock Zoo, was granted the rights of a "non-human person", so their release was mandatory. The animal was brought to Dallas on Thursday night by direct flight, but not as a passenger, but in the cargo room, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez declared.
Since the 53 kilograms of heavy human affes are unable to adapt to life in the wilderness, they are expected to live in the open-end of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are 21 more orang utans and 31 chimpanzees, among them "Bubbles", formerly a pet by Popstar Michael Jackson. But before moving into Florida, "Sandra" has to pass a 40-day quarantine in the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the U.S. state of Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, "Sandra" spent several years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen, before being moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014 process of "Sandras" fundamental rights has contributed to transforming the Buenos Aires Zoo into an eco park. By 2023 there will be a research and education centre to preserve biodiversity.
Rekord for Swiss extreme mountain climbers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The Dani Arnold, the extreme mountain climber, has been lucky at the almost 3000 meters high Grand Zinn in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, double soil or other means, the Swiss enforced the 550 meters high north wall of the Great Zin in a new record time.
Dressed with jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute dizziness, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the lifting. He thus subordinated the old best mark by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now record holder at the Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important northern European walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, the US sports product manufacturer Nike has recorded a significant increase in profits. Net profits increased to $1.4 billion in the past quarter (now EUR 1.3 billion). This is 25 percent more than in the previous year, as the Group announced on Tuesday. The reason for this is the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor is direct to its customers online.
In the three-month period until the end of August, sales increased to $10.7 billion. The Nike sales figures most strongly increased by 22 percent in China. Thus, the Beaverton Group in the U.S. state of Oregon also benefited from its approach to direct contact with consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps in the People's Republic.
Financial Director Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to promote the "digital transformation" of the sports goods manufacturer with strategic investments, thereby expanding its competitive advantage. Investors were pleased to respond to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sports goods manufacturer increased by more than five per cent.
Lifelong stadium ban on racism in Italy
Due to racist comments on football professional Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the club of the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong stadium ban on a fan. The Brazilian defender Jesus had been impuned by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action. "@officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. proud to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old who has been playing at AS Rome since 2016.
The club responded late Thursday. He reported the fan's account to Instagram and the police. Moreover, the Roma supporters should never again visit a game of the club, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly scandalize racist shocks against black players rival teams. "We can't have racism in society or in sport. In Italy the situation has not improved, and that is very serious. You have to identify the responsible and throw them out of the stages," Fifa President Gianni Infantino said on the weekend. The occasion of the statement was racist songs at the First League Party between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florence on Sunday.
However, even about the followers of Juventus Turin there had been last discussions. The Italian authorities have now banned the stadium by 38 fans of recorder Juventus Turin. Four of them are expected to no longer enter the stadium for a ten-year period, the police informed. The rest of them are therefore subject to bans of four to seven years.
The fans are in connection with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra fan groups around Juventus. The twelve are accused, among other things, of severe extortion, money laundering and private violence. The club had put the investigation into the role with an announcement last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra leaders should be behind the black trade with tickets. They would have controlled the ticket trade for the fan curve "military" and would have extorted Juventus employees to get to cheaper cards.
Generation Z: Are they really different from generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, generation Z is political - whole years are thought of with clever names. If you look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the individual sense of life of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" This call officially launched the crab catch at Lake Gucheng in Gaochun on 21 September, which also opened the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Department of Public Work of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern exit of Nanjing in the province of Jiangsu, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and is also located here the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ideal environmental conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water surfaces and 50 percent fields." The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all conditions to become rich.
The people in Gaochun have already started crap breeding in the early 1990s. Over time, the crap industry has developed into a powerful industry that has provided high income and has become an important part of Gaochun's economic development. In recent years, Gaochun has actively sought to develop a large scale, ecological and scientific development of crap breeding as well as technology-based crap breeding. And the city has taken care of the promotion of more efficiency in agriculture and the income of farmers.
In recent years, Gaochun has undergone a reform on "distribution of power, optimization of administration and government services" and has carefully set up the service network for "authorizations under one roof, a law enforcement team, a network of services, a platform for credit awards", which aims to optimise the environment for permits, services and development in full.
Gaochun fully exploits the advantages given on site by connecting to the southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui and exploits the development area and its position as an international "Slow City" as a guideline for the establishment of smart high-end production companies, companies for biomedical and medical technology, energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and health sectors and from companies for organic agriculture leading in the "3+2" area. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the development of a national tourism area covering all areas and of tourist sites of national importance. Gaochun's environmental and cultural resources have been integrated into Gaochun's landscape, the state of buildings for civil services and public service, the energy development of the areas "Tourism +" and "+ Tourism" and the development of cultural tourism at a high quality level.
Conflict between Iran and the USA: Ruhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after his return from the United Nations Assembly, spoke of a alleged offer by the United States to lift sanctions. In return, the United States would have proposed an end to all sanctions for discussions with the Tehran leadership," Ruhani said on his official website.
However, US President Donald Trump disagreed with the Iranian colleague on Twitter: "I wanted Iran to lift the sanctions imposed against him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the situation as follows: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and had urged a meeting to take place. "And America says that I am lifting the sanctions," added Ruhani. The kind of sanctions that should be terminated were to be debated. "And they have clearly said that we are lifting all the sanctions."
However, this advance would not have taken place in an acceptable way, criticized Ruhani. In view of the current sanctions and the "toxic atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one can predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York. The background was the hope of Europeans to save the nuclear agreement negotiated with Russia and China with Iran, which would prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France's President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel at the edge of the UN Assembly, had expressed the hope that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump.
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 after-quakes
After Western Turkey has been shocked by two earthquakes in the shortest time, fear of a disaster is growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake on the previous day, almost 200 afterbearings have occurred, said the Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay on Friday. This raises the concern for a disaster.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged. The strength's earthquake 5.8 on Thursday had shaken the Marmara region before Istanbul and caused panic in the millions of metropoles. Now the government intends to use a Commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years Turkey had not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is constantly ignored. Every year poorly built dwellings fall, among other things made by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
Urban planners such as the famous architect Mücella Yapici have for years warned that large open areas, registered as refuges in the centre, have been built for a long time. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük earthquake in August had the building engineers' chamber of Istanbul warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The Epicenter of the Thursday earthquake was located in Marmaramean in front of Silivri District and in about seven kilometres depth, as the Civil Protection Authority told Afad. A small after-stage caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
The Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu told on Twitter that injured or damage had not initially been reported. The TRT state station showed people who ran out of the houses in panic. Students were brought out of the buildings in the Silivri district for security reasons. Some students were crying, as can be seen on pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly endangered by earthquakes. Under the Marmaramean lies a section of the so-called North Anatolic disorder, which marks the border between the eurasian and the anatolic earth plate. Turkey is constantly shaken by earthquakes. One of the most fatal was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time, more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of strength could threaten 7.1 to 7.4. But when it comes to the earthquake, it is unclear. During the earthquake on Thursday it happened again to the west of the country and Istanbul.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have so-called Go-Bags packed up with everything they need, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth wakes up. When the next big earthquake comes, be unclear.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered minor damage. The Istanbul Mayor Ecrem Imamoglu followed the development of the Istanbul Catastrophe Coordination Centre (Akom). According to his information, two mosque minarets crashed in the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warning for post-beefing in Istanbul
In the social networks, many people reported panic. Buildings were whacked. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Phone lines had been interrupted. It was more intense than that of Tuesday, a user writes. The head of the Turkish Red Half Moon, Kerem Clinic, warned about afterbearing via Twitter. He called people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to official data, the date of the earthquake is indicated at 13.59 o'clock (loctal time). Only a few minutes after the first earthquake, according to CNN Turkey, there was a afterbeat with a strength of 4.0 on the judge scale.
Only on Tuesday had an earthquake of strength 4.6 shaken the Turkish Marmara region - it was to be felt until Istanbul. Its epicenter had also been located in Marmaramean west of the million-metropoles, said the civil protection authority Afad on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that led to headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a serious earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe it will eventually be unloaded - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the Earthquake is now a warning. It would have become more likely, he said to CNN Türk. "This could be the signs of a larger earthquake," says Ersoy to the broadcaster. "Previously or later the great earthquake will also come."
A few weeks ago, there had been an incident - the earthquake also caused great worries in Istanbul. In Albania there had also been a violent earthquake only a few days ago - 68 injured. Also this year the Earth had been shed on the Earth at the Lake Constance.
Parliament: New ignition in Ukraine
Two brittle documents provide new ignition in the Ukraine case for possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible deletion procedure, the US democrats are reinforced: the complaint filed by an anonymous informant about Trump and its controversial telephone address with the Ukrainian President reveals important evidence for investigations against the President. Trump himself again sees himself as the victim of a "hexen hunt". He also doubted the credibility of the Whistleblower.
USA: Passenger locked up from United Airlines in toilet - Airlines redirected
Because a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a flight was redirected by United Airlines. The toilet door was blocked during the flight from Washington to San Francisco in 1554, the airline reported US media.
In the event of an extraplanned landing in Denver on Wednesday evening (local time), the woman was finally able to be released from the narrow cabin. About an hour had she been locked in it, US media wrote on appeal to other passengers. For a further flight towards San Francisco, passengers had to switch the machine.
In a video broadcast on the Internet, which is supposed to come from the U.S. media from flight 1554, it is to see how several people try to release the woman. "We are currently working to open the door, ma'am. We will soon get you out, okay?", says a man. The airline has apologize to all passengers. Open first, whether the woman receives compensation.
The Cakerlake: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is invincible.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The Transformation" the British success author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about the Brexit chaos in the UK.
The novel "Die Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will appear in German on 27 November, the Diogenese Publisher (Zürich) announced. It involves the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his previous life, but now at once is the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to implement the people's will and is wildly determined to let nothing and no one stop.
McEwan was quoted with the words: "If the parliament is closed so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment when ministers lie shamelessly like the Soviet leaders, when Brexiteers in high positions just ask the disaster of a no-deal - then a writer has to ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to it: write." From McEwan, the novel "machines like me" was only published in the spring on Artificial Intelligence.
Kafkas, published for the first time in 1915, is a story about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "to an immense unpopular" and is gradually excluded from family and society. "Ian McEwan denies himself before Kafka in order to describe a world that stands in mind," said the Diogenee Verlag.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria's railway infrastructure
11.200 Wagons in Austria and Hungary receive flushing brakes to reduce noise from freight trains. In addition, sections of the railway connections between Graz and Györ and Vienna's New Town and Sopron are modernized and electricized.
According to the EU authorities, this will make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions.
Thomas Cook: All travels cancelled until 31 October
The German travel operator Thomas Cook canceled all travels until 31 October 2019 on a day after his insolvency application. Travel could not be entered for insolvency reasons," the company informed on Thursday evening.
This also includes bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Travel, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen und Air Marin, which are already paid or fully paid. As it stands with travel starting November 1, 2019, the company left open. In consultation with the Insolvency Insurance, the further approach was checked, it said.
Thomas Cook in Germany had joined the UK parent group's sog and had applied for insolvency on Wednesday. The company, including Neckermann travels, Öger Tours and Bucher travels, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurers want to transfer hotels money back from now on
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels abroad, which are currently hosting Thomas-Cook holidaymakers, will receive money from the Zurich insurance. Payments to the hotels are bound by the Zurich condition that holidaymakers are no longer asked for extra payments.
Based on the booking information and without the submission of separate invoices, the hotels in the resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman of the German press agency said. "This is immediately and on condition that Thomas-Cook travellers from these hotels will not be asked to pay individual hotel invoices or otherwise," said spokesperson Bernd Engelien.
The insurance responded to reports from hotel guests who, according to their own information, had been forced to pay their accommodation on site themselves. Some had to put more than 1,000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had strongly criticised this.
How many hotels are affected will be agreed with the insolvent travel provider on Friday, said the insurance speaker. According to Thursday's information, 70,000 Thomas-Cook-Pauschal holidaymakers from Germany were on their way. Zurich Germany has secured the vacation and return of Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the now announced payments to hotels by Zurich insurance only help travellers who are currently on their way. For Thomas-Cook customers who want to fly for the holidays, it looks bad. On late Thursday evening the company announced that all travels would be cancelled until 31 October. This also applies to such bookings that have already been paid.
As it stands about travel with start from November 1, 2019, the company left open. In consultation with the Insolvency Insurance, the further approach is examined. Basically, the Zurich Insurance is responsible for these cases. The sale of new travels is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the Zurich insurer, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about the possibilities of refunding the travel price and claim their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys Sprengmine in Angola
Prince Harry has long continued Lady Diana’s commitment. In Africa he is now walking directly on the tracks of his mother.
Clothed with a blue fragment protection vest, the British Prince Harry in Angola has ignited and destroyed an explosive mine.
Close to a camp of the British Halo Trust near the village of Dirico, he produced the ignition circle on Friday morning before running TV cameras. At a safe distance, the explosives exploded in the savanna landscape without any damage. Although only the Halo Trust destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the bloody conflict for decades in the African country, there are still more than 1,000 mine fields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry then wanted to walk directly in Huambo City on the trails of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same exploder who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to leave the way she went then. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a spacious mine field in 1997 had gone around the world. She had also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day African trip since Monday, starting in the South African tourist metropole Cape Town.
Stocking Brexit Negotiations: The danger of no deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly stated that he would not have a third postponement of Brexit negotiations. But what statements are forever in the polarising British. The recent judgment of the Supreme Court in the UK is floating like a damoclese sword over the blonde sword. His suspension of Parliament to be able to complete its Brexit course until the date of departure has been cancelled at the beginning of this week. And a law adopted by Parliament obliges Johnson to extend bilateral negotiations with the EU by 31 October. However, this had been categorically excluded again and again.
Boris Johnson thinks the deal is still possible
However, the pressure does not seem to pass noticeably to Johnson. In the meantime, when visiting a hospital, he made statements that in the event of non-commissioning he would support an extension of the negotiations by the end of October:
You know, we're going to comply with the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And best with a deal. I'm careful optimistic that this works.
And the time is running away from the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. The EU and the British negotiators still have about six weeks to prevent British withdrawals from the European Union without agreements, but the recent talks have not yet reached a breakthrough. An agreement by the end of October seems to be quite difficult to imagine at present. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, the date of departure will be postponed again. However, the opposition does not trust the Prime Minister’s words.
U.S. Authority: Other deaths caused by e-cigarettes
The number of deaths in connection with the use of e-cigarettes in the United States has increased to twelve. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and likely injured persons in this context, the US Health Authority informed CDC. According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, there were already more than 900 affected, of which about 500 were confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear.
The fear of new protests in Egypt grows
Millions of the videos of Mohammed Ali were shared in online networks. The builder and actor living in Spain calls for a "Volksrevolution". For today's Friday, he called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military that critics are accusing corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes mass disclosures with a million participants in central places in the country.
In any case, the security authorities are alarmed. In the centre of Cairo there was already a reinforced police presence. Several metro stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir place were locked. In recent days, the police had strengthened their street controls and partially searched pedestrian phones for news and photos related to protests.
On 20 September, the demonstrators also gathered around the Tahrir place.
Last weekend, there had been protests with hundreds of participants in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura. There had been no such open protest in Egypt for years. As a result, the security forces responded hardly. According to human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), nearly 2000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them had been arbitrarily arrested - only because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time", HRW informed prisoners in appeal to lawyers.
The organization also criticized the censorship in the North African country. According to this, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The General has ruled the country since 2013, after the democratically elected Islamic President Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, opponents, bloggers and activists have been detained and partially condemned in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs from Greenland expedition back
The polar scientist Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. He was welcomed at his arrival in the Port of Hamburg, among others, by the Skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg over the Atlantic with the race hunt "Malizia".
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had examined and documented the effects of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for the future movement was a blessing, said the Polar scientist. He had waited for years for the young generation to speak. It has been known for decades that the earth is warming. Nevertheless, many acted as if there were a planet B.
"What happens on the sea often takes place under the exclusion of the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the spoiling of the seas. During the expedition, among other things, a drone of Greenland glazing was measured and fished with nets for microplastics, said.
In the context of the Hamburg Climate Week, the Polar scientist from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" for his "Camping for a Sustainable and Respectful Use of the World Seas". "Arved Fuchs is a great example for all of us who are at the heart of the oceans," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. "He is a witness to the changes that have taken place in the Arctic in recent decades."
expensive spaghetti in Rome: tourists paid for noodles 430 Euro
430 euros for two plates spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near Engelsburg in Rome: This seemed to be too much for two Japanese tourists. The bill with 80 euros of drink was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered hot reactions.
"Such cases harm the reputation of Rome. We call on the police to examine whether this is a fraud," asked a speaker of Federagit, the association of the guides in Rome, according to the Roman newspaper Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
Prompt came the reaction of the restaurant owners. The Japanese women had not only ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified themselves. However, this is not taken from the invoice. Also, a drink fee of up to 20 percent of the invoice is normal, said the host.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump could, after the turbulent revelations of the past days, have actually been confronted with a process of deletion, the democrats want to examine this with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the talk is of weeks until a decision is taken.
At the beginning of the scandal, the phone call with the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj is supposed to be monstrous. The Whistleblower's accusation, which finally brought the conversation about national security and democracy of the United States with his complaint to the public: the President abused the power of his office to instrumentalise the government of another country for influence on the 2020 election. He has extorted Ukraine's dependence and thus wanted to force them to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to be understood in the now published copy of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not reproduce the full text. The telephone address of July 25 is only an episode of a much larger story, in which the center of Trump is primarily his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story starts from the public's point of view in May 2019 when Rudy Giuliani's New York Times reports travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the newly elected President Selenskyj, and the lawyer himself knows very precisely that his intentions are sensitive. "We do not interfere in a choice, we interfere in an investigation for which we have the right," he says to the newspaper. It could be thought that it was inappropriate, but "nothing is illegal." Giuliani wants that investigations be pursued in Ukraine, for which there is hardly a basis - "because this information will be very, very helpful to my client and could prove to be helpful to my government."
The lawyer and former New York mayor seem to have infected themselves with right conspiracy fantasies that are fixed on Trump's counter candidate at the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had been conspiring with actors in Ukraine, critics said at that time to build an occasion for Russia's investigations in the United States. However, this accusation was never serious.
It is precisely the investigation that Trump will talk to Selenskyj on the phone in July. The version of Giuliani and the President is: The former Vice-President and at present the candidate for the Presidential candidate of the Democrats, Joe Biden, has, as Ukraine's representative of the Obama government, pushed Wiktor Schokin to dismiss the former Ukrainian Attorney General at the time, in order to stop the investigation of the gas company that he was responsible for, in which the supervisory board of his son Hunter Biden was active. Biden senior had financially extorted Ukraine to hide the corrupt acts of his family.
In fact, when Joe Biden claimed that the Ukrainian Attorney General had to go, the investigation against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Schokin was also accused of deeply corrupt gestures, the US government was not the only Western partner who urged his resignation. Moreover, the Obama government even explicitly supported investigations against the company.
Disorders at Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions at Instagram and Facebook. Therefore, Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain are particularly affected. On the website all disruptions.de users report that Facebook hasn't loaded again and again since about 3.30 p.m.. Instagram also reports the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems affected by the disruption, although not to date to the same extent.
Instagram and Co. often affected by disorders
It is not the first massive disruption this year. In March and July, the services had expired for several hours. As in previous cases, users also use Twitter especially this time to make their trouble air.
Savioured Polish scientists in the Antarctica
Three Polish scientists were rescued from the Antarctic ice by the Chilean Air Force. They were on their way with a sleeve and several miles away from their base when their engine failed. They had luck in the accident - less than an hour the Chilean rescue helicopter needed for the mining.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 a.m. we received the message, just before 10 a.m. we started, and good 20 minutes spàter we were over the hoseboat."
Poland has been operating the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, with 19 scientists working there. Frozen researchers were safely returned to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NEED to be loaded wirelessly
Practical, but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since the last time several new smartphones have come to the market that support wireless charging and sell themselves very well - all the new iPhone-11 models ahead, we would like to remember a study from early July. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature adds battery
Researchers warn against the wireless charging of smartphones. This is extremely harmful to the devices, according to the findings of the Univerity of Warwick. The reason for this is the much greater heat development. If you normally charge a mobile phone via cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. On the other hand, even when the mobile phone is perfectly aligned on the charging pad, the researchers have always measured more than 30 degrees. If the mobile phone is located slightly next to the coil, the temperature is even higher. In addition, the Watt strength of the charging pad increases, which in turn drives the power consumption to the height.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature is a crucial factor for the durability of batteries. Every single degree plays a role. When loading with higher temperatures, the battery does not only lose capacity, but does not last as long as it lasts at all. Thus, the duration of life is lower. The researchers suggest that the smartphone should always be loaded by cable. Since a battery exchange is always connected with high costs for modern smartphones, this is likely to be a useful tip. Apple has lastly even increased the cost of a battery exchange - for all iPhones.
Practical
The technique is extremely convenient: simply put the device on a suitable charging pad - they are already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is loaded without a cowardly cable salt and a difficult plug-in. Since Qi (is for inductive energy transfer) has a global standard, which exceptionally even involves Apple, there are little restrictions. However, according to the researchers, the technology should only be applied in exceptional cases.
Everest-Stau photographer: 13 eight thousand in six months
According to its own data, a Nepalese climber climbed 13 of the world’s top 14 mountains within six months. Normal Purja (36) had reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and thus made a record, his expedition organizer informed.
The former soldier wants to climb every 14 eight thousand in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has once made international headlines: From him comes a photograph of mountain climbers, which have gone virally in spring, standing on Mount Everest snake.
In May, 11 climbers died during the climb in a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the elevation of the 14th Eight Thousand: Currently, the Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. One reason for this is bad weather. At the beginning of the week Purja wrote on Twitter that the Nepalese government wanted to speak with China to allow him to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a pregnant elephant cow, said a police speaker on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned."
The four Kadavers were found in a protected area near the famous and many tourists visited the former rock fortress Sigiriya. According to the police speaker, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, nearly 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously been unharmed. At the same time, about 50 elephants are killed every year. This usually happens when the animals move by villages built near their habitat.
It is estimated that only about 7,000 elephants still live in Sri Lanka. The death penalty is theoretically on their killing.
British oil holders leave Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after it was held by Iran. This was announced by the maritime service Bandar Abbas, according to the IRNA news agency. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had established the tanker under the British flag on 19 July under the guilt of disrespect of the rules of the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in criticism
The responsible Economic Committee of the Lower House wants to examine the number of travelers, Thomas Cook, in a comprehensive manner. It is intended to address the salary packages of the Board of Directors as well as the question of why the British government did not want to help the company that is struggling for survival. "Our interest is the supervision of the company as well as the control by external auditors," said the committee president Rachel Reeves in London. "It is obvious that we have to deal with a bad example of management greed."
According to experts, genes are overestimated in the risk of intestinal cancer
The role of genes in the increased family risk of intestinal cancer has seem to have been overestimated so far. This concludes that researchers from the German Research Centre for Cancer Research (DKFZ) Heidelberg come into a current study. Other risk factors such as family nutritional habits are therefore likely to be more severe than previously assumed. This has consequences for the calculation of the individual risk of intestinal cancer, the DKFZ scientists stress.
Elon Musk lets Tesla shares rise
Musk wrote this in an e-mail to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek". The demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110'000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge is to quickly bring the cars to the customer service. To that end, Tesla must offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla's shares were traded with more than six percent. The price has not been so high for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered more than 95'000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs record to achieve its high targets. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. In the current and next quarter, six-digit numbers are required. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is requested, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Will the British government circumvent Brexit Law? Johnson Retaining
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson stands on the question of whether he is looking for ways of circumventing the most recent law adopted by Parliament against an unregulated Brexit. On Friday he only said to journalists that his government would comply with the law in force.
The law provides that the government should request a postponement of the date of departure, if no agreement had been reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitulation law" which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
On Thursday, former British Prime Minister John Major had expressed the assumption that Johnson could try to use "political shakes" to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedure trick that would shift the entry into force of the law to the time after EU departure.
Johnson said he was aiming for a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is to make an agreement."
Iran apparently drives high uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has increased pressure on the European partners in the fight for the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. "Sorry, the European states show inability or lack of willingness to act," said Rohani on Thursday at a press conference on the edge of the UN Assembly in New York. In the event that they were not to their promises, he proposed "more steps" away from the 2015 agreements of the difficultly negotiated agreement.
The background is the conflict about the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which, in return, contained the commitment of Teheran to normalise economic relations. In 2018, the United States alone stepped out of the agreement in order to force Iran with "maximum pressure" to a change of course in the Middle East policy considered aggressive. President Donald Trump's government wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher terms and now again imposes severe sanctions against Teheran. Iran responded to this with a re-enrichment of the uranium enrichment restricted by the Treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now used or at least prepared the centrifuges installed in early September with uranium. According to IAEA information, Iran is also preparing the construction of more than 300 more centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans would not be willing to carry their part of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the cost and burden of the US sanctions, said Rohani. However, there will be further discussions that hopefully would be a solution.
Rohani continues to dispute Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the crowd situation changed: Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed the US's assessment that Teheran was responsible for the attack. Initially, the Huthi rebels supported by Iran in Yemen had known their position on the attack, but the United States considered it to be a false commitment. "We have nothing to do with it," said Rohani on Wednesday.
"These accusations must be proved," Rohani said. However, the European leaders had not been able to do so in the discussions with him during the UN General debate. Instead, they would only have called for the rebels in Yemen not to carry out such an attack. Rohani had met Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in recent days.
Before possible discussions with US President Trump would first have to be lifted the extensive sanctions imposed by the US administration, Rohani requested. He urged the government in Washington to rely on a policy of "dialogue and reason".
Comet of other star crossed the solar system
Astronomers are currently watching a comet from the depths of the universe. This was first achieved. The comet allows conclusions on other solar systems.
What was initially just a presumption is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depth of space was baptized after his discoverer on 2I/Borisov and has raised the interest of astronomers all over the world.
The extensive comet was discovered on August 30 by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters diameter. Follow-up observations from various Observatories confirmed not only that it is an unknown comet, but also showed that it is not from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is after 1I/'Oumuamua of 2017 only the second interstellar object that was seen during a passage of our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare opportunity to get out of the vicinity insights into a foreign solar system before it ever disappears. First observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canaries. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is significantly above the typical speeds of objects surrounding the sun," said Davide Farnocchia from the US Space Authority Nasa in a communication.
The comet is, according to the analysis, on a so-called hyperbile track that leads it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced. It is also responsible for the designation and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of his discoverer, the interstellar swinger, who was first led under catalogue number C/2019 Q4, received by it the name 2I/Borisov, the first part of the name indicating that it is the second interstellar object that was discovered in our solar system.
Astronomers have luck: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in the approach. Thus, researchers remain many months for research. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen by medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," said Farnocchia. "Then it will only be observed by October 2020 with larger, professional telescopes".
Several observers have already taken the view of the visitor. For example, a team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, which had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, set the diameter of the heavenly object at 2 to 16 kilometres in a first study. Records from the Gemini Observatory on Hawaii show a clear swivel of the comet.
Researchers from the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already won a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar swinger, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object resembles comets of our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar," said IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of just two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests that these objects could open up a new way of exploring certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how often such tips are. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly capture a planned satellite mission of the European Space Agency Esa.
By 2028, the agency intends to station the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" at a waiting position in 1.5 million kilometers away from the Earth (Germany for comet hunters). According to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, it will either run on an uncontacted, fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellary visitor such as 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing's new Mega-Airport Daxing
Timely before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic, it's time: On the new Mega-Airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger machine of China United Airlines has landed, a special honor for captains and crews.
By 2022, approximately 45 million passengers are expected to be completed annually at the new airport, and it will be 72 million in 2025. China’s president Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China’s latest prestige project is also called "sea stars" because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four start-ups and landing tracks, which will later be extended to seven, and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway transports passengers to Beijing city centre in just 20 minutes.
Even during the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly reported that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been in construction since 2006, has been shifted again and again. In Beijing, however, a first passenger machine landed after four years.
New airplane is scheduled to fly in 2030: in four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in only four and a half hours - of which the UK Space Agency dreams. This, for the 2030s, is a special drive (Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), developed by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, the US broadcaster CNN quoted the agency. "This is the technology that could definitely accomplish," said agency manager Graham Turnock to the broadcaster. "We are talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and the work has already been very advanced."
In order to advance the project, the British Space Agency wants to cooperate more closely with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis takes about 20 hours. The Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 until the end of 2003 and took three to three and a half hours. In 2000, an accident occurred during the launch of a Concorde at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, where all 109 passengers died. Last year, the US aircraft builder Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop, together with the US space authority, a "X-plane". Virgin Galactic also has such developments in the programme.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," says Reaction Engines, among other things, on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft are also available outside the Earth's atmosphere and thus enabled the "nearest generation of truly reusable spacecraft".
Rupture in Washington: Trump wants to track anonymous tips in Ukraine affairs
In the Ukraine case of possible abuse of power by the US President, Donald Trump wants to identify possible spots in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the information to the Whistleblower," said Trump on Thursday before the United Nations mission staff in New York. The person concerned was almost "a spy" and with such ones in the past was "a little different" than today.
This was considered as an intimidating attempt against tip-givers. The event was actually not public. However, on Friday several US media broadcast audio media from the speech. Democrats responded to the President's statement.
The democrats in the US House of Representatives had announced preparations for a withdrawal procedure against Trump on Tuesday. Their accusations were based on the written complaint of an anonymous secret service employee, who raised serious accusations against Trump and its government headquarters. On large public pressure, the paintings of the informant had been made public on Thursday.
As part of his work, the Whistleblower wants to have received information from several government employees that the US President "uses the power of his office" to ensure that another country intervenes in the US election 2020 for its benefit.
At the centre of the accusations is a controversial telephone between Trump and the Ukrainian president Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his fellow officials to investigate that could harm his political rival Joe Biden. It is about earlier operations of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his sprinkler from Ukrainian justice.
The Whistleblower charged the White House with regard to the Ukraine phone also with the disguise: leading government employees would have tried to keep the exact text version of the conversation under the cover. As usual, an electronic text protocol had been made. This had been removed from a database that was usually intended for it and stored in a specially protected system. So far, only a rough discussion protocol has been published.
The identity of the informant is not publicly known. The New York Times reported that it was supposed to be a CIA staff member.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of Tweets on the subject, the President wrote, among other things, that the so-called Whistleblower had disseminated information from second hand that would have proved inappropriate. Therefore, there may be no tips or spies.
As Trump said in New York about those who were supposed to have played information to the Whistleblower, he was upset. The President of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, responded concerned and complained, Trump's statement once again undermined the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives, several investigations against Trump and its environment have been under way in various committees for months. In view of Ukraine's accusations, the Democrats are now proceeding with new vigilance in order to launch a possible procedure of deletion against Trump.
"The Whistleblower gave us a schedule for our investigation," said the Head of the Secret Service Committee at the representative's house, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked ship sharply, threw him a false presentation of things and again called for the resignation of the committee president. Trump swamped ship regularly and had already requested its retreat months ago.
More than 300 former US government officials in the field of security and foreign policy, who were working mostly under democratic but also under Republican presidents, were behind the investigation initiated by the Democrats on Friday for a possible deletion procedure. If the allegations were to be verified, the "scrupulous abuse of power" by Trump would be, it was said, "a scrupulous abuse of power".
There is no precise timetable for the further process. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could strive for a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision to revoke office was made in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects for success of such a procedure are small. So far no US President has been removed by an impeachment procedure.
VW operating rate: jobs are "sleep" decreasing
The VW's plans to further reduce the costs in production could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concerns the car manufacturer's operating council. The brand intends to reduce its annual factory costs by EUR 10 billion by 2023, of which EUR 500 million will be saved this year.
A key to this is the cost of personnel. The "Future Pact" negotiated between companies and the Business Council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14.000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. Basically, a job can only be decreased by the car manufacturer if it is almost proven that the related activities are no longer required.
However, as our newspaper has now learned from business councils, jobs in production, which are not actually at disposal, will be "sleep" over a different way - that is, past the official course. Thus, freely becoming regular jobs would often not be re-employed.
In these cases, the Board of Directors has no opportunity to force the resettlement. In many places, there is no staff increasing the compression of work, the concerns about the gradual bleeding of the vehicle plants would be greater. This also raises the fear that the vehicle production could gradually be deducted from Germany and Europe because it is more favourable in other parts of the world. VW said only: "A change in the employment volume takes place as agreed on socially acceptable along the demographic curve".
The VW brand wants to standardize production worldwide and centralize new projects. It also aims to reduce costs and speed up decisions - the aim is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. The production board Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: "In uncertain times from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the USA and China, we are well advised to make ourselves strong in crisis."
In this way there are already successes: For example, this year, the production costs per vehicle would for the first time decline since 2013 compared to the previous year. Before journalists Tostmann said that the production time for Gulf 8 to be presented on October 24 in Wolfsburg would be shortened by 1.1 hours. Exact figures on production duration do not refer to VW, according to information from our newspaper it is at Golf 7 round
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg plant is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The plants of Braunschweig and Salzgitter manufactured components. For Wolfsburg, the VW-intern is the rule that 800,000 cars must be built annually to ensure that the plant is satisfactoryly profitable. In 2018, however, the use in Wolfsburg was only about 700,000 vehicles - due to the declining diesel demand and the problems of switching to the new WLTP consumption and exhaust gas testing process.
However, as the production board Tostmann announced last year, in Wolfsburg, one million cars are expected to roll out from the band, making it possible to bundle golf production in the main factory - because Zwickau's plant will be converted to the e-auto production site.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of golf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, expectations are now resting on Gulf 8. In spite of all efforts to build e-mobility, the Wolfsburger's bread and butter car should remain.
With Voodoo forced to prostitution: condemned human traffickers
Young women from Nigeria have been sworn, locked into the Ruhr area and forced to prostitution. Six suspected human dealers have to go to jail for this.
Six suspected Nigerian human dealers were sentenced to probation and imprisonment for up to eight years and three months on Friday in Bochum. The accused had dragged young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced prostitution. In order to force their obedience, the Nigerians who wanted to leave had to sworn ritually in front of a voodoo priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought over the Mediterranean by Libyan lockers in tube boats. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. In Germany, they were distributed over various boards to finish the alleged locking costs of an average of 25 000 euros. Therefore, the wage was completely deducted from them.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the introduction and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women on board in the process. "The work made women physically and mentally difficult to create," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann. "Some were rightly responded."
Judgments are based on commercial and bond-based seizures of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, instalment and severe forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIm permanent dispute with the Lufthansa Group has once again threatened Ufo with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union will "inform the labour campaigns in the LH group on October 14th," informed Ufo Office Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and her daughter Eurowings have for months refused to conduct collective negotiations with Ufo, including the question of whether the trade union has legally terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.
On this point Ufo is now being strengthened by a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to see that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examined the appeal. "That a second court sees the matter completely different, I consider it unlikely," said Ufo Board Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also filed an application to the Landesarbeitsgericht Frankfurt for a judicial review of the status of Ufo as a trade union. The company argues that the trade union has not established a representative board for months and is thus unable to fulfil its role as a collective partner.
There was a violent leadership dispute in the Sparten Gewerkschaft, during which numerous members of the Board and the Advisory Council resigned, including the long-standing union leader Nicoley Baublies. The Ufo had suspended an early vote on the strikes of the cabin staff at Eurowings at the end of July, due to doubts about their leadership.
Facilitated entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
So far Saudi Arabia was not exactly known as an international tourist magnet, but it is now intended to change. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visas.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia intends to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, it intends to increase the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission informed.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said Ahmad Al-Chatib, President of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia is hardly accessible to tourists. Visas are usually only for short business trips, religious pilgrimage trips or visitors with residents in the desert state. With the new rules, the ErzkonservativeKönigreich hopes for more revenue from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riad wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in the east of Saudi Arabia: the largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oil field. In the follow-up, the national oil production fell drastically, the oil price shots were high. It is expected to take several weeks until the oil production of the Kingdom reaches its old level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are preparing for the wedding party
Singers Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos in her Instagram stories on Thursday (local time) where she can be seen in the white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others, according to the People magazine, had organized a boy's farewell in Los Angeles.
Justin posted several colorful, including banana printed suits on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me to choose my smoking for the wedding." According to media reports, the celebrity couple wants to marry churchly the next weekend.
The bidders gave themselves the yes word a year ago in a New York station. There was no big party at that time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently explained that after initial problems, they had found a common level: "If you don't want to make compromises, you can't have a relationship."
Two dead in the case of a plane crash in the Czech Republic
Two people died during the crash of a small plane in the West Czech Republic. The wreck was discovered in a forest area near Mecin City, Metchin, on Friday, and the dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
Since Thursday night, the authorities had searched for the machine after the GPS crew had issued an emergency signal. The search was also carried out by a military helicopter. The cause of the accident still needs to be determined. The crash site is about 30 km south of Pilsen (plzen) and 100 km northeast of Regensburg.
Half of the European tree species are threatened by extinction
In addition to pests, disease, alien species, non-sustainable timber and the growth of cities are also causes of the threat, the World Nature Protection Union IUCN reported in Brussels on Friday. It has investigated the stocks of all 454 trees known in Europe. 265 of them do not exist on any other continent. Of these 265, 58 per cent were threatened. 66 were already at the highest level of risk and thus before death.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "risked", "highly endangered", "threatening to die" and "extinct in nature" to "extinct". In total, it lists more than 28,000 species and plants as endangered worldwide.
Eberee and wild horse chestnut threatened
In Germany, Ebereschen (Sorbus) are primarily threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. "Most of them are threatened because the populations are small anyway or due to the transformation or weakening of their habitats".
It also looks bad for the wild common horse chestnuts. They have been regarded as "hazardous" since 2017, level two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat in addition to a mushroom is the Balkan mining moot. Since the 1980s it has spread across the continent and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to be less than 10,000 copies. This assessment does not take into account the trees in cities, parks and alone.
Also in danger of strawberries and mouse
At the same time, IUCN scientists created new European red lists for molluscs, shrubs and mooses. More than a fifth of molluscs and almost half of all strawberries are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly about the destruction of wildlife, the diversified species, agricultural practices and climate change. Molluscs like snakes played a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the soil and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many neglected and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the Office of Europe. "We need to limit the impact of human beings on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority."
Earthquake before Istanbul: 34 injured reported
In the recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people were injured. According to the information, there were no deaths. Dozens of people should have left their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were thus damaged. Since the earthquake on the previous day there have been almost 200 afterbearings. On Thursday, the fortune's 5.8 earthquake had shaken the Marmara region before Istanbul and caused panic in the millions of metropoles.
Now the government intends to use a Commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced. Over the last 20 years Turkey had not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly endangered by earthquakes. Under the marmaramean lies a section of the so-called North Anatolic disorder that marks the border between the eurasian and the anatolic soil plate.
One of the most severe earthquakes was one of the strengths of 7,6 in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time, the epicenter was located in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people died.
Already on Tuesday, an earthquake of strength 4.6 had shaken the region around Istanbul. The authorities called on the inhabitants to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira appear in the mid-term show
The Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will play the mid-term show of the next American football final Super Bowl. This was announced by the singers on Twitter. "No biger will it be," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She is crazy about standing on the Super Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, it will be in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez said that she had dreamed of appearing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - at the time she saw Diana Ross fly to the sky at the mid-term show. "Now it is even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I will perform with another Latina." She could hardly expect "to show what we can do to girls on the world's largest stage."
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she felt honored to stand on one of the largest scenes in the world and represent Latinos and Latinas from the United States and all over the world. "And then on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two "kings" were on a stage together.
Shakira comes from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents come from Puerto Rico.
Combating declining audience numbers
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and mid-term show are among the most viewed TV broadcasts in the United States. Although you have last dropped viewers: this February, the spectacle attracted the least viewers in the United States for more than ten years. Nevertheless, almost hundred million people were still on average.
For the mid-term show of the previous Super Bowl, there was a reluctance: In the fight for dealing with Quarterback Colin Kaepernick, media reports reported that Topstars like Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to appear in February. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the mid-term show - the criticisms were little friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had gone on his knees in the 2016/17 season before NFL games in the national hymn of protest against police violence and racism. With his protest Kaepernick triggered a movement, many players took over the gesture. That made great excitement, US President Donald Trump attacked the most Afro-American football stars sharply. Kaepernick himself has been unbundled since March 2017 and has not fought NFL party anymore. He foresees the clubs not to join him for political reasons.
Cook pipe: Hotels get money from insurance
According to a press report, some banks are expected to be expensive for the travel provider Thomas Cook. It threatens high depreciations of outstanding bonds and loans. This is also the case with Credit Suisse, the "Financial Times" in its Friday issue.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to make total depreciations of up to 1.8 billion UK pounds (around 2 billion euros) on their books, according to the report.
The creditors of bonds would have to buy depreciations from 900 million to 1 billion pounds and the creditors between 550 and 825 million pounds. The actual depreciation amounts are likely to be at the top of the bandwidth, said an expert to the sheet.
How much the losses of creditors will be at the end of the insolvency procedure will prove to be. A person close to this procedure did not have too much hope. For example, the approximately 40 aircraft from Thomas Cook in the UK are "old" and many of the properties are in bad situations. Most money could be picked up with the sale of the airport slots and the brand Thomas Cook, said it.
Rackete reportedly brought suspected murderers to Italy.
Sea-Watch Captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We can't exclude this, but we don't even have secured information about it," said the speaker of the refugee organisation Sea-Watch, Ruben Neubauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants would have recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of rape, torture and killing people in Libya. The suspected perpetrators were arrested in the reception camp in the Italian Messina. New builders stressed that the refugee organizations could not check who they were leaving on their ships. "They come without passports".
Carola Rackete had brought illegal migrants to the port of Lampedusa on 29 June, rafting a ship from the Italian financial police. The same day the three suspects were also expected to have arrived there. Inquiries are under way against the captain for aid to illegal immigration.
USA warn Federal Government of Huawei
The head of the U.S. Internet Authority Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government of trusting the Chinese network provider Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too large," Pai said to the "Handelsblatt" with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" which obliges each company to follow the instructions of the security bodies.
The current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests," the FCC Chief continues. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The federal government has now agreed to demand a "reliance statement" from suppliers.
Berlin wanted first to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt" using its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology is not just hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billion lines of program code that change over time," said Pai.
It is "very difficult to imagine" that a government authority, "wherever, would be able to verify each individual update in real time to detect security risks," the FCC head continues.
The Chinese group Huawei puts close contact with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership relationships are intransparent. The employee company, which allegedly belongs to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai said to the "Handelsblatt".
The United States had evidence that government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently for discussions in Berlin to promote the position of the United States.
Chemistry factory burns in northern France: schools closed
In the night, residents hear explosions. A huge firewall illuminates the sky over a northern French chemical factory. The fire is deleted after hours - the cleaning work could now take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and nurseries in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not open carefully on Friday, the competent prefecture informed. The Ministry of the Interior had asked the citizens to stay in buildings as far as possible and not to be exposed to smoke. There were no injured persons. Farmers and breeders were invited to bring their animals in, protect their feed and stop harvesting first.
The fire could be completely deleted on Thursday evening, as the Prefecture reported. There is still the risk that after the deletion of the smell, the Prefecture on Twitter. According to the Prefecture, 240 firefighters and 90 police officers and Gendarmen were in operation at the fireplace.
A giant black smoke column had risen from the chemical factory before. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of the company Lubrizol, which manufactures additives for oils. The production plant is a few kilometres from the city centre.
According to authorities, the factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous sites, which are particularly monitored. In the Italian Seveso in Milan, a devastating chemical accident had occurred in 1976.
The prefect of the region of Normandy, Pierre-André Durand, said to the broadcaster BFMTV that there was no "high toxicity" in samples at first. However, pollution of the nearby Seine could not be excluded. In the river dams had been built against pollution, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out early in the morning at 02.40 p.m., the authorities reported. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis and lies at the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Minister of Finance: "Germany must invest now"
The French Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to invest more in order to boost economic growth in the euro area.
Germany has to invest now, the sooner the better," said Le Maire on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for next year.
The economy in the euro area is weakening, the Minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens in order to make the necessary decisions."
Action would have to be taken by those countries with budgetary flexibility for more investment, said Le Maire, among other things, with regard to Germany.
France did not have these margins, added the minister, referring to the high government debt of his country, which is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. French government debt must be "stabilized" and "reduced", said Le Maire.
France has in recent years repeatedly called on Germany to make more public investment to revive the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly asked France to cope with its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday provides for tax reliefs of more than nine billion euros for households.
Thus, the French government responds, among other things, to the protests of the yellow-west movement. The re-debt is expected to fall to 2.2 per cent, according to the expected 3.1 per cent this year.
Still trying to trick?: Johnson deviates question about Brexit tactics
The British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticizes the "capitulation law" adopted by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law prescribes to the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos-brexit, but critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. However, the Tory politician insists on this possibility.
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson stands on the question of whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit - despite the last law adopted by Parliament, which is to prevent exactly this.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the date of departure should not have reached an agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capacity law" which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
The former British Prime Minister John Major had stated on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political shakes" in order to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural trick that postpones the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU's departure. Johnson said he was seeking a contract with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement."
Johnson's Chief Adviser Dominic Cummings said that he felt the political disputes about Brexit as a "walking in the park" and proved confident that the desired EU exit would still be achieved: "We enjoy this, we will win, we will not leave the EU," said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph" at a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit Campaign "Vote Leave" during the election campaign before the 2016 EU referendum, is now acting as head of the British government meeting Downing Street. He is supposed to be behind the uncompromising policy that led the Prime Minister into a difficult situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of Linda McCartney's camera, which has become one of the very big rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (Taschen) deep into the whole private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 to Linda's death in 1998, was apparently proud and touched when he presented the picture band "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Among the illustrious guests were Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders-Frontfrau Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event McCartney wrote to Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a fleeing view of the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration of the legacy of LindaMcCartney as a committed artist and the instant magic of the polaroid film."
At Linda McCartney, who studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found her photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids have made it, some of which are now published for the first time in The Polaroid Diaries.
They are portraits, still life, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 1970s until the late 1990s. "She wanted real moments," the art critic Ekow Eshun writes in his preface. And of course again and again is the focus of one: her husband Paul - as one might have never seen him before.
There he dances on his shoulders with his daughter Mary, phones in the bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears unshaped moonboats. Certainly, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but beyond the headlight on her farm in southern England or Scotland also had a very normal life. Thus, according to BBC, Mary McCartney said that she had slept as a baby in a bed that her father had cooked out of old potato boxes. And cleaned it hasn't always been with the McCartneys.
Like hardly another medium, the poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. The recordings of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It's about the decision click: you have to recognize if a great photo happens before you. And then you have to cut it at the exact right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you can cut it two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo." And Linda would have had the gift to catch the exact right moment. "She just knew that she had it," Paul said in the Eshun experiment.
The light, the composition, the image section and the colors are true, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only a entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but also an anecdotic is a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes have always been like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the just newly created Beatles album "Abbey Road", which appeared just 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Turkey wants to continue to import oil and gas from the neighbouring country despite the US sanctions imposed against Iran. In an interview published on Friday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that Turkey could not stop imports of oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," said Erdogan in New York, where he had participated in the UN Assembly.
Erdogan, however, admitted that Turkey had problems with importing Iranian oil, as some companies had "retracted" because of the US threats.
Nevertheless, Turkey will "continue our relations with Iran, particularly in this and many other matters," said the Turkish President, who had repeatedly criticised the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The United States has pursued a policy of "maximum pressure" on the Islamic Republic since its departure from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the United States Iran has secretly pursued a nuclear programme and fails to comply with the agreement.
Its sanctions have led to the collapse of Iran's oil exports and a serious economic crisis in Iran. In recent months the tensions in the Gulf region have increased considerably.
US government wants to restrict the reception of refugees
The U.S. government wants to drastically restrict the reception of refugees. On Thursday, the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the annual ceiling of a resettlement programme should be reduced from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, which is a 40 percent cut.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that although the United States would continue to be committed to supporting refugees, the main task was to protect and serve US citizens.
The U.S. government intends to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted because of their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus endangered, as stated in the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on the other hand, a maximum of 1500 refugees from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
In the 1980 programme, refugees from UN warehouses are selected around the world and resettled in the United States. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the financial year 2020 would be the lowest in the history of the programme. The current ceiling of 30,000 is a low value. When the predecessor of US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number was almost 85,000.
"This is a very sad day for America," said David Miliband, Head of the International Rescue Committee. This would further damage the US's leadership in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the United States, both legal and illegal. The U.S. government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the next financial year, which are separated from the resettlement programme.
Donald Trump - "Come close to a tip"
US President Donald Trump has attacked the informant in the Whistleblower case of spying. Anyone who accuses him of abuse of power had given the appropriate hints, "comes close to a tip," said Trump, according to a record of a private event on Thursday in New York.
So Trump spoke to staff of the United Nations mission. When he was asked about the person who informed the Whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he replied: "This is coming close to a tip." Then Trump added: "Do you know what we did in old times when we were smart? Right. The spies and betrayal, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now."
Observers commented on a possible claim to the death penalty. The Democrats strongly criticized Trump's statements and intimidated him from witnesses. It was also an attempt to impede a congress investigation into a possible deletion procedure against him, wrote the chairmen of the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Secret Service and Supervision in the House of Representatives.
The Whistleblower submits to the President in a now published complaint that he had abused his office in order to ask another country to intervene in the US election 2020. In particular, it is his controversial telephone address with his Ukrainian official colleague Wolodymyr Selenskyj in summer: Trump suggested that he investigates his possible democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump denies any misconduct.
It is still unclear who is both the Whistleblower itself and its informant. However, as the New York Times reports, the Whistleblower is supposed to be an analyst of the CIA's foreign secret service.
Flying boat kentated: Baby and small children drown in Aegean
People are always trying to get through the Egean Sea from Turkey to Greece, often knowing too many small boats. Seven migrants have now died during the downfall of a sleeve, including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants died at the fall of a sleeve. Among the death victims were also a baby and four children, reported the Greek Coast Guard. Four children, three women and five men could therefore be saved from the floods from the occupation of a passing ferry.
Among the victims should also be a locker, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. Migrants had left Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses lies between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
At present, hundreds of migrants from Turkey to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly in too small boats, have been killed on this route last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Assistance Agency (UNHCR), 174 people have been killed.
The Who breaks the concert
A US concert by Rockband The Who has found an end because of the inconvenience of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the appearance in Houston on Wednesday evening (local time) his voice failed. At the eighth song Daltrey said to the audience: "I think I should leave it as long as it still runs".
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend apologised and added that Daltrey could "now really not speak." Townsend promised the audience to come at his expense at a rebate concert. However, a date is not yet fixed.
For Friday in Dallas and Sundays in Denver, The Who resigned. They should be picked up later. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Renting suddenly set: WeWork lets real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork has risen to the largest office owner.
Within a few years, WeWork rises from a small start-up to a driving force to the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in crisis. Renters have to fear billions of revenue.
The crisis of the office owner WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance on the world’s largest real estate markets. The company had a few days ago abandoned Founder Adam Neumann as boss, postponed the planned stock exchange and started selling subsidiaries and values such as the private jet for the executives to gain financial flexibility for the coming weeks and months. In addition, the British "Financial Times", WeWork has stopped the conclusion of new rentals with immediate effect. Thus, among other things, in New York and London, the largest tenant of office space is suddenly out of the market.
WeWork rents large office spaces in the long term and rents them in some small units to members in the short term. This can be individual freelancers, small start-ups or whole divisions of large groups. WeWork has so far burned money with this business at an outstanding speed. Last year, the company has lost $1.6 billion, with a turnover of $1.8 billion. This year alone, the rental costs of new large areas are expected to have risen to an estimated 2.5 billion dollars. In order to limit the loss, the new management will now pull the emergency brakes and have stopped renting new areas with immediate effect.
According to the "Financial Times", WeWork has now signed rental contracts for up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but also for the entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by the economist Dan Alpert from the Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented in Manhatten, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the last 24 months, almost 300,000 square meters of office space. Only WeWorks New contracts made it possible that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the new areas in this time. Without WeWork's expansion, the office space in the US metropolis would have increased in that time, as Alpert wrote in the "Business Insider".
Even in the UK capital, the balance on the real estate market could be felt without further expansion of the aggressive startups. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in a deca purchased by the savings fund provider last year for almost 100 million euros in the centre of the financial metropoles.
Many landlords have restructured their properties for the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If we work to make its business model profitable soon, the landlords would probably have to depreciate part of the expected billions of revenue. Access to WeWork's reserves - at least scarce - do not have them despite long-term rental contracts. Because the rental of the individual locations of WeWork is usually carried out by extra-founded subsidiaries, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only liable within narrow limits.
Russia again identified numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In recent days, 262 more wildernessmen who had fished illegally in the waters had been arrested, according to the Russian domestic intelligence service FSB informed Interfax on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 North Korean fishermen were arrested. Previously, the border guards were shot and three injured. This time there were no injured people. The Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food deficiency.
The North Korean fishermen thus traveled in Russian territorial waters. The Russian Coast Guard is driving patrols for its own information to protect its marine biological resources. The re-checks have discovered 30,000 ink fish. In addition, the data were seized after three fishermen and two motor boats and brought to Nachodka and Posjet at Wladiwostok. According to Ria Nowosti, the Coast Guard in 2018 identified more than 8,000 infringements.
According to the media, thousands of North Korean fishermen have already been arrested there in 2019.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far East region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained about high environmental damage caused by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow synthetic nets banned in Russia. They would also bring small living creatures out of the sea. Furthermore, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea where they needed 200 years to be destroyed. Also the ships themselves do not comply with the hygiene and technical rules.
According to Moscow's reports, three members of the Russian Coast Guard had been injured during the last week's arrests. According to the FSB, a injured North Korean person died later of his injuries. On 17 September, Russian border guards first arrested a North Korean boat and then a second after it had opened the fire.
United States imposes a ban on entry of former President Castro
The United States has imposed bans on the entry of the former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children. The American Ministry of Foreign Affairs founded this in a communication on Thursday with Castro's involvement in "grave human rights violations". As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean, he has a system in which thousands of Cubans would be arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As President of the Armed Forces, the brother of the deceased Revolutionary leader Fidel Castro was also responsible for human rights violations by the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The disrespect of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the lasting crises in Cuba and Venezuela," twittered US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had banned entry among others against members of the Venetian government and the military. In Venezuela, for months, a bitter struggle of power between the government and the opposition has been disturbing. The United States has imposed a whole series of sanctions against Maduro's government to force him into the knees and to help the opposition leader and the self-appointed interim president Juan Guaidó become powerful.
Cuba is considered to be one of the closest allies of Maduros. The Socialist Caribbean Island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of sent doctors. According to the United States and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to assist the government in oppression of government opponents.
New Climate Protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests so far, yet again, thousands of people want to go on the road for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for the Future movement is re-planning actions and demonstrations in dozens of countries around the world. The beginning is likely to be due to the time shift in New Zealand and Australia before protests over Europe to North America. There climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a major exploration in Montreal in Canada. Even before the White House in Washington, demonstrators wanted to meet.
It is relatively unclear how much the world's statement will be this Friday after the record participation of the previous week. Thunberg himself was good. "Last Friday more than four million people have strived for the climate. This Friday we will do it again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far, 6383 actions in 170 countries have been done in the framework of the strike week, she added.
A good third of all world demonstrators - about 1.4 million - had been involved in protests in 575 German cities. This time, according to a listing of the movement, there are talks planned in at least 65 cities. Among them, in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to go on the road for the climate.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had set himself before the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 to call on the politicians of their country to make a stronger effort for climate protection. This led to the Fridays-for-Future movement within a short time. The climate protests mainly involve students and students, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together, they call for more ambition from politics in the fight against global warming and the threatening climate disaster. In particular, according to the Paris Climate Agreement, global warming must be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg had arrived in New York just a month ago after a two-week transatlantic tower with a high-sea race hunt. The last time she had participated in climate protests and United Nations summits, she held an emotional speech at the United Nations on Monday, in which she strongly spoke to the Heads of State and Government of the Earth. In her homeland, Stockholm, she had been agreed to use the alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation for climate protection on Wednesday.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
In the future, people in Russia must no longer smoke on the balcony. This provides for a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," said a speaker from the Ministry of Emergency Affairs on Thursday in Moscow, according to the Tass Agency. The ban should enter into force on 1 October.
Anyone who smokes, therefore, has to expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (€42.46). If the cigarette should set a fire, then the penalty will be higher. According to the Ministry, the ban also includes burning candles. Also grilling meat sprinkles on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Clash against cyber criminals - Investigators lift servers
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time elevated a large server provider for illegal transactions in Darknet.
A total of 13 offenders are suspected of having hosted numerous websites on the Mosel as an operator of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach, via the international criminals.
This was announced by the Attorney General in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested in a major action on Thursday night. Darknet is a protected part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects are supposed to have been the operators of the world's second largest Darknet drug marketplace, "Wall Street Market", which had broken in the spring. The attack on 1,25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was also controlled by a server in the cyberbunker, according to the Public Prosecutor.
It was said that such a host was first raised in Germany. A web host provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
During the access operation, with the support of specialised units such as the GSG9, searches were carried out in Germany and neighbouring abroad. It was the result of nearly five years of investigations. In the afternoon, the investigators wished to provide further details.
New global climate protests by Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests so far, yet again, thousands of people want to go on the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement again planned actions and events in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including Metropoles such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a major exploration in Canada's Montreal.
Climate Protests Ελλάδα Who are Thunberg's backmen?
Righteousness and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoking plants that warm up the climate. The more amazing is that a 16-year-old girl holds the people of power before the nose of this time. But what's behind it? Is it help or smart marketing of a climate activist? Historical masterpiece or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg moves the masses and brings young people to rise for a better climate-friendly world. Historically it is not the first time in Europe that a young person creates a collection of children and young people to win for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt exquisite to work for a more equitable world. At that time, he also won a bunch of young people and persuaded them to cross the sea to enter the promised country, just as Greta Thunberg recently made his trip to America with a sailboat.
But there is a shadow side in this respect? Why do we need an action called "We don't have time" to save the world? Moreover, Greta Thunberg has been rich PR manager on its side. Besides, her mother has published a book that has sold itself extensively, thanks to the daughter standing in the light of the ramp. Also old followers of Greta Thunberg were a little disappointed about the last PR show, or the trip with the boat was probably too big. This is also not unfounded, because the action came very well into the world in the media and it flows a lot of money thanks to the imposing action.
The spirits now differ: Is it morally right to enrich themselves financially when saving the world? Is it still authentic when certain circles work together with stock exchange brokers during the world rescue action? No matter what position is ultimately given, a critical and reflective viewpoint is increasingly important in a democratic society, because democracy lives with different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense to question critically what certain trends make.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A strange comet is crossing our solar system right now.
The assumptions of the astronomers have confirmed themselves: a strange comet is crossing our solar system at the moment - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet from another star crosses our solar system at the moment. He was baptized after his discoverer 2I/Borisov and currently employs astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissow in Crimea. He looked with a self-built telescope to the sky and further follow-ups confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that is not from our solar system. He is only the second of his kind, which was seen during the transit.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to get out of the vicinity insights into a foreign solar system. Apparently, the comet resembles our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canaries. The comet is clearly interstellar from the International astronomical Union (IAC) and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbel track that leads it out of our system.
Comet has been seen before arrival - and can be observed for several months
But before it is so far, astronomers can closely observe him. Unlike his predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in his approach, which means that he can be investigated from the Earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen by medium-sized telescopes by April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia by the US Space Authority Nasa. "Then it will only be observed by October 2020 with larger, professional telescopes."
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings about Komet 2I/Borisov awaken hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometers of diameter. At the same time the heavenly body seems to be similar to our comets - for as IAC researcher Julia de León expresses it, the spectrum of the swivel star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form themselves through similar processes as in our, added de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond individual knowledge. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within only two years may allow a new way of exploring certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids constantly employ the researchers. Only recently a giant asteroid passed by the earth and came dangerously close to her.
"Absolutely disgusting": Rachel Johnson is shocked by brother
To Boris Johnson it becomes lonely. First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister has clearly cast the war language of the Prime Minister as "smakless". It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "Betrayal", contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is always equipping - at least verbal. During the question hour at the bottom of the house this Wednesday it was a massive upset of the opposition, and in the meantime, more critics have spoken: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author said to the broadcaster Sky News, her brother uses words like surrender, as if the opponents of an EU exit should be "hung, long-distanced, quarreled, bittered and feathered". She considers this to be extremely disgusting. She does not recognize the version of her brother," said Rachel Johnson, who had joined the anti-Brexit party "Change UK" in the elections to the EU Parliament.
She was particularly opposed to the fact that her brother Jo Cox mentioned, an EU-friendly under-house member who had been murdered by a neonazi a few days before the 2016 resignation. It was best to honor their memory by passing through the Brexit, Boris Johnson said in the under-house. "It is very tasteless to refer to a member who was murdered by someone who called 'Britain first'," now criticized Johnson's sister. The offender had obviously come out of the right-wing camp, which feels "hardened by this kind of language". For all those who mourned for them, it would be very tasteless.
The widow of Cox also criticized the Prime Minister sharply. "It makes me sick when Jos's name is used like this," he tweeted. The best way to honor them is by being passionate and determined for what one believes in - no matter what one thinks of it. But never should "demonize the other side" he also complained that an atmosphere had emerged, in which attacks had become more likely.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson, younger brother Jo, had set up his office as State Secretary and his mandate as Tory MP. "I had broken between loyalty to the family and national interest in recent months - it is an indissoluble tension," Jo Johnson founded the step.
Johnson's language was also severely criticised in the church. As the "Times" reported, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language "not worthy of this country". In a joint statement they stated: "In recent days, the language, both in debates and outside Parliament, has been unacceptable. We should speak with respect."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez appear at the Super Bowl
The NFL is a strong sign in the year of its 100-year-old existence: In the mid-term show of the next Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots appear. They promise "a explosion of fun and energy".
Latina-Power at Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the mid-term show at the next final of the US Football League NFL. This was announced by the organizers on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community next to JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the United States," Shakira reported in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, will take place in Miami on February 2nd. Many people live with Latin American roots in the metropolis of Florida. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is a puerto-rican origin.
"I love it that the Super Bowl puts two women on stage this time - and two Latinas," Lopez said. This sent an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents had emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and will be seen in the drama "Hostlers" in German cinemas from November.
Shakira was known as a star of a telenovela and singer in Colombia. She created her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Whereever".
The announcement of the mid-term guests is expected in the US every time with excitement. This year, many of them also become a political gesture. Finally, the country is deeply divided, not least through the immigration policy of President Donald Trump.
The Super Bowl is the largest US sports event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacular. Musicians like Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones have provided furors there. Usually, at the NFL final watch over 100 million TV viewers, it is also very popular in Germany.
Last year, there were political controversies. The reason for the conflict about the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to stand up in protest against police violence against blacks in the play of the national hymn and had been tackled hard by US President Donald Trump, among others. In solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had rejected a Super Bowl appearance - including Rihanna and Pink. The fact that the Maroon 5 rock group appeared was ultimately criticised by many.
An actor and Youtuber adds Egypt's ruler: first Mohamed Ali remains abroad.
The two men who influenced whether there was blood flowing again on the streets of Egypt have both spent the last week abroad. One of them was floating again at Cairo Airport on Friday. President of State Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The former General, who in 2013 left the Muslim brother Mohammed Mursi, the first freely elected Head of State of the country, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisi's action against political Islam and lost no shield about human rights violations on the Nile - in a week when Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people because they had been dare to protest against the President. He had "no reason to worry," said Sisi at the airport in the microphones of the state television. "The Egyptians are not allowed to go wrong."
In the opinion of the president of the other man who currently decides what is going on on on the streets. Mohamed Ali, of course, stayed abroad, where he escaped the access of the security forces who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter the Egyptian soil. weeks ago, the 45-year-old as an actor was only known as a minority of Egyptians. Today he is the voice that dominates the political discourse in the cafes, living rooms and teashrubs of the country: With his Youtube channel "Mohamed's secrets" Ali appeals his countrymen to rise against Sisi.
He goes to the head of state directly and in a completely rustic language. While the people are hungry, the President swells in luxury and let himself build great new palaces, it says. The army leadership, on which Sisi relies its rule, throws Ali out corruption and enrichment. Because he in his second job as a builder for 15 years with exactly these men's business, he seems to know exactly what he's talking about - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as the exact exploding click numbers show.
After the first demonstration of thousands of people against his rule since Sisi's grip after power last week and having been arrested, almost 2000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, for this Friday, Ali called for a "Million march". It was unlikely that so many people would be involved in the streets. But there were single smaller protests, for example in Giseh, Cairo, and in China, at Luxor. Videos in social media showed protests, whose participants Al-Sisi claimed corruption and their departure. In these protests, the police also set up tear gas and rubber floors. These videos were not to be verified independently.
From the city of Mansura in the Nildelta, where demonstrators broke banners with the President's portrait in pieces last week, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces built checkpoints in the city and at the crash roads. In Cairo several metro stations in the city centre were closed for "maintenance work", most of the streets around the Tahrir Square, the heart of the revolution of 2011, blocked. And at the Rabaa place, on which in 2013 the followers of the crashed Muslim brother Mursi were snatched, until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure should prevent discontented people from gathering: Sisi's future party wanted to hold a grand declaration for the President here.
Mohamed Ali caused these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal must not be the Tahrirplatz", said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. "Let's not meet with police officers." But as a retreater, that is not to be understood: "Gang Egypt is the Tahrirplatz".
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems much slower than requested by the provider, there are different testing options.
Anyone who concludes an Internet contract does not need to blindly trust the provider's speed data. Customers can check in case of notices themselves how much of it is actually achieved.
Finally, the previously promised transfer rates are a component of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains Bayern’s Consumer Centre.
If the connection always seems much slower than requested by the provider, there are various testing options. For example, the measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"Tests by suppliers are, however, carried out according to supplier-specific requirements and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively," the Consumer Centre Bayern says on its side.
If the connection is significantly slower than announced, customers can set a reasonable period of 14 days to the provider to produce the promised performance. This is the best way for interested parties to do by lettering a petition.
If this does not work even after multiple calls, customers can terminate and may also claim damages. However, if there is no success, only the way of appeal will help.
First high-ranking Republican for investigation
As the first high-ranking Republican, the governor of Vermont has voted for an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where it comes from, is determined by the facts that are detected," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wanted to know more about the Whistleblower affairs before action - an impeachment procedure can lead to the termination of the President - is taken.
Scott said that he was not surprised by revelations that Trump repeatedly asked the Ukrainian president Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate interventions by the democratic candidate and former vice-president Joe Biden in Ukraine. For Trump observed Biden "since years".
The Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump for the Whistleblower case; few have shown discomfort for that. Scott’s statements are a first sign of this in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already turned several times against Trump’s policy, such as the relief of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration rules.
Spider-Man stays in the MCU: Further Marvel film planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August it became known that Sony and Marvel will go separate paths in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was completely unclear how the films around Tom Holland should go on.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home". This is a consistent report from several US media. Therefore, the film start should be recorded: in the United States the film will start from July 16, 2021.
In the magazine "Screenrant" Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige is quoted: "I am pleased that Spidey's path will continue in the MCU. I and all of them at the Marvel studies are very pleased that we can continue to work on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes, since Sony continues to work on his Spidey version. You never know what will bring the future."
But what about the sudden good news? Sony Marvel is supposed to have submitted an offer. According to industry magazines, the Disney Group, which also belongs to Marvel, would participate with 30 percent in the coming Spider-Man movies. However, the message is not confirmed.
So Duke Meghan and Prince Harry show up in the "Suits" final
After nine seasons, the "Suits" series in the USA has now arrived at the big final. In the last episode there were many Happy Ends and as many Cameo performances. And also the Royal Couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who participated in the series for many years, was given a charming tribute. Attention, the following sections include Spoiler for the series final.
One precedent: Duchess Meghan did not return in the final for a last goodbye as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some re-views showed the most memorable scenes with the duchess of today. For example, the moments of the failed and successful wedding with Mike or how she welcomed him after his imprisonment.
But also her true husband, Prince Harry, was occasionally mentioned in the "Suits" final, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) screams straight towards the altar to marry his fiancé Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a significant remark about his suit. If he had actually overwhelmed a hobby, the dull Harvey from the bride wants to know only to make a nice remark: "Louis, you are not the Prince of England".
Aegean: Baby and four more children drown in the event of boat accident
A baby and four other children were drowned when a refugee boat was sent to the Aegean Sea. A total of seven people died in the disaster, as the Greek Coast Guard announced on Friday. The nationalities were still unclear.
The boat fell near the Greek island of Inousses, located between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
At present, hundreds of migrants from Turkey move to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Assistance Agency (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route. Federal Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced to want to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the Commissioner responsible for the EU, he wanted to "inform Turkey about how the refugee situation stands," said Seehofer on Friday. He wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to be able to deal with them.
On Friday, a spokesperson from the European Commission confirmed the planned trip of the Seehofers with EU Internal Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and French Minister for the Interior, Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, there are still unusually many migrants from Turkey. On Tuesday alone, 654 people moved to the Greek islands, said the Greek Ministry of Citizens' Protection on Wednesday.
Does the Turkey deal still work?
The increase in figures last led to doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey Agreement concluded in 2016, which provides that the EU will be able to send all refugees and migrants who are illegally coming through Turkey to the Greek islands. In return, the EU wanted to take up a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every deported Syrian.
However, on the Greek side, the processing of asylum applications is only difficult due to the lack of personnel. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos have nearly 29 400 people. The worst is the situation in Lesbos: in a camp with capacity for 650 people, there are currently 5200 migrants.
Never since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016 had it been so many, the state radio reported.
Climate change: Heat leads to more heart attack

Especially the cardiovascular system made high temperatures and high temperature jumps within a short time and led to more heart attacks. Especially people with cardiovascular diseases, elderly people and diabetics are affected.
Green politician has to be responsible for embarrassing photo panes
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was manipulated for this reason of the cups?
The Canadian Green Shepherd holds a multiway cup in his hand on a photo. But now came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has remained unnoticed for quite a long time - and finally noticed. The reusable coffee cup with metal straw has never been held in hand by Elizabeth May, the chief of the Canadian Greens. On the party’s website she was on a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published and also distributed to the media - and there was still a sneaky (pap) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green Shepherd has to be responsible for photo pans
The National Post then launched manipulation and that the party produces fake news to appear more credible in the topic of "environmental protection", and that in the middle of a election campaign for the underhouse election, in which Trudeau is also becoming increasingly difficult due to a bribery scandal.
The photo went virally into social media and talked about Fake News. A user shares a comparison of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their presidents to conceal their single cups."
May was shocked and costly on her blog that she didn't know anything about this action. To emphasize that, she immediately posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, a cup in hand. However, she put it right, is from Bamboo. She always had it. A party spokesman said it was just about placing the party logo in the picture, and not to hide something. From the photo there is only one cut to see on the website.
May writes, it hurts the employee who did this. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she said to the Guardian, and at the same time asked her team: "If they want to edit a picture again, they wouldn't be able to do something with my face, so I look younger?"
The German Greens were also found because of their use of single-purpose plastics or flights to Shitstorms - but their pictures were not photoshopped. Thus, the chef of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice cream on holiday with plastic lobsters, as merkur.de* reported.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: Lifelong flight ban at Cathay
It was alleged that Jaqueline Ng had been upgraded by Cathay Pacific by email. But when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed to board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontan get a upgrade for the Business Class - of which many are dreaming passengers. Sometimes they have luck, and employees at the check-in offer a free change from the Economy Class.
However, this case shows how not to do it: A self-explained influencer has actively asked the Airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram Jaqueline Ng follow over 65,000 users. On May 30, she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7th.
On the flight, the employees refused to upgrade Jaqueline, although they had shown an e-mail in which Cathay Pacific allegedly expected to upgrade. The letter wants to have received the influencer from an airline marketing employee. On the other hand, the airline accuses Jaqueline of fake the e-mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get a upgrade for the long-range flight. This time the woman would have shown the same mail, but with another reference number. The JFK airport staff were skeptical: they hacked up at the center. And in fact, the employee from whom the mail is supposed to have rejected the email contact with Jaqueline. That also confirmed the email system in which the messages did not appear.
The airline employees at the airport canceled Jaquelines' ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For $1,400 (around $1,280), they had to buy a new ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company representing consumer interests. Although Cathay had reimbursed her the price of her original ticket, Jaqueline also recovered the costs of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: Cathay has committed fraud, it remains blocked for future flights. The airline's terms and conditions also state that it does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with it - and now turns on a lawyer.
Oil prices according to report on ceasefire in Yemen
Oil prices fell by more than one dollar in the shortest time on Friday afternoon. Lastly, a barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea resort Brent cost $61.83 - approximately 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price for a barrel of the American West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to $55.77.
The trigger for the course was a report from the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is supposed to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
In mid-September, a drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had brought about five percent of the world's oil production. The Huthi rebels allies with Iran in the civil war country of Yemen had declared the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the U.S. government, is responsible for Iran. A ceasefire would remove the political tension in the region.
If an agreement is actually reached, we could focus on growth and demand concerns," said Ole Hansen, Head of the Rohstoffstrategie department at the Saxo Bank of Bloomberg News Agency.
The oil prices thus continue its downward movement of the past days. One week ago a barrel of WTI oil had cost up to almost $59, Brent almost $65.
Lastly, Bloomberg, appealing to insiders, reported that after the attack in mid-September, the repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia would progress faster than expected. Therefore, the volume of production had again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and moved back towards the original quantity.
Lastly, there were several press releases calling for insiders, reporting on rapid progress by the State Oil Group Saudi Aramco in the repair work. However, raw materials experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently trying to avoid a plane and negative headlines.
At the same time, some relaxation occurred in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after Iran's arrest and the recent release on the way to leave the port. The crew now prepares the departure while the ship is still ahead of anchor, shipowner Erik Hånell informed the Swedish radio in a SMS on Friday morning.
However, the U.S. announced to move missiles and soldiers to the Iranian enemy to Saudi Arabia. Fear of escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom had stimulated oil prices significantly over the past few weeks.
Prosecutions against Trump Enhanced
In the affair of possible power abuse by US President Donald Trump, disguise charges against the White House have become loud. Several leading government employees would have strived intensively to prevent access to the text version of the conversation after a disputed telephone between Trump and the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July. This explained an anonymous pointer. The speaker of the House of Representatives, the Democrat Nancy Pelosi, explicitly cast "disguise" to the White House. Trump spoke of a "hexenjagd".
North Korea considers the third summit of Trump and Kim to be questionable
North Korea has expressed doubts that in the nuclear dispute there will soon be a third summit of powerors Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The sense and prospects of such a meeting are questionable due to the lack of progress in the implementation of agreements of the first summit in Singapore, said Kim Kye-gwan on Friday, according to the KCNA agency.
The United States would not have done anything to implement the decisions of the summit in the previous year, said the consultant of the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He also criticized the US sanctions and the common military manoeuvres of the United States and South Korea. But he hoped for a "wise" and "moderne" decision of Trump to bring about a new approach.
On Monday, Trump had said that he wanted to know what to bring a third summit with Kim before he declared ready to do so. Negotiations on disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile programme have come to the top since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in February in Hanoi. In June, both of them met in the demilitarised zone between the two Korean States, and they agreed to revive the discussions, but so far without great success.
Prince Harry: Arms manufacturers should help mine clearance
The British Prince Harry, in Angola, symbolically burned and destroyed an explosive mine with a blue fragment protection vest. Close to a camp of the British Halo Trust at the place of Dirico, he made the ignition circle. In a safe distance, the explosive exploded. In view of the goal of getting Angola mined free by 2025, he later called on the current TV cameras: "I call on all the countries whose names stand on these weapons, but have not helped to clear the roads to commit themselves to help."
Pfund under pressure - expected interest reduction
British Pound under pressure
In view of a short-term interest rate reduction, the pound loses value over the euro.
Frankfurt speculations for a short-term interest rate reduction by the Bank of England (BoE) add to the Pound of Sterling. The British currency declined by up to 0.4 percent on Friday to $1.2269.
The starters of the sales were the statements of the banknote banker Michael Saunders. This one brought down interest rates, even if a chaotic Brexit could be turned off, since the uncertainty will affect the British economy for a predictable time. This statement is surprising as Saunders applied as a defender of a restrictive monetary policy, said Analyst Ricardo Evangelista from the brokerhouse ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burden of the Brexit Hickhack on the economy without signaling a direct interest reduction. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country out of the EU without a divorce agreement on 31 October.
More: With his provocations the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk. But it could pay for him, says Handelsblatt-Redaktur Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Other Russian manipulations have been demonstrated
Material from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory is being manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, former Director of the World Antitidoping Agency (Wada) and today's Head of Integrity of the Leichtathletik-Weltverband.
New details on the doping scandal in Russia will appear at the start of the light athletic World Cup, and they will destroy the little credibility that Russian sport had gained back at the beginning of the year, and that it was only a step back. In January 2019, the Moscow doping lab finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Antitidoping Agency (Wada).
In December 2014, systematic fraud had been revealed in Russian sports. The Wada had blocked the Russian Antidoping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. After individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games, the International Olympic Committee had attended around 270 athletes of the country under neutral flag in Rio, and 168 Russian athletes were at the start of the winter games in February 2018. Also at the World Cups in the various sports, they were forced to attend the football World Cup with the host in Russia in summer.
Missing positive findings
In the following September, Wada revoked the Rusada banner, but requested access to the laboratory and the samples mentioned. The data should provide information on the extent of the destruction of doping cases during state doping. They should help to punish athletes later. Three months later they were finally delivered.
However, the Chair of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the Leichtathletik-Weltverband (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analysis laboratory were manipulated. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the Task Force received the correct data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" on Friday. "We found numerous discrepancies between the data that the Wada received from a whistleblower, and those that it received from the Russians in January".
The World Cup is not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Leichtathletik Association is the only organization that holds the ban on Russia. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes under a neutral flag started. They had to prove that they were training outside the Russian system and subjected to tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada manipulations had already been put in the room and urged Russia to respond to the accusations within three weeks. Russia now threatens the new blockade of the Rusada and, in the worst case, the exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
