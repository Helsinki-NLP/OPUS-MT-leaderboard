Members of the Wales National Assembly concerned that they will be “compared to Muppets”
The members of the Wales National Assembly are disappointed by a proposal that their title would be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a result of the plans to change the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ to ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name is ridiculous.
A member of the Wales National Assembly of the Labour Party said that MWP ‘mitting on Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for crazy and pwp is Welsh for pussy.
A member of the Wales National Assembly of the Plaid Party said that the group as a whole was “discontented” and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his party was ‘open’ for the name change, but noted that the words MWP and Muppet were very similar.
In this context, the Welshe letter W is pronounced as a short you.
The Commission of the Wales National Assembly, which is currently preparing legislation to implement the change of name, said: ‘It is of course the members of the Wales National Assembly themselves who take the final decision on their new title.’
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave members of the Wales National Assembly the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be renamed to Parliament.
With regard to the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or WMPs, but MWP option was most supported in the public consultation.
At present, the members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will be difficult to reach a consensus, and she will have to present a bill on changes in a few weeks.
The reform legislation also includes other changes to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the system of committees.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote definitively on their new title when they debate legislation.
Macedonian residents vote in a referendum on the change of the name of their country
On Sunday, voters will vote whether they want to change the name of their country into the ‘Republic of Northern Macedonia’.
The popular referendum was organised in an attempt to resolve an instigated dispute with neighbouring Greece, which owns a province named Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country would claim to its territory and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia's applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is against the referendum on the change of name, said that he would not take into account the outcome of the referendum.
However, people in favour of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The watches of Saint Martin's silence, the watches of Harlem have difficulty
‘The older people with whom I spoke said that earlier there was a café and a church in every corner,’ said Mr. Adams.
Today there is neither a café nor a church to see."
He said it's understandable that cafés have disappeared.
"Men now have a different way of social contact," he said.
‘Cafés are no longer the living room of the neighborhood, where people regularly visit.’
However, he is concerned that the revenue from the sale of the assets of the churches will be less long if the leaders expect, ‘and sooner or later they will be back at the beginning’.
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments where the kind of people would live that will not help in the remaining shelters of the neighborhood.
‘The vast majority of people who will buy apartments in such buildings will be white,’ he says, ‘which will lead to the closure of these churches even faster, because it is unlikely that the people who move to these apartments will become members of the church community.’
Both churches were once built by a white church, before Harlem became a black metropole: the metropole community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church of white methodists left in the 1930s.
A black church community from the neighborhood took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church under the direction of Father John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott from the shoppers in 125th Street, an important shopping street in Harlem, where blacks could rarely get a job or be promoted.
In 1939 the building was severely damaged by fire, but when the parishmen of Father Johnson planned to rebuild the church, they also bought a beard.
Father David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, proudly called the beard 'the watches of the poor'.
The expert who played the beard in July referred in another way to the instrument: ‘a cultural treasure’ and ‘an irreplaceable historical instrument’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first brigade in the world ever played by a black musician, namely Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the larger brigade of the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's hadn't replaced him.
The events of the past months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some hired by the church's leak leaders, others by the bishop.
The consistorium (the governing body of the parish, consisting of leak leaders) wrote the bishop in July to express its concern that the bishop would want to transfer the costs to the consistor, although the consistor had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors who had sent the bishop.
Some parishes complained about the lack of transparency of the bishop.
Shark wounds 13-year-old who drove to shrubs in California
Saturday, on the first day of the screaming season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who was drowning for screams in California.
The attack took place just before 7:00 in the morning near Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help. Together with some others, he pedaled to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that he first thought the boy shouted because he had caught a scum, but then he realized “that the boy shouted: “I was bite!
I'm bite!'
His key leg was completely open," Hammel saw when he approached the boy.
‘I shouted that everyone should go out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’.
The boy was taken with a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is alleged to be in danger of life.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
At a press conference, the beach guard captain Larry Giles told me that a shark had been spun in the area a few weeks before, but that it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured at the upper body.
The authorities closed access to the beach of Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and safety purposes.
Giles noted that more than 135 shark species live in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's wish to break through the British beauty market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and directs beauty departments where specialized assistants work, such as in wholesale stores.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the British beauty market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while the sale of fashion and household articles continues to fall. The larger beauty departments are tested in 11 shops throughout the country. If they prove to be a success, they will be introduced in more shops next year.
The investment in the beauty market is also the result of the fact that supermarkets want to fill up with other products the strips where TVs, microwaves and interior items were ever held.
Sainsbury's wants to double its beauty offering and offer 3,000 products, including for the first time branding such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also the existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees gets more place, with space per brand, such as in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also brings its Boutique make-up back to the market, as most products are suitable for vegans, something younger and more demanding shoppers.
In addition, the parfumerie the Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two shops of Sainsbury. The first was previously opened in Croydon, south of London, the second is later opened in Selly Oak, in Birmingham.
Since more and more people shop online and more and more on a daily basis buy small amounts of food in local supermarkets, supermarkets need to make more effort to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, says that the shops will look more and more like wholesale homes, now that the supermarket chain takes it against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos sales points into hundreds of shops and has also opened a number of Habitats since the two chains were taken over two years ago. According to the company, the sales of food have increased and the acquisitions have increased profitability.
The last time the supermarket tried to give its departments Beauty and Pharmaceuticals a make-over, that became a flop.
Sainsbury's experimented with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but the cooperation was terminated when there was a conflict about the distribution of revenue from the pharmacy department in the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's 281 pharmacy departments in the shops three years ago for a sum of 125 million UK pounds sold to Celesio, owner of the chain Lloyds Pharmacy.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, by adding a wide range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury, said: “We have completely changed the design of our beauty department so that it is more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our offer of brands we offer for everyone what we want, and thanks to the attractive surroundings and convenient locations we make sure that our customers like to buy their beauty products from us, and no longer shop in the old way."
Peter Jones 'raged' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the deal of 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is 'rageous' because television presenter Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a deal of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle company. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
Jones's and Willoughby's company is compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced on Instagram that she would leave.
Peter Jones van Dragons Den is upset with Holly Willoughby, because she has withdrawn from their profitable lifestyle company at the last moment to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was ‘raged’ when Willoughby did not hold enough time for Truly, her brand for homewear and accessories, during a difficult meeting in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday.
The company is compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune from an estimated GBP 11 million.
When the 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she would leave Truly, Jones went to one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said, ‘Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It would ensure her long-term future and deliver enough for the next decades.
Everyone was surprised when she decided to withdraw.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was scheduled for soon.
The warehouse of the main location in Marlow is full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter, one of the most profitable stars of Britain, could cost the company millions, due to the large investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launch could now be further delayed.
And that could mean the end of years of friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been friends for ten years with Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 together with Capp, and Jones, 52, became president of the company in March.
The two pairs often go together on holidays and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will soon become brand ambassador of M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of the program I'm A Celebrity on the British ITV station.
A source from Jones' entourage said last night: ‘We have no comment on his business affairs.’
Hard language ‘and then it was love between us’
He laughed at the criticism he would receive in the media for a comment he made that some people would find ‘inappropriate for a president’, and for his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a newsanker when he said:
"I didn't give up anything."
He added that Kim was interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards the dismantling of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons have been closed.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June, the North Korean top diploma Ri Yong Ho told the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea did not see a ‘according’ reaction by the United States after the first North Korean disarmament initiatives.
In the meantime, the United States continues with its sanctions to keep the pressure on the boiler, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
“We do very well in North Korea,” he said.
“We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim have led to positive results. The missile tests have been completed, hostages have been released and the material surpluses of American soldiers have returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave as a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get access to this busy arena, there would be about 200 people here,” Trump said, while he was in front of the audience.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island, with hundreds of deaths
In the aftermath of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs heard that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had no home, no national disaster was announced, which is a requirement for international assistance.
‘In many cases, it is unfortunately clear that they do not apply for international aid, which is difficult for us,’ said Mrs Sumbung.
Save the Children is making up a team to travel to Palu, but it is not sure whether the helpers from abroad can work on the spot.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman of the National Disaster Assistance Agency, said that Indonesian officials were still in the process of assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations were to be allowed to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still particularly badly prepared for the anger of nature.
In Aceh, hiding places were built to scroll at tsunamis, but on other coasts you rarely see them.
The fact that there was no warning siren for tsunamis in Palu, even if there was a strong warning, was likely to contribute to the number of deaths.
Even under ideal conditions it may be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship in Lombok to treat victims of earthquakes is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before the ship reaches the site of the disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia's hailless infrastructure was one of the key points of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and he has already spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But President Joko's government has a lack of funding, while he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from ongoing sectary tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority today follow a rather conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their home because Christian and Islamic gangs fought on the streets, with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool provides impressive equalmaker against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge guarded Liverpool last Saturday for loss against Chelsea in the Premier League, with a target in the 89th minute, during a race in Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he stood at a distance of about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, at the time his team was behind with 1-0.
He ticked left against the ball and then kicked in the direction of the ultimate stake.
The ball flew high above the shovel area, in the direction of the right top corner of the net.
He escaped the jump of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible,” said Sturridge against LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching and dare to try. I didn’t really think about it, I just kicked on the ball.”
Chelsea stood at the rest with 1-0, after a target of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The peak of The Blues threw the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovacic, and then he hurried through the center to Liverpool's play hill.
Kovacic did a quick one-two in the middle.
Afterwards he gave a nice stack, which allowed Hazard to reach the criminalization area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Alisson Becker of Liverpool in the net, next to the rear stake.
Liverpool plays on Wednesday at 3 p.m. in the group phase of the Champions League against Napoli, in the Stadium of San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will take on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League.
Deaths of tsunami in Indonesia up to 832
The deaths of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, said the Agency for National Disaster Assistance Sunday morning.
Many people were stuck in the ruins of buildings that had collapsed as a result of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 last Friday, with waves of 6 m high, said spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is full of ruins of broken buildings.
Police arrests 32-year-old man for suspicion of murder after a woman has been shot dead
This morning, a woman's body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside, after which a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 in Grayson Mews, John Street, and the body had stab wounds, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder suspected.
The police ask local residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Police Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: ‘The investigation has just begun, but I want everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard something suspicious request to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, in particular taxi drivers, to contact us if they have possibly filmed something through a dashcam, because they can have information that is essential for our research."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon came friends who think they know the woman on the spot to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is under way and the police have confirmed that they are currently informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his apartment, but the police have been told that no one is allowed to enter or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what happened.
The inhabitants are now told that it will take hours to return home.
A policeman would have told someone that the area is treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared crying on the spot.
She just keeps repeating: ‘What bad!’.
At 2 p.m., two police cars were inside the settlement, and one third was just outside.
Within the deposit, a number of agents were monitoring the apartment building.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crime Stoppers at 0800 555 111, with log 247 dated 30 September.
Statue of Cromwell to the UK Parliament is the latest victim of the 'return history'-rel
The banishment of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of the many cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatic puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as ‘dwaze’ and ‘an attempt to rewrite history’.
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: ‘It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of statues would lead to the fiction of the figure of Oliver Cromwell just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The beautiful image of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, bears witness to the opinion prevailing in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure that, according to many, still needs to be recognised.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: ‘Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether that is a perfectly correct presentation, there is still a debate on it.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has formed the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure that represents one side of that gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognized and remembered."
Killing pig doesn't kill Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to reports in the local media.
The man, of whom only the surname ‘Yuan’ is known, was found dead at a stalk on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou. His artery was bowed through and he sat under the blood, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, a pig farmer prepares for pig rinsing in a pig strain in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He would have traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market on Wednesday.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and turned out to be open to a neighboring pig stalk.
According to the cousin, a large male pig with blood was found on his mouth in the pig hok.
A forensic investigation showed that the 250 kg swine had killed the farmer, according to the report.
‘My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated,’ said the cousin named ‘Wu’, according to the Guiyang Evening News newspaper.
Images of surveillance cameras show that Yuan arrived on the market Thursday at 4.40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that the man killed was not from Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked in order to prevent others from attacking, while the police collected evidence on the spot.
The Yuan family and market authorities are currently negotiating compensation for his death.
It happens rarely, but there have been cases of pigs attacking people before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man to be seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 300 kg pushed a farmer from Wales against his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba witnessed at CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood aggression can trigger.
‘They're just plays.
They're like kids, they're very curious, they don't want to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
The tail of the hurricane Rosa brings heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, the hurricane Rosa is weakening as it reaches the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring heavy rain to the north of Mexico and the southwest.
With a wind speed of 135 km per hour, Rosa was a category 1 hurricane on Sunday morning at 5 p.m. and was 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move to the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough over the Pacific, moving eastward to the west coast of the United States, begins to form. When Rosa approaches the Peninsula of Baja California on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical humidity is pushed northward, southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring 10 centimeters of rain on Monday to parts of Mexico.
Then tropical moisture that reacts with the approaching trog will cause widespread rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous floods, waste streams and possibly landslides in the desert.
Tropical moisture will cause precipitation of 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
The rain is expected to be between 5 and 10 cm in parts of the southwest, especially above the majority of Arizona.
There are sudden floods possible with rapidly worsening conditions, because the tropical rain can fall very widely.
It is strongly advised to enter the desert at foot when the tropical rainfall threatens.
The heavy rainfall can transform ravens into wild rivers, and the storm will produce local winds and dust.
The approaching trog brings locally some heavy rain to parts of the coastline of South California.
There is rain of 1.5 cm possible, which could lead to small waste streams and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the region in the rain season.
Spread tropical rains will approach Arizona Sunday evening until Monday morning, after which the rain will be spread more on Monday end of the day and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread over the Four Corners Tuesday and will continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October the temperature in the United States may vary strongly, because the North Pole is getting cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to large temperature differences over short distances.
There is a beautiful example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the persistent summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In a large part of the middle and east of the United States, it is expected that October will begin warmly, with temperatures varying around 30°C, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York, it can be 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees warmer than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the odds are high by mid-October at over-average temperatures in the eastern United States.
More than 20 million people looked at the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched one of the six television networks of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the US Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an attack allegedly taken place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, while broadcasters interrupted regular programming for Friday's surprise: an agreement arranged by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, to investigate the charge for a week.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Justice that she was 100% sure that a drunk Kavanaugh robbed her and tried to pull out her clothes during a high school party.
Kavanaugh declared in an obscene testimony that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
Probably more than the 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediate figures available for the other networks that sent the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who look at a office.
For comparison: that's about like for a play-off of a football game or for the Oscar show.
Fox News Channel, which gives all support to the appointment of Kavanaugh, had most viewers during the day of the hearing: an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3,26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the public remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, the cameras of CNN and CBS recorded that visitors screamed at him when he tried to take the lift to a hearing of the Justice Commission on Friday morning.
He stayed standing a few minutes with fallen eyes while he was embarrassed, live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
“Do you think he tells the people the truth?
Someone cried, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and just before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various broadcasters sent everything live when the judicial committee had to vote hours later on the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate.
But Flake said that he would only vote in favour with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee against the next week, something that the minority Democrats call for.
Flake was convinced, among other things, by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democrat.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flake's choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes necessary to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation on the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'a political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticized their plans to leave the European Union from a “political game” with the future of Britain and undermine national interests.
Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May arrives for the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the newspaper, the former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for the Brexit. He said that her proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's charges was 'absurd'.
Wayde Sims: police arrest Dyteon Simpson as a suspect of the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect for the shooting where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketballer at LSU, was shot to death.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is in prison on suspicion of death, said the Baton Rouge police.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the crime scene and found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, reports WAFB, a CBS television station.
The police interrogated Simpson and later declared that he had confessed that he had shot Wayde with the result of death.
His bail is fixed at $350,000, reports the Attorney.
The coroner of the municipality in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death is a shot wound in the neck.
The report states that the Fugitive Task Force of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University police and local residents have all contributed to the investigation leading to a arrest.
Sports Director Joe Alleva from LSU thanked the local police for his ‘dedication and pursuit of justice’.
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He won on average 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per race last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team is ‘kapot’ and ‘in shock’ by Waydes' death.
“This is an event you always hope it will never happen,” Wade says.
Volcano sprinkles ashes on Mexico City
The axis sprinkled by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Rampen Prevention warned the Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity was picked up in the crater and 183 gas and ashes emissions were recorded in a 24-hour period.
The centre detected several times spawning and vibrations.
In social media, photos of a thin layer of ash on car windows appeared in neighbourhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have seen an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 72 km southeast of the capital. This is the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake with a force of 7.1 hit Richter Central Mexico.
The volcano, called Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police fights with Catalan separatists on the morning of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists succeeded with the rebel police, while thousands participated in rival demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence in Catalonia which divided the region into two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were stopped by the robbery police boiled the agents with eggs and powder paint, resulting in dark dust clouds in the streets usually filled with tourists.
Later on the day, screenshots broke out with the police, and the cops picked up their cuffs to stop the fights.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups sang: ‘Do not forget, do not forgive’, while their opponents cried ‘Lang leve Spain’.
Fourteen people were treated for light injuries they suffered during the protests, reported the local press.
The tensions continue to rise in the independent region, one year after the referendum of 1 October, which is considered illegal by Madrid, but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters spoke overwhelmingly to become independent, although the rise was low and the people who are opposed to segregation boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police had tried to stop voting in the polling stations in the region, resulting in violent screenshots.
Pro-independence groups had camped on the spot on Friday night in order to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration continued, but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said that he was no longer hoping for Catalonia's prospects to become independent.
“Last year we experienced one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw how my parents were crying of joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck,' he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties achieved an essential victory in the regional elections in December, even though it was a nutshell, it was difficult for them this year to build on their success, because many of their most famous leaders are absent either in their own exile or in captivity pending a trial on their role in organizing the referendum and the proclamation of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old monteur filming the protest to support the police on his phone, said that the conflict had arisen on both sides by politicians.
"The tensions are increasing," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody at the end of last year, declared that he would take part in the European Parliament elections next year.
“A candidate for the European elections is the best way to accuse the decline in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after home was raided with a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car was repeatedly run in a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at the local time in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building themselves had been damaged.
A cross-arrow was probably also fired on the car at a given time.
Livingston wins with 1-0 against Rangers thanks to the target point of Menga
Dolly Menga's first target for Livingston gave them the victory
The PhD Livingston surprised the Rangers and made Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a series of 18 games since he was manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's target made the difference and Gary Holt's team came to the same level as Hibernian.
Gerrard's team did not succeed this season in winning an outlook during the Premiership. They have to take it on Sunday against leader Hearts, who stands for eight points on them.
But first the Rangers Rapid Vienna receives Thursday in the Europa League.
Livingston remains unhappy in the meantime. The team has won six races in his department, and coach Holt hasn't been defeated since he left Kenny Miler replaced last month.
Livingston misses chances against strong visitors
Holt's team had been able to make an advance for a long time before the first goal, because their direct way of playing caused a variety of problems with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish it with a target point. Then Alan Lithgow, who took the headball of Craig Halkett, kicked the ball over the target.
The home team let the Rangers play with great pleasure, and waited for his opportunities quietly and confidently.
And that ultimately led to the crucial target.
The Rangers allowed a free staircase and Livingston led to an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create a chance for Menga, who was scrolling from the crime scene.
At that time, the Rangers had been in ball for a long time, but the defense of the home team was incurable and target man Liam Kelly had not had much to do yet.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made it possible for Kelly to avoid a target.
Scott Pittman kicked the ball against the feet of Rangers targetman Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a goal of his colleagues from Livingston.
Continuingly, Livingston's penal shooting area was promoted, but they were refused every time. Two times a penal shoot was refused, one after Halkett's attack on invader Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
'Fenomenal' of Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They played excellently and continue to exceed expectations in their race to the top.
Their play style and the composition of their team have hardly changed since their return to the highest regions, but especially Holt deserves much recognition for the way he has pushed the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Commander Halkett was fantastic, with an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall walked on the tops of their toes throughout the race.
However, the Rangers did not know to break.
Even though they have played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final phase was not good enough (they only succeeded once in shaping the home team) and the Rangers will now realize that they should play better, because they are somewhere in the middle of the classification.
Erdogan is received with mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a bright blue sky and with a broad smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went breakfast together in Berlin on Saturday (29 September).
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to restore relations between NATO's allies.
They do not agree on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan left to Cologne for the opening of a gigantic new mosque.
Cologne is the home of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police attacked themselves for security reasons when they prevented the crowd of 25 000 people from gathering for the mosque, but many sympathizers came near to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters, many of them Kurds, also heard their voice, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
The rival protests reflect the division of a visitor praised by some German Turks as a hero and accused by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: biker dies after collision with car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred near the crossroads of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10.15 pm local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance personnel were present, but the man died on the spot.
A few months ago, another cyclist died in an airbus accident on Childers Street, about a mile from the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that police were working on identifying the man and his neighbor's family.
The road has been closed in different places, buses are redirected and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six guards wounded in case of order disruption
Six guards were wounded in a severely secured prison, according to the prison office.
The discomforts broke out on Sunday at approximately 9.30 p.m. local time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still in progress.
Specialised ‘Tornado’ guards have been deployed to resolve a situation involving eight prisoners in one division.
The guards were treated for light injuries in the face.
A spokesman of the Prison said: ‘There has been specially trained prison staff deployed for a current incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and at least those responsible are referred to the police and may have to stay behind for a longer time.'
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison director had been treated in the hospital after he had been attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the rebel police were called to prison for a serious disruption of order, attacking staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (with possible positive effects on drought areas)
It happens rarely that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen in the beginning of next week, because the remaining energy of the hurricane Rosa moves across the southwest of the desert area, which brings risks to flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden floods for the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and for the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang right above Phoenix on Tuesday. Monday night it will already rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted in a tweet that “since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the border of Arizona."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation, with isolated quantities up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to rain 3 to 5 cm, and here and there is 10 cm possible.
For areas that are not at risk of flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are very worrying, part of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial because the southwest is currently drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map on which current drought areas are identified, runs through at least 40 percent of Arizona's extreme drought, the second-highest category,' weather.com reported.
The route of Hurricane Rosa reaches the mainland through the peninsula Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa is still on an hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific, making it weakened.
It is therefore expected to arrive on Monday afternoon or evening with the power of a tropical storm in Mexico.
There may be heavy rainfall in parts of Mexico, which poses a significant flood risk.
‘A total of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,’ said weather.com.
Rosa moves north over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border with Arizona in the early morning hours on Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then be left by Arizona and south of Utah on Tuesday night.
“The greatest danger that Rosa or her tail is expected is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora, and the southwest of the desert area,” said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and waste streams in the deserts and landslides on mountainous grounds.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests on suspicion of attempt to murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspicion of attempt to kill after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured at about 4 hours local time in the Excelsior Terrace district in Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is ‘stable’.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area at night, says the Avon and Somerset police.
The police ask anyone who might have filmed something about what happened to report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh's been suffering under the community, the wrath of the Democratic Party's
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the merciless and scandalous tactic of the Democratic Party," said Trump during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that, during his appointment procedure, Kavanaugh has been constantly 'in the community, the wrath' of the Democratic Party
Kavanaugh testified for the Congress Thursday and strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he had sexually attacked her tens of years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed her allegations during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the ‘American people ‘saw the wonderful and incredible character, the quality and the courage’ of Kavanaugh that day.
“A voice to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that recognizes one of the most complete legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent state of service,” he told the crowds in West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican rise in the mid-term elections.
“One of the most important elections in our lives will take place over five weeks.
I don't take part, but actually I take part," he said.
"That's why I come all over for great candidates."
Trump declared that the Democrats are on a mission to 'provide resistance and hinder us'.
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, said a top co-worker of the GOP leadership to CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and the toll is increasing
In the event of a great earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, many of which were swept off the ground when gigantic waves crashed on the beach, said the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a festival on the beach in Palu City, when waves of about six meters high hit land at the time it began to rain. Many people plundered and the waves destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When the tsunami threat came up yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They did not walk away immediately and thus became the victim of the tsunami,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian Office for Assistance in Natural Disasters BNPB during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami also led to other dangers: he dragged cars, trees, houses, he touched everything on the land," said Nugroho, who added that the tsunami had travelled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed into a tree to escape from the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photos released by the Office for Natural Disasters show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are distorted and broken down and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal town continued to tremble by hunting.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released during the huge earthquake of Friday was about 200 times the power of the nuclear bomb that had fallen on Hiroshima in the Second World War.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, has increased the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as ‘significant’ and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were crashed.
Some fatal victims were trapped under the ruin of broken buildings, he said, about 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damage could be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication with Donggala ‘lows completely flat, we have no information at all’, said Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living,” said the Red Cross in a statement. The staff and volunteers of the Red Cross are on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,” the Red Cross said.
The organization received a lot of criticism on Saturday because she had not said that a tsunami had hit Palu, although employees said that the waves had reached the country within the time the warning had been given.
In amateur images shared on social media, one can hear how a man on the top floor of a building in panic screams to people on the street below to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
minutes later a wall of water falls on the coast and buildings and cars are dragged with.
Reuters could not verify the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power disruption that cut the communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army currently sends cargo aircraft with supplies from Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but the evacuates still urgently need food and other basic needs.
The city airport has been reopened only for aid and remains closed for the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Dodentol of tsunami rises above 800.
It's very bad.
While the employees of World Vision from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers in the courtyard of their office are looking for shelter in tents of deck, but travelled on the way to desert paintings, said Doseba.
“They told me that they saw many houses that were destroyed,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups with the difficult task started to launch emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign aid providers with a great expertise were unable to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, funding, goods and personnel from abroad cannot be authorised until the location of a disaster is declared a national natural disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It is still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
‘When the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster’, we can provide international assistance, but that status is still not declared.’
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday fell on Palu, friends and family of the missing people continued to hope that they would find their loved ones lives, like in the miracles that people like to belong to incredibly natural disasters like this.
On Saturday, a boy was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, helpers released a woman who had been trapped under the ruin for two days with the body of her mother next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian National Paragliding Team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students were also stuck in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi.
“As a veteran in the paragliding world, I bear my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon told me that the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread in the paragliding community and that in the hours thereafter he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages showed only one gray tip instead of two blue tips.
“I think that means that the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thiefs steal $26.750 during the supply of cash machine in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning, thieves stole $26.750 from a Brink employee who was filling a cash machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport police press release.
The driver had just emptyed a cash machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill him with money, says Inspector Dennis McCarthy in the message.
When he was busy, another man walked behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money ready to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspects flee, according to the press release, but the police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information on the identity of the perpetrators is asked to contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Last Saturday he announced the change on Twitter with the words “The being that is formally known as Kanye West”.
The 41-year-old West has been called Ye for a short time and used this by-name as a title for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The name change was announced in the beginning of his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her performance during the show for ‘emotional reasons’, says the maker of the show.
Ye is not only a abbreviation of his current artist name. Previously West already told that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I think ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’, said West earlier this year, when he told the title of his album to radio presenter Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, we are.
I have been overcome by Kanye, which means 'the only', to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is rather a reflection of who we are."
He's not the only famous rapper who changes his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously worked with West, has already worked with and without the link sign and the main letters.
Mexican President promises not to use forces against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised to never use military power against civilians. The country is on the evening of the 50th anniversary of a bloody repression against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use military violence to suppress the Mexican people.
On 2 October 1968, military forces fired a peaceful visit to the square, where 300 people were killed, while left-handed student movements took place throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that young people often become members of criminal gangs due to unemployment and lack of opportunities to study.
United States must double funding of A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States must double the amount they spend on research by A.I., says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for all Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this following the announcements on A.I. that come from various departments of the US government, despite the fact that the US does not have a formal strategy for A.I.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: the country wants to be number 1 in the field of A.I. innovations by 2030.
“The budget for research on A.I. would already be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in A.I.,” said Lee.
A doubling of funding can lead to a doubling of the chance that the next major achievement for A.I. will take place in the US, said Lee this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's leading A.I. companies.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that beat American Othello's best player, and later he was manager at Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese Google Department.
Lee expressed appreciation for technology competitions organized by the US government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next race would take place, because it would help to discover the following visionaries.
In the US researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, said Lee.
“China doesn’t pick up our best academics, the companies do that,” said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited the best forces of universities to work at A.I. in recent years.
Lee said that American efforts on A.I. would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
"Who doctorates in the field of A.I. should automatically be offered a green card," he said.
The Chinese National Council issued its next generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences provides financial support to employees of academic institutions, as well as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the American Ministry of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve industry and academic partners in the initiative, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million in research into A.I.
However, American legislation which should lead to the establishment of a National Security Committee on Artificial Intelligence has been in the process for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible change of name of their country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change of the name of their country in the ‘Republic of Northern Macedonia’, which would result in a dispute with Greece that has been resolved for decades and would no longer impede the Macedonian application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and says that the name of its northern neighbour means that it claims to the Greek territory, and therefore Greece vetoed against the inclusion of Macedonia in the European Union and NATO.
The two authorities concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalists believe that the change of name would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote in the referendum, and by means of a boycott campaign it is not certain that the required rise of at least 50% will be achieved, so that the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the ballot is as follows: ‘Do you support NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?’
‘Proponents of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the price to be paid is worth trying to become a member of bodies such as the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that emerged when the former Yugoslavia broke apart.
“I come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us,” said the 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, sufficient Members of Parliament have indicated that they will respect the outcome, making it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds degree in parliament.
The National Election Committee said that at 1 p.m. there had not been any reports of irregularities.
At the time, however, the rise was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent during the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
“I come to vote because it is important for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, during the referendum on the name change of the country that would open the way for NATO and the European Union membership.
For the Parliament in Skopje, the 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and placed chairs for tents placed by people who boycotted the referendum.
‘We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, not through a trail,’ said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will provide urgent investment for Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I am convinced that the vast majority is in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after his vote.
He said that a ‘yes’ as a result would be ‘a confirmation of our future’.
An opinion poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, less than required.
Another survey conducted by the hot Macedonian television station Telma TV concluded that 57 per cent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them would vote in favour.
If the referendum is to be successful, the rise must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-western government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes full defense of Brighton and scoring
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made short talks with the defense of Brighton in the Etihad Stadium in Manchester. Manchester City won the 2-0 race.
It looked like a whisper of a cent, how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine peak first played the ball in the middle field.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, straightening into the open field.
There Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He was able to pass a defender and was too fast for some others at the edge of the Brighton penal shooting area.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling was waiting.
The English attacker used his first action in the crime scene to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right-hand shoe to beat targetman Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
‘Aguero has problems with his feet,’ said coach Pep Guardiola from Manchester City to the press.
“We decided to let him play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he stood deep in Brighton's playground.
He sent a beautiful stickpass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane kept the ball with him and then sent Sterling to the second paal.
The Sky Blues player taped the ball right before he was too far.
On Tuesday at 12.55 a.m. City takes up against Hoffenheim in the group phase of the Champions League. The race takes place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in the German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to play and not make it easy for the Rockies to reach the play-off
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated for the play-off, there was not much reason to force a new start.
Nevertheless, the always competitive Scherzer hopes to play on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are consequences for the participation of the Rockies in the playoff. They are currently playing one race at the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have earned at least one wild card for the play-off thanks to their 5-2 victory against the Nationals last Friday, but now they want to do everything they can to ensure their first title.
“Although there is no longer anything for us, we can at least pitch with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this audience and the other team probably plays at the highest level I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play in that?"
The Nationals still have to announce who will be on Sunday, but they are allegedly inclined to set up Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would start his 34th, stood in the opening field on Thursday and would still pitch next Sunday, although that is normal his rest day.
Washington's right-handed shooter stands on 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump organizes meeting in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, while he spoke about the importance of the Republican rise in the mid-term elections.
“All we have already achieved is at stake in November.
One of the most important elections in our lives will take place in five weeks.
This is one of the really big elections. I don't take part, but actually I take part. That's why I come for great candidates', he said.
Trump continued: ‘We see a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now.
And they are determined to take the power back, no matter what they have to do for it.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they must push away to get power and control. That is what they want: power and control, but we will not give them that."
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to 'provide resistance and impede us'.
“And we have seen that in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “boos and cruel and false and lying”.
He named the name of the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who is a member of the Senate Committee on Justice, leading to a loud call from the public.
‘Do you remember what she answered?
Did you read the document?
Hey, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerable for people who say what they think
When Momentum's activists voted in my local party to censor me, that wasn't a surprise.
Finally, I am the latest in a whole series of Labour Members who have received that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she came up against anti-semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the motion for censure because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, about Europe, ironically enough similar issues to those in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated: 'We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.'
And that was the case during most GC meetings on Friday night during the eight years that I am already a local Labour Member.
Unfortunately, today is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a 'pleasant, softer' policy has long forgotten, if it had ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a different opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion is assessed as to whether it is acceptable to the party leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and colleagues who, as far as I knew, had a political view like me suddenly expected me to revert and take a position which I would not otherwise have agreed on, from issues such as national security to the European single market.
Every time I speak in favour of a public, whatever I say, there are shy parties on social media calling for my candidateship to be rejected for the next elections, denouncing the centre's politics and telling me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the comments to my address are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who are dealing with a flood of sexual or racist reactions every day, but who are not intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that there are apparently scaly parties considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the broad church and with every ‘motion of mistrust’ or change of selection rules the party becomes smaller.
In the last two years, I have often received the advice to keep myself in mind, not just to speak loudly, and then I would not get into trouble.
But I didn't go to politics for that.
Since 32 years ago I became a member of Labour as a school child, provoked by the neglect of the Government of Thatcher which literally collapsed my classroom, I have always advocated better public services for those they need most, both in my role as municipal councillor and in my role as minister.
I never kept my politics hidden, even at the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my policy positions and my disputes with the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the motion on Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country moves forward to a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, I have only one message, which is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidateship as a Member of Parliament for the next elections will not prevent me from acting in accordance with what I think is in your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unschlaged Ayr on the way to the top
Two late trys may have somewhat sparked the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr is rightly triumphing in this glorious competition of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They're now at the top of the ranking, the only unhappy team of the ten.
In the end, they were both their superior defense and their better opportunities that gave the home team the victory, and coach Peter Murchie was allowed to be satisfied.
“We've had it hard to do so so far during our games and we're still unhappy, so I'm a happy man,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose: ‘All honor to Ayr, they have made better use of their opportunities than we.’
Grant Andersons tried in the 14th minute, completed by Frazier Climo, led to a advance for Ayr, but by a yellow map of Rory Hughes from the Scottish national team (which he received during the Warriors race) Melrose managed to let the figures speak and Jason Baggot managed to break a try.
With a penalty for an extra advance for Ayr, Climo made a conversion after a solotry just before the rest. Thus it became 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and the try of Patrick Anderson, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the advance to five points.
The race was still for a long time for a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was carried off on a brancard, and once the race had started again, Ayr could continue with a trial of Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion of Climo.
After that, Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson got a yellow card, and Melrose recounted with the extra man when no conversion followed a try by Bruce Colvine at the end of a competition where the pressure was very high.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he grabbed Climo without the ball, MacPherson took care of a touch-down at the penalty-line-out behind the relentless Ayr mouth.
Climo made the conversion, and did it almost immediately after the reboot, after Kyle Rowe picked up the box kick of David Armstrong and halfback sent Gregor Henry away for the fifth try of the home team.
Star van Still Game is ready for new career in the restaurant world
It looks like Actor Ford Kieran goes from Still Game to the horeca. Apparently he has been appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he plays together with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the coming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor didn't want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun told me that Kiernan was looking for a way to participate in the ‘blowing restaurant business’ in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia, enclosed by the country, hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Marines patrol at a marine office in La Paz.
There is a blue sea flag on public buildings.
On all marine bases from the Titicacameer to the Amazon, the motto is: ‘The sea is ours.
It's a duty to win them back."
All over Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that the country had to give up to Chile after a bloody 19th century conflict of raw materials, is still alive, as is the desire to re-enter the Pacific.
This hope may have reached its highest point in the last few decades, since Bolivia is waiting for a decision by the International Court of Justice, which should be discussed on 1 October after five years.
‘Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and tranquility, and of course looks forward to the result with positive prospects,’ said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians throughout the country will look at the Court of Justice's ruling on large screens, in the hope that the Hague Tribunal will plead in favour of Bolivia that Chile, after decades of rude talks, is obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Also for Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia, who next year stands for a controversial struggle for reelection, much is at stake with the statement of Monday.
“We are very close to the return to the Pacific,” he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide in favour of Bolivia, and even if that were the case, little would change.
The United Nations body established in the Netherlands is not empowered to grant the Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice falls only six months after the final proceedings indicates that the case was ‘not complicated’, says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the prospects for a positive result from Bolivia have certainly not been improved, on the contrary, the situation may have even worsened over the last four years.
‘The issue of access to the sea has been dealt with by the current Bolivian government,’ said Zárate.
Morales' warful rhetoric has all the good will that Chile had perhaps still completely undermined, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their discussions at a given time, but it will be extremely difficult to continue to talk below.
The two countries have not had an ambassador in each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in The Hague, denies that the court's decision was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will ‘have an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile’ and an opportunity to ‘end 139 years of disagreement, with mutual benefits’, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, which is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the maritime issue as a political crawl.
"Bolivia will never give up his right of access to the Pacific," he added.
‘The ruling is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.’
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is not possible until it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if Washington cannot trust.
Mr Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with the promises made during a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at the time that State Secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be about to restart the nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the summit in Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says it is a 'utopia' that the permanent sanctions and the American opposition to a declaration that ends the Korean war will ever get North Korea on the knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang taking important steps in the area of disarmament.
Both Kim and the American President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is scepticism and there is doubt that Pyongyang is serious if he says he would renounce an arsenal that probably sees the country as his only way to guarantee his safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge main covers, soon for sale with you nearby
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun completely out of your eyes, do not look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of crazy oversized top covers for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a striking move during the Paris Fashion Week.
Very unpractical hats were not to think away from Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their eyeblind creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's striking piece was a gigantic beige hat decorated with a feather-like wide edge, hanging over the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories were watermelons occupied with precious stones, a magical hat and even ananas, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
With many of the colorful masks, the lips were sealed. They looked more like Hannibal Lecter than on haute couture.
One creation looked like dive equipment, complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice.
And if you want to follow this courageous mode, you have luck.
Stylewatchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing shops near you.
The gigantic hats may be inspired by 'La Boma', the straw hat with a two-metre wide edge that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very unpractical hat that appeared everywhere on social media also provided another great creation on the catwalk: a strangled beach bag that was almost as big as the model in bathing suit that sailed the bag.
The roodoranje raffia bag, put up with raffia french and finished with a white leather hensel, was the most striking piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stilist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the shops next summer. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra large accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent state of service in the field of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with a series of excellent exam results, and also individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other initiatives of the entire community.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for continuing and higher education, their chosen career and their place as world citizens.
As a educational sector that can design and implement a customized school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desired fields in high-quality schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, you reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we can not only trust English when we want to build relationships and a relationship of trust with people from other countries.
From the recent examination results of this year, we can conclude that languages are on top of the rankings, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received a high score.
The data collected from 74 schools associated with SCIS show that 72 per cent of students received a high score (‘A’) in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of students were German, 69 per cent of students were French and 63 per cent of students also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now valued as vaguely as STEM subjects (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in independent school programmes and elsewhere.
According to employers, a survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of the blocks to fill job vacancies were attributed to a lack of language knowledge.
Language skills are becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for their future career.
Now that more and more job vacancies require language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career that someone chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with such skills for life.
Communicating directly with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person a lead to competition.
According to a YouGov survey, more than 4,000 British adults in 2013 were 75 per cent unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation. French was the only language that passed over 10 per cent, with a total of 15 per cent.
This is why investing in language education is now important for today's children.
Multilingual languages, especially those of emerging economies, will give children a better chance to find a meaningful job.
In Scotland, schools themselves choose which languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important for the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest is, there will always be different languages to choose in independent schools, with teachers specializing in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills they need to succeed, regardless of the future.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages in a global business environment remain of vital importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages must actually be regarded as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
You have to do it.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut on Sunday at the Lakers in San Diego
Fans waiting for the first LeBron James game at the Los Angeles Lakers, waiting is almost over.
Lakers-Coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening competition Sunday before the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It still needs to be determined how many minutes he will play.
“There will be more than one, and less than 48,” said Walton on the official website of the Lakers.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James will probably play a limited number of minutes.
After the training earlier this week James was asked for his plans for the Lakers schedule for the six races prior to the season.
“In this stage of my career I don’t need any races before the season to prepare for me,” he said.
Period of Trump's election rallyes in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, at a long series of election rallyes
It is the first of five scheduled rallyes of Trump in the next week, including stops in places he's loved, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the appointment of the candidate he chooses for the vacancy in the Supreme Court has been pending, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections, because the Republicans are at risk of losing control over the Congress when voting in November.
What time does Trump's rally start in West Virginia tonight and how do you look online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19:00.
You can watch Trumps rally in West Virginia online via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about the hearings for candidate-up judge Brett Kavanaugh this week. These were extra loaded now that Kavanaugh is accused of sexual abuse and the Senate may wait a week to vote on his appointment while the FBI investigates the case.
But the main objective of this series of rallyes is to help the republicans who are candidates for the November elections to get more elan.
President Trump's campaign leader said that these five rallyes in the next week are intended to ‘promote volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Deputies’, says Reuters.
‘Control over the Congress is so important for his program that the president travels to as many states as possible now starts the busy campaign season’, said a spokesman of the Trump campaign who did not want to be mentioned by name against Reuters.
The evening rally in the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in the media of Pittsburgh, said West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is the second time in the last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who remains behind in the surveys.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to boost him in the surveys," said Simon Haeder, politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is ready to fight to keep the hope alive in the start to the singles of Sunday
After three unilateral sessions, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon might have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging slinger of opportunities is a completely invented sport concept, but it is one that players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this.
So who gets the best chance right now?
‘They first had a six-point advance, and now it's only four more, so we find such a little luck on our side at the moment,’ said Jordan Spieth before he left at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage that they stand for four points, while there are twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth said, find that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each three points of the four.
Spieth has been an adversary to fear from tee to green and he gives the good example.
The typical throat sounds that he makes when he plays well became louder as his round progressed and he realized a crucial pit with which the four race became a success when he and Thomas stood behind two points after two races.
His well with which they won the race at 15 was followed by a similar scream, the kind from which you can deduce that he believes that the American team has not yet been defeated.
“You have to dig deep and only worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That's all these players can do now.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
This strange, but delicious European duo has four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
‘Moliwood’ was the only duo that did not play bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning they avoid bogey's.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their rumorous audiences, they are the players who have to be defeated on Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will be the most popular player ever who wins Europe when the sun falls above Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, it is premature to talk about a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short talks with Sergio Garcia, the fourball hero of that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine led to a backlog for the Spanish and Swedish that they no longer overcame.
However, on Sunday there is no one who can help to bring your back.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can change in an eye.
The European team has played all the best so far and has a great advance in the beginning of the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA is willing to begin the fight, something that some, especially in the US, doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe begins with a beautiful advance on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and foursomes of Saturday, they are 10-6 ahead in the United States.
The duo hit Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two wins more than Tiger Woods, who had it difficult, making them have four points ahead in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to return the trophy that she lost two years ago in Hazeltine, was stronger than the blundering Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The US offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two races, but could no longer recover its backlog.
Jim Furyk's team has to score eight points during the 12 singles matches of Sunday to keep the trophies.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in row, while he and Molinari, who got the nickname ‘Molliwood’, after a sensational weekend, are only the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup that wins four points in their four opening matches.
After they had put Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they were beautifully played together and defeated a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who swept himself through two races Saturday, occasionally showed a great move, but he has lost 19 of his 29 races in four-balls and foursomes and seven in row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world, with 2&1.
Nevertheless, it was not a lean roof for Europe on this pleasant day with a brush southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the norm for the Americans on Saturday with three points.
After a difficult match with 2&1 of the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls, they defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first four holes.
It has only happened twice earlier in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to recover a backlog of four points at the beginning of the singles, although Furyk's team has enough matches, as they currently have the trophies in their hands.
But since they've been in second place for two days, a counter-attack seems to be too high on Sunday.
North Korea says that it will ‘no way’ unarm unilaterally without confidence
The North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuing sanctions lead to ever greater mistrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country could not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho told the United Nations Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken ‘important goodwill measures’ over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the location for nuclear tests and the promise not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We do not see the corresponding reaction of the US, however," he said.
‘Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will in no way unarm ourselves unilaterally.’
Although Ri reiterated the known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a ‘phased’ approach to denuclearisation, which would be rewarded as the further steps were taken, it was noted that he did not a priori reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang used to do.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on the ‘denuclearization of the Korean peninsula’ while Trump promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea seeks to formally end the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted appeals to facilitate the severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States urges ‘denuclearization first’ and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way and even by objecting to the ‘declaration of the end of war’," said Ri.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an air castle of people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the constant sanctions only strengthen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something that the American leader earlier in the week was advocating to the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: ‘If the other party to this issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such an impasse.’
However, Ri's speech was significantly different from last year when he said to the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles on the American mainland were directed after Mr. Evil President called Trump Kim a 'raket man' on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to completely destroy North Korea last year, promised Kim this year to the United Nations that he would be courageous to take steps to disarm, but said that there was still much to be done and that sanctions should remain until North Korea denuclears.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timetable for this: ‘Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, that doesn't matter.’
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, on Thursday, US Secretary Mike Pompeo said to the United Nations Security Council: ‘The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must be continued firmly and firmly until we have achieved the complete, definitive, verified denuclearization.’
Since 2006, the Security Council has implemented unanimous sanctions against North Korea to significantly reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said that he would go to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Nearly a few hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, North Korea confessed to him that he had set 'passionate demands'.
North Korea promised this month during a meeting with Moon to dismantle a rocket site and also a nuclear complex if the United States were to take ‘according measures’.
He said Kim had told him that the ‘according measures’ he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students follow a course on the importance of sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an attempt to fight the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study all night and drink a lot of coffee.
A professor found that students from the world's largest university often have no idea of the basic principles to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist associated with Brigham and Women's Hospital, opened the course. As far as he knows, this is unique in the US.
He was given the idea to start the course after he had spoken about the influence of sleep failure on learning.
"At the end of my speech, a girl came to me and said, "Why can I hear this just now, in my last year?"
She said that no one ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which is organised this year for the first time, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of University Health Services, said the university decided to organize the course when it was found that students had a serious sleep shortage during the week.
The course takes one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the components, students see an image of a sleeping room, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise equipment and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and how sporting performances are influenced by sleep shortages, and the importance of a routine during sleeping.
In another section, participants will hear how long-term sleep shortage increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Using a map of the campus, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know all of this, just as people have the right to know what consequences the choice of cigarettes has on their health, added Czeisler.
The culture of pride in a night study still exists, he says, and by modern technology and increasing pressure on students, sleep shortages are increasingly problematic.
To ensure adequate sleep, of good quality, the student’s “secret weapon” must be to fight stress, fatigue and fear, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep shortages give them a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from Calfornia, who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to prepare the course, since last year he had studied with the professor when he studied Harvard in his first year.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to everyone on the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study program before they come to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm for their bedtime, and not only an alarm to stand up. They must also be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light of electronic screens and led lighting, which can disrupt the circular rhythm, which can make you feel difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga targets the men of Gerrard
The Rangers saw their game run disappointing again when Dolly Menga scored and Steven Gerrard's weak team beat with 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibrox's team hoped for a first victory during a match since they defeated St Johnstone with 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's team made the defeat, barely the second of Gerrard as manager in 18 races. His team now stands eight points behind on Hearts, which goes on to the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored at seven minutes before the rest, and the Rangers failed to score the equalmaker.
The Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third, with only a difference in number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could have more problems, since the frontier judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after apparently throwing an object to him by the supporters of the visitor team.
Gerrard made eight changes in his team. They stopped Ayr and went to half the Betfred Cup finals.
Holt stayed at the same eleventh for Livingston, who knew the Hearts could cut a point last week. He would have been excited about how his well trained team could block the opponents at every move.
The Rangers might have had most balls, but Livingston did more.
They should have scored after two minutes, when Menga gave the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had the goal of Allan McGregor in sight, but the middlefielder could not finish it.
A deep free staircase of Keaghan Jacobs reached captain Craig Halkett, but his colleague defender Alan Lithgow kicked against the rear staircase.
The Rangers managed to take control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than really believe in it if they could approach the goal.
At least Alfredo Morelos found that he was entitled to a sentence when he and Steven Lawless struck after a quarter of play, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian request.
The Rangers could only shoot twice to the target in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who was formerly a target man at the Ibrox, could easily stop Lassana Coulibaly's headball and Ovie Ejaria's timber shot.
Livingston's opening in the 34th minute may not be in the prolonged general game process, no one can deny that they deserved this, even though it was just for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers were not discouraged against the deep game pattern of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained coldblooded and chose Menga, who easily hit the ball in the goal.
Gerrard made a break with the change of Coulibaly/Ryan Kent. This move had almost immediate consequences when the wing player Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly raced away from his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston continued to force visitors to play the kind of match that Livingston prefers to play, where Lithgow and Halkett keep trapping long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the final stage of the game, but McGregor kept good and blocked Jacobs, and Lithgow came wide from the corner.
Invaller Glenn Middleton of the Rangers asked for a penalty shot after a raid with Jacobs, but Thomson looked back on the other side.
Almanak: the inventor of the Geigerzähler
And now a page from the almanack of our ‘Sunday Morning’: 30 September 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for whom TELLEN is good... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm ‘Hans’ Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device with the name Geigerzähler.
Since then, the geigerzähler has not been able to think away from science, and also became an icon in pop culture, for example in ‘Bells or Coronado’, a 1950 film with the most unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: 'What the hell is that?'
Rogers: ‘It's a geiger counter. It's used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you set up this main phone, you hear the effect of the atoms released by radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: ‘It's really blowing right now!’
‘Hans’ Geiger died in 1945, barely a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains relevant.
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to ‘see’ and kill malignant cells
Vaccin teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells in the course of treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells in a patient to change them into a lab
They can then see a protein that often occurs in many types of cancer and then be re-injected
A test vaccine delivers promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
With the method, immune cells are removed in a patient, then the cells in the lab are adjusted so that they can ‘see’ the protein HER2 that often occurs in various types of cancer. Then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of various types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and intestinal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar way to remove immune cells from patients and to ‘learn’ these cells to tackle cancer cells appeared to work earlier in the treatment of a particular type of leukaemia.
Kanye West goes off pro-Trump-tirade and wears MAGA-pet after his appearance in Saturday Night Live.
It didn't go as he had hoped
Kanye West was rejoiced during a Saturday Night Live broadcast after an inconsistent performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would become presidential candidate in 2020.
After bringing his third number of the evening, Ghost Town, with a head with the text Make America Great Again, he turned a tyrat against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
‘Sometimes when I talk to a white man, she asks: ‘How can you have sympathy for Trump? He's a racist!’
If I was concerned about racism, I would have left America for a long time,' he said.
The broadcast of Saturday Night Live began with a parodie in which Hollywood star Matt Damon stack the dragon with the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Committee on Justice in connection with the alleged attack of Christine Blasey Ford.
The West tirade was not broadcast, but comic Chris Rock uploaded them on social media.
It's not clear if Rock wants to stick the dragon with the West with his post.
West also complained to the public that he had been taken backstage under fire for his pet.
‘They've been driving me backstage.
They said, "Don't go on stage with that pet."
They've stuck me!
And then they say I'm apathic," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see how apathic it looks?” He said he would attract her superman cape,” because that means you can’t command me. Do you want the world to be better?
Give me some love."
According to Variety, at least twice of the audience came out of a shout and the castles of SNL seemed to be embarrassed. The magazine was heard by one present: ‘The whole studio was suddenly quiet.’
West was guest as last minute replacement of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with an execution of the number I Love it while he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the leader of the Conservative Group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: ‘To one of our most courageous spirits: BEFORE YOU TAKE THE MASSA TROTSEER.’
But talkshow presenter Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just ‘seal, and that's beautiful.’
“But I choose not to reward anyone who hurts, supports and sprinkles my community (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free to do whatever he wants.
We too, added them.
Before the show began, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on, he is, "the being that is formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name. He was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Collega rapper Snoop Dogg also wore the name Snoop Lion and the deceased music legend Prince once changed his name into a symbol and then in The artist formerly known as Prince.
Prosecution of attempts to murder after a stab in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempting to murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, said the police.
The defendant is expected to appear on Monday before the police judge in Belfast.
The accusation will be investigated by the Public Ministry.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington takes out for toxic manhood
Kit Harington is known for his role as swordfighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy game of thrones of HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor goes out to the machoheld stereotype and says that young boys often think that they should be tough to get respect when they see such roles on the screen.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he felt that ‘there was something wrong’ and asked himself how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he was strongly convinced that the problem had to be addressed.
"This is really an important question for me at the moment: where has our virility failed?" he said.
"What did we learn men when they grew up, so that we are now confronted with this problem?"
Kit thinks that television could sometimes be partly responsible for the increase in toxic maleness, due to his very male characters.
He continued: ‘What is born and what has been learned?’
What is taught on TV and streets that makes young boys think they should be a certain kind of man?
I think that is one of the great questions today: how do we change that?
For there was clearly something wrong for young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he will not act in prequels or sequences of Games of Thrones when the series ends next summer, because he is ‘ready with battlefields and horses’.
From November onwards, Kit plays in a revival of True West of Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he found his meeting with his wife Rose the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife during the series, so that's how I kept my future family and life on it from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series awarded an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese people with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health authorities say that more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were transmitted through sex, which was not the case before.
Hiv has spread rapidly in some parts of China in the past by transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people in this way is now almost zero, said Chinese health officials during a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, compared with the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
The transfer of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has no longer been criminal in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is allegedly widespread.
According to studies, 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
The disease is often transmitted by inadequate protection in sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV medication in the context of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff member has leaked data from Republican senators and finds out about ‘hazardous lies’ and ‘complete theories’
The American Congresswoman Maxine Waters disagrees with the allegations that one of her staff members has placed the personal data of three American Republican senators on the Wikipedia page of the legislators.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claims that the accusations are spread by ‘extreme right’ deniers and websites.
‘Liars, liars and even more ugly lies’, Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include, among other things, the private address and private telephone number of American senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared on Thursday. They were posted by an unknown in Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate Committee on the allegations of sexual abuse to the address of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court.
The leak came after the three senators Kavanaugh had interrogated.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address that indicates the source of the posts was linked to the Waters office and contained the information of a Waters employee, said the Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie," said Waters.
‘My employee, whose identity, personal data and security are compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie."
Waters' statement was quickly criticised online, including by former press staff member of the White House Ari Fleischer.
‘This denial sounds angry,’ said Fleischer.
“Here you can realize that she has no temperament to be a congressman.
If someone is accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't be angry.
He shouldn't be rebelled.
He should not question the reasons of the prosecutor.
He must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer appeared to compare the reaction of Waters to the criticism by the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of excessive anger during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take Waters' place in the mid-term elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
"Happy, if it's true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the relevant services and law enforcement authorities of these false accusations.
“We will make the perpetrators known,” she said, “and they will be legally held responsible for all their actions that are devastating and dangerous to my staff.”
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parodie with Rowan Atkinson
In every new British film we are now traditionally looking for references to the Brexit, and that seems to apply to this revival of the Johnny English-franchise, the comic action movies with a sleepy spy in the main role, which started with Johnny English in 2003 and was relaunched with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Is this airy evenatire about how bad we do it the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with his eyes rushing and flexible faces, at least, manages to send everything in a hundred, even with his second comeback. From his name you can already distract that he is a commonly funny character that was designed for cinematographers in countries where one speaks a language other than English.
He is, of course, the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim of smooth glamour, has a little Clouseau, a little wing Mr. Bean and a grip of that guy who contributed one note to the theme number of Chariots of Fire during the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
He is originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man that Atkinson once played in the TV spots of Barclaycard (which everyone has forgotten in the meantime) who always leaves a certain chaos.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I liked how Johnny English approached a helicopter in his medieval armor and tipped the rotor blades against his helmet.
Atkinson can well show in this film how much talent he has for physical comedy, but the humor is rather weak and crazy enough, especially now that the "harsh" movie series like 007 and Mission Impossible itself include comedy as an ingredient, and do that right.
The humor seems to be intended for children rather than adults, and Johnny English's stupid disaster is less original and focused on me than the jokes without text of the character Bean playing Atkinson.
The constant theme now is that Britain is in great difficulties.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super secret spy network on the web, which has made the identity of all active secret agents of Britain known to be a great dismay of the agent in service, a unfortunately small role of Kevin Eldon.
That's the drop that makes the eagle of the Prime Minister, a pretentious woman with problems at her head and terriblely unpopular as politicians. Emma Thompson does her utmost with this character that reminds Teresa May, but the script does not offer much material to work with.
According to her intelligence advisers, she has to use a retired spy as every active spy is compromised.
And that means the stunting Johnny English himself, who is now working as a school master in a chic institution, but inofficially teaches about undercover work. Here are fun jokes in the story, because English's spy lessons are thinking about School of Rock.
English is quickly invited at Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former sad helper Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is a captain of a submarine, an insulting and joviale role under Vicki Pepperdine's level.
So the Batman and Robin of the calamities of Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's bloody woman fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, unfortunately, the Prime Minister is in charge of the charismatic technology billionaire's charismatic charisma which claims to be able to solve British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start with their odyssee of ugly doll fun: dressed as a waitress, they fire a vivid French restaurant, they kick rehearsal on board the luxury hunt of Volta and English develop pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
For that last one, all the records are opened, but no matter how well-intentioned and unscrupulously the scene is, she is thinking about child television.
It's not all very original.
And as with the other films of Johnny English, I ask myself: can't the British film sector really think of a role that honors Rowan Atkinson's talent?
Labour denies that the party is thinking of a plan where the British work four days a week but are paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party would consider a radical plan where the British work four days a week but are paid for five days.
According to the party, managers of companies would like to transfer the savings they do as a result of the Revolution of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) to their employees by giving them an extra day of vacation.
For example, workers can enjoy a three-day weekend, but still earn as much.
According to sources, the idea of the party's economic agenda and the plans to bring the country's balance to the direction of workers are ‘passing’.
The transition to a four-day working week has already been approved by the Association of Trade Unions, which finds it a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A high-ranking source from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: “A policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not take place from one point to the other, but a four-day working week is an objective that fits within the party's efforts to make the balance sheet in the economy more to the benefit of the workers and that also fits within the party's overall industrial strategy."
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given that the Green Party has already promised a four-day working week in the 2017 country election campaign.
However, the entire Labour Party has not yet supported the aim.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not a political intention of the party and is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to make his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy clear.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of the 'visualless drivers' and the 'profiters' in utilities.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover the full value of their share, because a Labour government could apply 'reductions' on the basis of observed misconduct.
He also confirmed that there were plans to include employees in the boards of directors of companies and to set up inclusive ownership funds (Inclusive Ownership Funds) which would give 10 per cent of private sector companies’ shares to employees who could earn up to £500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh can change their minds
The FBI investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question whether the findings of the FBI could ensure that Republican senators can withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview sent on Sunday at '60 Minutes', correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI to discover something that might change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open in this than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said before the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusation came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, unambiguous."
However, Graham's voice seems to be walled.
"My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is firm and the accusation should contain dynamite," he said.
"When it comes to Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one called by her could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I do not see any new developments."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up of stars will take place and which has an equally impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time again, tens of thousands of people for the Global Citizen Festival will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to create awareness for the real goal: to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was held for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international stakeholders who hope to put an end to poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against this.
Concert visitors who wish to obtain a free ticket for the event (unless they were prepared to pay for a VIP card) had to complete a series of tasks, or 'action', such as volunteering, e-mailing a world leader, holding a phone call or generating another meaningful awareness for the purpose: an end to poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with another 12 years to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert an appropriate way to convince people to demand an action call or is this just another form of 'clictivism', giving people the feeling that they make a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million 'actions' by supporters, which were aimed at a large number of different goals.
According to Global Citizen, these actions have contributed to the commitment of world leaders and policy proposals worth more than $37 billion that have to change the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
Early in 2018, the group quoted 390 initiatives and statements based on the actions, of which at least $10 billion has been paid out or brought together by sponsorship actions.
The group estimates that the funds obtained so far have had an impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
One of the most important declarations of intent is that of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives from the United Kingdom with the aim of 'to help children realize their full potential'. This group has promised Rwanda $35 million to help stop undernouncing in the country after they had received more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, other national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make a note in history of the social injustice that is underfeeding," Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, told the audience during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that after more than 5,000 actions had been sent to the British Government to improve the nutritional situation for mothers and children, the government has announced to support a project, the Power of Nutrition, that will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the Global Citizen website asking "Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
The group replied: "It will be a long and difficult way, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, just like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will eventually be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform this year during the event in New York presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the Navy for a 'blockade' to impede Russian energy exports - Minister for Home Affairs
Washington can 'if necessary' resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from coming on the market, including in the Middle East," Ryan Zinke, the US Minister of Home Affairs, stated by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where the country acts at the invitation of the legal government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe they are only in the Middle East to act in energy, as in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe," he said in the report.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to counter this.
"The United States has that possibility, with the Navy, to ensure that the shipping routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them in order to ensure that their energy is not on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to invited persons during an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without a profit that displays itself as the 'vote of the energy consumer' in the US.
He continued and compared Washington's approach to Russia with Iran's approach and noted that these did not differ substantially.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuels," he said and referred to Russia as a country that only knows a 'art', with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump government is trying to stimulate the export of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a country that far from offers the cheapest option for European consumers.
For that reason, Trump government officials, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw sight from the 'inappropriate' pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump of Berlin, has made Moscow's 'inmate'.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth 11 billion dollars, which will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is simply an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is sent only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we agree with the view that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers themselves," said Aleksandr Novak, the Russian Minister for Energy, after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Minister for Energy in Moscow in September.
The American position has triggered a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), the leading industrial organisation in Germany, has called on the US not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third power interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'thinks seriously' to take part in the presidential elections in 2020, says Senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts said on Saturday that she's thinking hard about taking part in the presidential elections after the mid-term elections.
During a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering taking part in the elections.
"It is time for women to go to Washington to restore the damaged government, and this also means that a woman in the top position," she said, according to the political news magazine The Hill.
"After November 6, I'm going to think seriously about making myself elected president."
Warren performed against President Donald Trump at the meeting in the city hall and said he "sends this country in the wrong direction".
"I'm up to the bone worried about what Donald Trump is causing in our democracy," she said.
Warren has been open in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Naturally, we have to wait for an investigation from the FBI before we vote on this."
However, an opinion study published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own support felt that it should not be optional by 2020.
Eighty-five percent of the 'probable' voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be elected, according to an opinion study by the Political Research Center of the Suffolk University and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of them were for her to be elected.
The investigation showed that there was more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent in advance of a possible candidateship and 48 per cent against.
Other names of leading Democrats associated with possible participation in the presidential elections in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator from Vermont.
Biden said he would officially take a decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's PTSS at a Donald Trump election meeting
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after taking a job in September.
He was arrested and charged after a report of domestic violence on Monday night.
"With what my own son has to experience, what he is experiencing when he is back, I understand other families who experience the consequences of PTSS and the injuries with which some of our soldiers return," she told the audience who was present at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans "they come back a little differently, they come back and become harder, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all the other soldiers have given for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was accused of domestic violence and attack on a woman, involved in a report on domestic violence and possession of a gun under influence, according to Dan Bennett, police officer in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 States support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eighteen States and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new policy in the United States which refuses asylum to victims on the run for gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and Washington D.C. submitted a statement last Friday as a 'friend of the court' to the Washington court to support an asylum seekers who contest this policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace vs Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union brought against federal policy in August has not been announced.
She says that her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a gang" abused her but that American officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
The lawyers of the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people came from seeking asylum in the United States, as countries with major problems in the field of gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals, which made it possible for immigrants without documents on their flight for domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the Attorney General of Washington D.C., said on Friday in a statement that the new policy "misses ten years of state, federal and international law".
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and that obstacle is contrary to that principle" is set out in the declaration of the 'Friend of the Court'.
The lawyers further argue that the policy that denies immigrants access to the US will damage the economy of the United States, because these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and provide the country with the necessary labour force.
Jeff Sessions, the Minister of Justice, ordered judges in June to no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
"Asian is available for those who flee their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political view", says Sessions in his policy announcement on 11 June.
Asia was never meant to alleviate all the problems, even if these problems are serious, with which people are dealing around the world every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of dead doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It feels very excited," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, trying to comfort her fevery baby in an evacuation centre in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
And clean water is scarce."
Inhabitants came back to their devastated homes and searched for valuable possessions that they could still use.
Hundreds of people have suffered injuries and hospitals have been overpopulation, provided they have not been damaged by the 7.5 earthquake on the Richter scale.
Some injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to the risk of severe nasal shocks.
His tears filled his eyes when he told his feelings when the devastating earthquake shake the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was printed against the remains of a wall," Haris told a correspondent of the Associated Press and added to it he was with his family in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, and later I didn't hear anything.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they're safe."
Ambassador of the United States accuses China of 'intimidation' with 'propaganda advertising'
One week after an official Chinese news magazine put a four - page ad in an American newspaper, in which the mutual advantages of trade between the US and China were encouraged, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of the use of the American press to spread propaganda.
The American President Donald Trump last referred to China Daily's paid annex in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after he had accused China of interference in the US Congress Elections of 6 November, an accusation denyed by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the US elections, according to American officials quoted by Reuters, marked a new stage in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign authorities to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, in which they have imposed increasing import tariffs on each other.
China's retribution rates early in the trade war were specifically designed to meet exporters in states like Iowa, who support the Republican Trump Party, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the ambassador of the United States in China and formerly long-standing governor of Iowa, an important exporter of agricultural products to China, said that China had affected American workers, farmers and businesses.
"China", as Branstad wrote in an opinion in Des Moines Register of Sunday, "doubles the intimidation by publishing propaganda ads in our free press."
"By spreading this propaganda, the government of China uses freedom of expression and free press, a long-time tradition in America by placing a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, you will find in vain different votes at a kiosk in the centre of Beijing and you will not see any true reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese people have on the difficult economic path, because the media are firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent news magazines refused to publish his article", when he did not say to which news magazine this was.
Through the Kavanaugh debacle, the Republicans alienated female voters from themselves just for the mid-term elections, warning analysts
Now that many important Republicans are around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, defending him against various allegations of sexual violence, analysts warn that they will suffer a fall, especially among women, during the forthcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions about this subject have grown enormously, and most Republicans have already indicated that they want to continue voting.
"These things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, Professor of Politics at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, at The Hill for an article that appeared on Saturday.
Reeher said he was wondering if Senator Jeff Flake (Republican, Arizona)'s attempt to plead for an FBI investigation at the last moment would be sufficient to satisfy the angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday, they didn't forget it tomorrow, and they didn't forget it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and country spokesman for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday, according to the Washington News Release, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters called "November arrives!" during their demonstration in the Senate hall while the Republicans who have chosen the Justice Committee under control to approve the candidateship of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record height," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the news site.
"Men say it's already high, and that's true.
But it can go even further, especially among floating female voters in the outskirts and younger voters, from 18 to 29 years old, who often do not vote even if they disagree with the President."
Even for Ford's public testimony, in which she further explained her accusation of sexual harassment against the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that there might be a reversal if the Republicans pushed the appointment.
"This has become a confused mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican Party, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote in committee, or about the final vote or that Kavanaugh takes place in court, but it's also about the way the Republicans have handled it and how they have treated it," makes Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group helping Democrats to be elected, clear to the news channel.
However, the Americans appear to be divided into the question of who they believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority on the side of the latter.
A new opinion study by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents are sure or likely to believe the testimony of Ford and that 35% are sure or likely to believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh certainly or probably lied during his testimony while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's promotion, the FBI is currently investigating the charges of Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee last week under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her his genitals during a party during the time they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plants a new internet to address Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inruptt, the latest project of the technology legend, is a company based on the open source platform Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid offers users the opportunity to choose where their data is stored and which persons have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee laughed that 'world rule' is the leading thought behind Inrupt.
"We have to do this now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historical moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to make their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
In this list, lists of contact persons, lists of activities, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools can be stored.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together via one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it depends entirely on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data".
The idea behind Inrupt is, according to CEO John Bruce, that the company delivers the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of voluntary programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not going to talk with "Facebook and Google about introducing or not a complete transformation which puts all their business models in their heads at once".
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the mission (of Inrupt) is to deliver commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute even after the start of Inrupt.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: spiritual and supporter of the Victoria Cross honored from WO I
The only spiritual of the Church of England who acquired a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a military is honored 100 years later in his place of birth.
Lieutenant-colonel, the honor Bernard Vann received the distinction following the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, four days later, he was killed by a sniper and, therefore, never knew that he had been part of the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was revealed by his two small sons during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the small sons, Michael Vann, said that it was "brightly symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the fact for which his grandfather was distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant-colonel Vann led his battalion on September 29, 1918 over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense mist and under heavy fire from fire and machine guns".
He later stormed to the fire line and led the line forward before he ran only to a field shot and switched out three members of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, a little more than one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something that I know I can never put on it, but also something that makes me feel humiliated."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he felt very honored to be able to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support he receives from a large number of people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, you've stayed awake all night to watch a follow-up Bellator 206 and you don't get the most important moment to see.
On the postcard from San Jose 13 battles were mentioned, including six in the main section, and this was broadcast throughout the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready for their fight, viewers in the United Kingdom were unpleasantly surprised when the transmitter switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were indignant because they had stayed awake all night especially for this fight.
A fan described the transition to the child program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
"According to government regulations, no content that is not suitable for children should be shown after 6:00 a.m., and that is why we had to switch to the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, senior Vice President for marketing and communication at Bellator, when he was asked for the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," yesss."
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator, said they were going to adjust their programming to ensure that the viewers in the United Kingdom also had a chance in the future.
"I think, with a view to the retrieval, we can solve this problem," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the changeover, many text texts went back and forth and believe me, these were not all as kind.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that wasn't the case, it was a public problem.
I can promise this will not happen again.
We limit the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he felt inferior during his youth because of his sexual orientation, but that this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The twenty-five-year-old said that until he went to secondary education, he did not realize that 'not everyone is like me'.
In a conversation at Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also said that parenthood had contributed to lower value in winning during the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-term show has taken off for a few months because of disease.
Looking as a swifting on Laverne's first program, Daley told me he felt "less" than others during his youth because "socially not accepted to like both girls and boys".
He said, "Today these feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different are real facts that have given me the power to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "someone" so he wouldn't disappoint people if they finally found out his orientation.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals has become an outstanding campaign leader for the LGBT community and used his presence at the Australian Joint Games this year to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he thought he was happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, who he met in 2013, "surprised me completely".
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than he, but said that age difference had never been a problem.
"When you are so young," he took part in his first 14-year-old Olympic Games and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone in your own age group who has experienced the same heights and lows.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "full perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he had received the diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked if they had already received the tickets before London 2012, because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't get it about my heart to say, you won't be there to sit in the first row, Dad'," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breath was actually stuck and he died, I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
Next year Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I knew I had dreamed of this all my life. To dive for a home audience during the Olympic Games, there is no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first music choice, Proud by Heather Small, that had strongly attacked him on the way to the games and where he still got chicken fur from.
Desert Island Discs can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, on the couch during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he must find his shape back to make it not a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who took part for the 12th time in the two-year event, a record, was placed on the bank by team captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and exercising on the driving range, in an attempt to find out where it is suspended.
Because even at the top of his career he never was known for his straight drives, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the narrow fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the roughs disturbing balls routinely punishes.
And if the job itself isn't awful enough, Mickelson will come on Sunday in the ninth match the always accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, against which is linked to newer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who are behind four points at the beginning of the 12 single matches, start well, Mickelson's match can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk has proved to have confidence in this man, although he could honestly be difficult to change.
"He fully understood the role he had today, knocked me on the back, hit his arm around me and said he was ready for it tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is included in the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two matches.
I expected more, but it's the way it is and it's the way we had to act.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson can improve Nick Feldo's record on Sunday for the highest number of played Ryder Cup matches.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never fully met the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson has won 18 matches, 20 lost matches and 7 matches on his name, but Furyk said his presence had a certain invasive influence on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's captured, he likes to make jokes with people and he's a great guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players liked to keep him up for the fuck last week, that was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than only his game."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that great advance can disappear quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable advance before the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
The Danish debuted in the race in Valderrama in 1997, where the team with Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advance on the Americans, but eventually passed the finish line with the smallest possible margin: 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You continue to remember that we had a great advance in Valderrama; we had a great advance in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just," Bjorn, called out here, after he had seen the 2018 lighting win with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, good for a advance of 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history shows me and everyone else in the team that this isn't a game yet.
Everyone will have to make a full commitment tomorrow.
Go to work and execute the plan on the right.
It's not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to win this trophy, and we must continue to focus on it.
I continue to say, I focus on the 12 players we can have, but we are also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world."
Rejoiced by the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never advance on the business in this area.
Tomorrow is waiting for a new challenge.
Tomorrow, the individual achievements will be discussed, and that is another very different discipline.
It's great to be out there with a partner if it's okay, but when you're alone, your capabilities as a golfer are only really tested.
That's the message you need to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go, and he also has to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform individually better than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who conquered three of the four points.
Furyk himself has experience with both sides of this kind revert on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Miracle of Medinah'.
"I remember every damn word of that speech," he said in answer to the question how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had picked up his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches for the bog tomorrow, but let's try to start well, like in Brookline, or like in Medina.
When we have the momentum, there will be a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We aligned our line-up on this and sent the men in the order that we think is the best and, you know, we're going to try to magic something out of the high hat tomorrow."
Thomas has the task to try to lead the counteroffensive and put Rory McIlroy in for the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battle order.
"I have chosen this group in this order, because I think we are so continually covered," Bjorn said of his selection of single players.
The new German warship is delayed
The latest fregate of the German Navy should have been used in 2014 to replace the outdated warships from the time of the Cold War, but it will take at least one year before it is ready, due to defective systems and rising costs, reported local media.
The launch of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class fregats, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the news magazine Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship should have been part of the Navy in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 are intended to replace the obsolete fregats of the Bremen class.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a series of air defence and anti-ship missiles and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic features.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to use the latest fregats up to two years in a row, far from home ports.
The continuing delays, however, mean that the advanced warships, which are intended to allow Germany to project its power overseas, are already outdated by the time they are taken into operation, notes That Time.
The desolate fregat F125 took all the headlines of the newspaper last year, when the German Navy officially refused to launch the ship and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
There is little knowledge about the reasons behind this return, but German media quoted a number of crucial 'software and hardware defects' that would make the warship useless if it were deployed in a fight mission.
Software defects were particularly important because the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the manpower on the fregats of the older Bremen class.
It was also clear that the ship is suffering from severe overweight, which will reduce its performance and reduce the fleet's ability to carry out further upgrades.
The 'Rheinland-Pfalz' weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as many as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price card for the entire project, including the training of the crew, becomes a problem.
It is said that this has reached a dizzying € 3.1 billion compared to the original € 2.2 billion.
The problems that the latest fregats have in their hands are becoming particularly important due to recent warnings that the power of the German Navy is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the Parliamentary Defence Committee in Germany, acknowledged that the Navy had "a lack of operational ships".
The official said that over time the problem has grown as a snowball, because old ships were removed from operation but no replacement ships were delivered.
He complained that none of the fregats of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were available to be included in the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research carried out on a estate in the Scottish highlands attempts to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will give new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland follows the ordinary and small dwarf flea, brown large ear flea and water flea at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed on key locations around the estate to monitor the activities of the bats throughout the season.
NTS employees and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations using hand detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the cries of the flea mouse and what type of thing does.
Then a map of the habitat and a report are produced to make a detailed picture of their behaviour on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Protection Advisor, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are the most important for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as making weeds and how we can best maintain forests for bats and similar species.
Fleece populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect sleeping places and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, like fly catchers and certain chemical treatments of construction materials and attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo-location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight route.
At the NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, bats are taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts who regularly investigate, carry out inspections of sleeping sites and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even set up the first and only reserve for flea mice in Scotland at the estate Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten types of flea mice in Scotland live.
Landscape manager David Thompson says that the estate is the ideal territory for the bats.
"Here in Threave we have a great environment for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many very old trees and the right habitat.
But so much about flea mice is not yet known, and that is why the work we do here and at other locations will help us to understand better what they need to dig."
He stressed the importance of controlling flea mice before maintenance work was carried out, as the possible unconscious destruction of a sleeping place could lead to the death of 400 female flea mice and their boy, possibly eliminating a complete local population.
Flea mouses are a protected animal species and it is illegal to kill them, to fall into trouble or to disrupt them or to destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, has asked the public to make a contribution to help.
She said, "We still need to learn a lot about our bats and of many of our species we simply don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo rejects charges of assault while his lawyers are ready to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo charges of assault qualified as 'fake news' and said that people want to 'promote themselves' by using his name.
His lawyers are about to accuse the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the charges have been published.
The tip of Portugal and Juventus is accused of the attack of an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of having paid her $375,000 to silence about the incident, reports Der Spiegel on Friday.
Through a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33, a few hours after the charges were reported, called the reports 'fake news'.
"No, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man, and through and through good" added the footballer, smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a trial in which they want to prosecute Der Spiegel for the charges they called "unacceptable reporting of suspects in the field of privacy".
Christian Schertz, lawyer, said that the footballer wanted compensation for 'moral damage for a amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years'.
The alleged incident was reported to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting each other in a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the football room, where he violated her anallysis according to the charges, as read in the charges filed at the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and that he told her that he was a 'good guy' for '99 percent', but that he was sometimes abandoned that 'one percent'.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the couple had sex, but that this was mutually acceptable.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that there were photos of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an extrajudicial arrangement because she was ' afraid of the consequences' and because she was worried about the 'public humiliation'.
The 34-year-old now says she wants to invalidate the scheme because she has been permanently traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to go from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack and this summer he left to the Italian giant Juventus in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: the United Kingdom will be 'forever regretting' when car manufacturers leave
The United Kingdom 'will regret it forever' if it loses its position as world leader in car production after the Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister for Economic Affairs.
He added that Toyota UK had said to the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily shut down production in the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays at the border in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit' would cost jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, where the Auris and Avensis of Toyota are made, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"My vision is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March, we will see production in our factory shut down," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed their fears about the consequences of a departure from the EU without agreement for the operation of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already reported that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most car manufacturers are concerned about risks in the supply chain in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit'.
Toyota's production line is based on the 'just-in-time' principle, where every 37 minutes parts of suppliers arrive in the UK and in the EU for cars made on order.
If, on 29 March, the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there may be anxiety at the borders that, according to industry, could lead to delays and shortcomings in parts.
Toyota cannot store more than one day in stock at the Derbyshire factory, so the company informed, and therefore production would be discontinued in that case.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was 'justly adapted to avoid such border controls'.
"We need to have a deal. We want the best deal, which will not only enable us to continue our current success, but also take this opportunity," he told the listeners of the Today program of BBC Radio 4'.
"The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, is that we must be able to continue with this very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term it warned that the additional costs would affect the company's competitiveness and that it would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working with Burnaston for 24 years and is a representative of the Unite trade union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs have been lost, they never come back.
A spokesman of the government said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Meeting of Trump and Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be postponed 'only a week' while the fight about the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian influence of the elections, links between Trump's assistants and Russia and possible obstacles to the trial by the President.
The question whether Trump is going to fire the Deputy Prosecutor General and thereby jeopardise Mueller's independence has kept the Washington robbery machine running for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to record conversations with Trump and to terminate the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, rumors made the round that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he wanted to dismiss Rosenstein 'do not love', but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing of the Senate Justice Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would both witness.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh, which delayed the vote in the entire Senate.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, Trump's press manager, appeared at Fox News.
Asked for the meeting with Rosenstein she said: "There is no date for it, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed another week, given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always want to keep the press informed."
Some reporters had difficulties with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the scarcity of press conferences was not caused by a rejection of the 'reasonable' TV journalists, although, she added: "I will not deny that they are trying to draw attention."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president is doing more questions and answers than any president for him," she said, without providing proof of this, "we have looked at the figures."
Press conferences will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, that is infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do that much, and you have seen us do so often in recent weeks, and that will take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he takes part in public sessions or during press conferences with dignitaries visiting.
Press conferences with only the president are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, he made an open-hearted and at times bizarre appearance for the collected reporters.
Health Minister writes a letter on Brexit to NHS Scotland employees from other EU countries
The Health Minister wrote a letter to the EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and wish to continue working with the NHS after the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter of less than six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish government has already expressed its willingness to bear the costs of applying for a fixed status for EU citizens working for decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "In summer the negotiations between the UK and the EU continued, and this autumn the expected decisions will be taken.
At the same time, however, the UK government has also postponed preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is reached.
I know this should be uncertain times for all of you.
I would therefore like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff, regardless of their nationality.
Members from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the NHS's work and provide benefits to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing an emergency surgery after head injury
The linebacker of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, received an emergency operation yesterday after he had suffered a major injury in the 31-27 lost competition against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tennessee.
Rod Reed, the chief coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident took place shortly before rest.
"He came to the sideline and fell down there more or less," said Reed.
The trainers and the medical staff gave Abercrombie directly oxygen on the sideline before they put him on a stretcher and took him for further research.
A Tennessee State officer told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had come out of the surgery room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are still no details about the type/size of the injury and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury has occurred.
Butcrombie, a 'redshirt sophomore', is in his first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He was knocked five times on Saturday before leaving the field, making him knocked 18 times this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher leases when they buy a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher leases when they buy a home in the UK and the income is used to help the homeless according to new plans of the Conservatives
This action will have to neutralize Corbyn's success to attract young voters
The increase in leases is levied on persons who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects this to raise £ 120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher leases when they buy a home in the UK and the extra yield is used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn, which attracts young voters with promises to ensure more affordable homes and to tell them about them.
The increase in the leases is levied on persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra revenue being borne in an attempt by the government to combat homelessness.
The surcharge, which comes above the current leases, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second houses and houses purchased for rent, can be up to 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to £ 120 million a year in this way.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the new building in London is purchased by people who do not live in the UK. This raises prices and makes it difficult for starters to get a foot on the housing charger.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become practically 'spook cities' due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson had advocated a reduction in the leagues to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices high by buying land and not using it, and he called on May to abolish quotas on affordable homes in order to restore the 'dwelling shame' in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a remarkable series of housing reforms, including rent ceilings and an end to the expulsion 'without neglect'.
He also wants to give local authorities more opportunities to build new houses.
May said, "I said last year that I wanted to spend my time as Prime Minister on the restoration of the 'British Dream', that life will be better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market needs to be restored.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build a life.
However, it cannot be as easy for people who do not live in the UK and for foreign companies to buy homes here as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of having a house has ever become a too vague dream and the humiliation of life without a roof above the head is too real."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Jack Ross, Sunderland's boss, says it's his 'ultimate ambition' to ever become Scottish manager.
De Schott, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from the northeast of England, which is currently third in League One, in three points of the first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after returning to the Scottish Premiership the last season of St Mirren.
"As a footballer, I wanted to play for my country.
But I was selected for the B team, and that's how it was," Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
"When I was a child, I often saw my father and Scotland play in Hampden Park and it's something that keeps wearing me.
However, that possibility would only come if I were successful in managing a club."
The predecessors of Ross as managers of Sunderland include Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says he was not intimidated to become the successor of these established names in a large club, before he had refused advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me is measured at this moment by "can I let this club return to the Premier League?"
Due to the structure and facilities of this club, it is definitely part of the Premier League," he says.
"It's not a simple task to achieve this, but I can only see myself successful if I bring the club back there."
Ross is only engaged in his career as manager for three years, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from degradation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from the edge of degradation to win the Championship in the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable than he ever did during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably really a crossroads," he remembered the moment he took the lead at Alloa.
"I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds weird, because I did best fine, I deserved fairly well, and I knew a few reasonable highlights.
But soccer can be heavy.
There's a lot of things you're confronted with every week.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the job, but management just feels good.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now that it's really me, I'm so good in my field, as I've never felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, revealed research
The heat wave in summer has made the revenues rise from British pubs who have difficulty in survival, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw sales rise by 2.7% in July, but the revenues in restaurants were 4.8 per cent less, the figures show.
Peter Martin, from the CGA Business Advisory Office, who collected the figures, said: "The continuous sunlight and the fact that England took part more than expected in the world championships, meant that July showed a similar pattern as June when the pubs had 2.8% more turnover, with the difference that the restaurants were hit even harder.
The decline of 1.8 per cent in the turnover of restaurants in June, only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars focused on drink sales were the best, with a better LFL growth (like-for-like) than the restaurants went down.
Pubs also targeting the sale of food members also of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
Looks like people just went out to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, drinking sales were 6.6 per cent higher for the month, while food sales were 3 per cent lower."
Paul Newman from RSM, an analyst for the leisure and hospitality industry, said: "These results continue the trend that we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of important social or sporting events remain the main factors for turnover in the outlet market.
It is therefore not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a turnover of 4.8 per cent per year is particularly painful given the constant cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse moment for food operators and will only learn the time if the more moderated temperatures of August can give the necessary response."
The total sales growth in the pub and restaurant industry, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the decline in the introduction of new brands.
In the Coffer Peach Tracker, the sales monitor for the public, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, performance data are collected and analysed from 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of £9 billion. This is the established benchmark of the industry.
One in five children has a secret account for social media that they keep hidden from their parents
One in five children, some not older than 11 years old, has a secret account for social media, which they keep hidden from parents and teachers, reveals a survey
Survey of 20,000 students from secondary schools revealed growth in 'false Insta-pages'
This news has strengthened the fear that sexual content is posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a head account that they also show their parents
One in five children, some not older than 11 years old, makes accounts for social media that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students from secondary schools revealed a rapid growth in the 'false Insta-accounts', a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
This news has strengthened the fear that sexual content is posted.
Twenty percent of students say they use a clean 'head account' that they show to their parents, while they still have personal accounts.
A mother who accidentally came to the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered there a teenager who asked others to ' rape' her.
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters and Headmistresses' Conference) of independent schools, discovered that 40% of the 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles and half allowed them to keep personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said, "It is alarming that so many teenagers are attracted to creating online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers."
Eilidh Doyle becomes the voice of the athlete in the Scottish Council for Sport
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Council of the Scottish Sports World, as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the job and in the field and president Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for sports leaders to learn from her extensive experience at international level over the last ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the athletic community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will benefit enormously from her election in the Council," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I am happy to be able to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope I can make a contribution and help control the sport in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 meters and the 400 meters during the 1996 Games in Atlanta, two of his four gold Olympic medals, and now regularly commenting on the BBC, could no longer walk after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today, a month ago, I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only the time will learn if I will recover and to what extent.
It's been awful hard work, but I've been completely restored, I've learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all the support statements!"
Breast pump advertising comparing mothers with cows, distributes online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has distributed the online opinion with an advertisement comparing mammals with dairy cows.
In order to mark the introduction of what is called the 'silentest portable breast pump in the world', Elvie, a consumer technology producer, has issued an ironic ad inspired by music videos to illustrate the freedom that this new pump has to offer to piston mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn filled with hay on a song containing texts like: 'Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see anything of it' and 'If you didn't see it, these aren't owls, these are my breasts'.
The refrain continues with: 'Pomps, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the lady'.
However, the advertisement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, immediately caused an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has attracted hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say that the 'horror' of the dairy industry is rewarded.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like we, they must be expected and pregnant to produce milk, but in their case the babies are removed within a few days after birth" is written in a reaction.
Elvie’s breast pump fits discreetly in a dietary behave (Elvie/Mother).
Somebody else noted: "This is of course traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another person added: "This ad is so far from reality."
Others defended the advertisement and a woman admitted that she thought the song was 'hilarical'.
"I think this is a genius idea.
I'd buy one if I still breastfeeded.
Those pumps gave me the feeling of being a cow.
The ad is a little weird, but I haven't been looking too much for it.
This is a genius product," someone wrote.
Somebody else had the following comment: "This is a funny ad, focused on moms who have punches (often at work or in a toilet) and then have the feeling of being just 'coughs'.
This advertisement does not leave itself at all positive or negative about the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their behaves.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who are pistons sometimes feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump, however, is completely quiet, has no wires or snakes and fits discreetly in a nutritional behave, so that women have the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they are on pistons.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother said about this: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a tough and provocative introduction.
By comparing piston mothers and milk cows, we wanted to put the piston and the associated challenges in the shiners and at the same time show in a maintenance and understandable way how the new pump will provide an incredible sense of freedom.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump gets the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared at the catwalk of Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of migrant children in detention has reached a peak, although the number of monthly cross-border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and the harsh policies introduced by the Trump government make it more difficult to bring children to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and are afraid of their own chance to remain at risk in the country by registering for a child.
This risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households should issue their fingerprints and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declared in a testimony to the Congress that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have registered as sponsors of unaccompanied minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested had no previous criminal record.
"Bijna 80 percent of the sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegal in this country and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
We are pursuing these people," said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to expedite the treatment of children, officials have introduced new rules, which require some of them to appear before the court within one month of the beginning of the detention, rather than within 60 days, which was the standard, according to the staff at the shelter
Many of them will be before the court through a video conference instead of in person to plead their application for legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not eligible for aid will be deported quickly.
The longer the children are detained, the greater the chances of anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to escape, according to the shelter staff and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that these concerns are stronger at a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs of a child fighting are more often ignored because of the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare themselves emotionally for this or to say goodbye to friends can contribute to the trauma many of them are already fighting with.
Syria recommends that the US, France and Turkey 'occupied forces' withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, the Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem also called on the Syrian refugees to return, even now that the war in the country is in the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign troops are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that 'this will be dealt with accordingly'.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the "war on terror" has almost passed in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been rooted and expelled from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue "this sacred battle until we have freed all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from "possible illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, which are mainly involved in training and advising the Kurdish troops and the Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the country broken by war.
With regard to the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are favourable to their return and he called on 'some Western countries to spread irrational fears' which keep most refugees away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They politise a matter that should only be a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebels' hub, has created the opportunity to start political talks.
The Russian-Turkey deal has dismissed a major attack on the province of Syrian troops supported by Russia, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that this agreement knew 'clear deadlines' and said that he hoped that the military action would focus on jihadists, including fighters of the Al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front, who would be 'exterminated'.
Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations Member, hopes to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to draft a constitution for after the war against Syria and to build the way for elections.
Moualem made clear the conditions for the Syrian Government to participate in the committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited to 'to review the articles of the current Constitution' and he warned against external interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the elections in 2020 unless, as many 'liberal' viewers are likely to hope, his presidency is prematurely terminated by a settlement procedure and scandals.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic final of a presidency ever".
However, at the moment there are no signs of visional fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN's “prime-time” viewing figures have more than doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million to MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during 'prime-time', compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and 'The Rachel Maddow Show' from MSNBC is at the top of ratings for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers in nights with important news.
"This is a fire that attracts people, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the responsible behind the ABC drama "Designated Survivor" a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitool.
Nell Scovell, an experienced writer of comedy and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why?
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
There's entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, unlike on TV, the story lines coming from Washington can influence the future of Roe v. Wade or determine whether immigrants families can reunify or influence the status of the world economy.
Disable is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond wanting to be a well-informed citizen, when you notice that you have been looking at a panel of experts since six hours discussing the use of sources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', who talk about the jack of Paul Manafort's pople leather that has cost $15,000 ('a garment full of overthrow' according to The Washington Post) and discuss the implications of the colorful description by Stormy Daniels of the, uh, anatomy of Trump.
At least I will never be able to look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"What he's doing to give you the idea that it's a reality show, is partly that he gives you something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the maker of 'Pawn Stars', about the rotating role distribution of the Trump show and the daily sudden changes (a fight with the N.F.L., Kim Jong-un lobbies).
You can't afford to miss an episode or you've got the idea that you're behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside looking at MSNBC while he took CNN.
He couldn't get rid of the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh who had to appear before the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember that we were doing all those weird shows, not so long ago, and that people said, "this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right."

Outside money flows in the most exciting mid-term elections for the House of Delegates
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees an abundance of money, thanks to a rescheduling of a constituency which requires two sitting representatives to fight for the same seat.
The recently reclassified district of Pittsburg meets the Democratic People's Representative Conor Lamb, who acquired his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb must take it against another sitting representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, who has many overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps have been reclassified after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January found that the old districts were inconstitutionally classified ('gerrymandering') in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a knot party in the field of campaign financing between the financial poor of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a niche victory in a well-viewed special election for the 18th electoral district of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been occupied for more than ten years by a Republican and President Donald Trump had conquered this district by 20 percentage points.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The U.S. considered to punish El Salvador for support to China and abandoned this
Diplomates noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized and had received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he had a hotel in Panama until his partners dismissed the Trump Organization management team.
Officials of the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided to call back the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the 'current decision not to recognize Taiwan', said Heather Nauert, the spokesman of the Ministry, in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were only considered in the case of El Salvador, because the country received $140 million US aid in 2017, for control of narcotic drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have become painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high murder rates.
While the internal meetings continued, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in preventing migrants from leaving the United States.
But in mid-September, some of the government's top officials informed that they wanted the conference to continue, making all possible sanctions against El Salvador impossible in advance.
The plan is now that Vice-President Mike Pence holds a speech at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance that the government attaches to the meeting, say diplomats.
And the three U.S. messengers have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further relentlessness, without strong messages about Washington's sanctions.
A spokesman of the White House on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussion subject to anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is also close to the government and also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next step may be the report of the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible countermeasure of the trial by Trump, for which serious evidence has now become public.
Mueller's research will probably also focus on the conflict between Trump's campaign and Russia in an attack by Russia on our elections.
If the Congress changes color, Trump has to blame himself for that institution, just as he is ready to turn back to the voters, and maybe he should go to the court for a jury.
That is a lot of condition, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trump is inevitable, nor that of its equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, which will determine how long the battle will take.
In 1938 German officers were ready to carry out a 'coup d'État' against Hitler, but only if the West had offered resistance and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and thus missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history is around such bending points, and the unprecedented progress of democracy is being accelerated or delayed.
Americans are currently confronted with various such bend points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the time when this paper reported that he had suggested, last year, to include conversations with the President in secret and that he had speculated on the suitability of the President for his duties.
Rosenstein says the Times report is not correct.
"How will we react if the new investigation by the FBI on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or unfair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of assault and an unfair testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will call Trump for responsibility?
If we fail in these tests, democracy is waiting for a very long winter.
But I believe we will not fail by the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador home.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me, 60 years later, to ignite candles for the sabbath on the table where a swastika was shown.
With that as my inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the race against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday and know that a victory on the Austrians, after the impressive equalspel in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, places them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
Through a kneeblessure, civilfielder Graham Dorrans could not play his first seasonal match until the 2-2 match at Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers who can use the results as a springboard for better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good eleven," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the idea that something was to win and came out with a point.
Maybe we could even have won at the end, but seen over the whole game a equal game is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but when we came out in the second half, we were the better team.
The coming Thursday is a new big European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points but it's going to be a difficult match because they also had a good result in their last match. But if the audience goes behind us, I'm sure we can push through and get a positive result.
Last year has certainly been heavy, of everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a feeling-good factor on the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can now push through, leave the last season behind and get successful again."
Women can't sleep because of fear of their retirement
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they want to receive care, few people discuss this with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationalwide research said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
And only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about this.
"Men would like a family member to take care of them, but they do not take the necessary steps to conduct this conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
Here we start.
Talk to your husband and the children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not make your wishes known properly in time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, because these choices can be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Take a financial adviser in the arm: Your adviser can also give you advice on how you can pay these expenses.
Your long-term financing options may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenditures, or use the own funds as insurance, as long as you have money.
Set up your legal documents: Avoid legal struggle when the insurance must be used.
Ensure a competent authority for health care so that you can designate a familiar person who can oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Also consider a mandate for your financial affairs.
In that case, select a trusted person to make financial decisions on behalf of you and ensure that the invoices are paid if you can't do this yourself.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your older father or mother meets a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medication and allergies in that case?
Set these details in a written plan so that you have the information at hand.
"It's not just financial matters that are important, but who are the doctors?" said Martin.
"What drugs are used?
Who cares for the dog?
Make sure that plan comes."
Fired several times with air pressure gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air pressure gun when he walked home after a night out.
The victim, forty plus, was in the Oxford Grove neighborhood of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Agents described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a 'willing act'.
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami hit by the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, said officials, and the expectation is that the number of deaths will rise further.
Since the means of communication have been disabled, the official authorities have not yet received information from the Donggala Regentship, a region north of Palu which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th birthday when the tsunami was on.
Donggala is a precipitation that extends over 300 km along the coast of northwest Celebes.
The rainland, a administrative region just under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the province of Central Celebes, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been regularly affected by tsunamis over the past hundred years, according to the Indonesian Agency for the Prevention of Disasters.
In 1938, a tsunami called for more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck in the west of Donggala in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often affected by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the most serious earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh on north Sumatra on 26 December resulted in a tsunami that struck 14 countries and has demanded a total of 226,000 lives along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes took place on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a force of 6.8 on the scale of Richter took place south of Java, the densest populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that attracted on the south coast and almost 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake with a force of 7,6 on the scale of Richter hit the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people found death.
2010: An earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the scale of Richter hit one of the Mentawai islands, on the coast of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and demanded about 300 human lives.
2016: A deep earthquake hit the Pidie rainland in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, because people were reminded of the destructions of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people found death through decaying buildings.
2018: Several earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, where more than 500 people were killed, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and made thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for accusation of domestic violence
Track Palin, Sarah Palin's oldest son, former Governor of Alaska and candidate for the Vice-Presidentship, was arrested for accusation of domestic violence.
Palin, 29 from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, interference in a report of domestic violence and opposition during the arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female well-known person tried to call the police to report the alleged offense, he took her phone.
Palin is detained in the Mat-Su detention house with a security deposit of $500, reported KTUU.
He appeared before the judge on Saturday and declared himself 'innocent, sure to know' when he was asked for this, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A infringements, which means that he can be sentenced to one year in prison and to a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B offence, which is criminal with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not for the first time that Palin is charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017 he was accused of being mistreated by his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, then called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case is now for the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of abuse in the domestic atmosphere, interference in a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon affected by the incident.
His girlfriend said he had beaten her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised in 2016 by a veteran group after having linked the violent behaviour of her son to PTSS that he would have spent his service in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale has led to a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks are disabled while the expectation is that the number of deaths will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake took place next to the center of Celebes, northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are videos circulating on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for suspects of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York demand the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, where eight were killed, a rare penalty that has not been enforced in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, according to the charge, used a rented truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he drove away pedestrians and cyclists coming on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious physical injuries, according to the declaration of intent requiring the death penalty, which was filed in the Southern District of New York.
The death penalty is possible for both charges, according to the document submitted to the court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury approved the charges with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for a racket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organised crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and preparation" according to the prosecutors and described the way Sajpov executed the attack as "awful, cruel and corrupt".
"Sajfoello Habiboellajevitsch Sajpov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" states in the statement of intent.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It was more than ten years ago that a case occurred in the Southern District of New York where the death penalty was required.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was ultimately convicted of life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple executed after they had been convicted for spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Sajpov, from Uzbekistan, did not show any reluctance in the days and months following the attack, according to the legal documents.
He told the detectives he felt good about his act, she was the police.
Sajpov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the charge.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room, told the police.
He did not plead to be guilty of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said he was 'naturally disappointed' with the prosecutor's decision.
"We think that the decision to require the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt in exchange for a lifelong prison without the possibility of release will only extend the trauma of these events for all those involved," Patton said.
The defense of Sajpov had previously asked the prosecutors not to impose the death penalty.
Conservative MEP says that NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to mobilize a 'public army' during a protest at the Conservative Party Conference.
The former leader of Ukip said that politicians should feel the 'hit' of the Euroscepticists, while one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians suggested that he should lead negotiations with the EU.
The conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the participants on March in Birmingham that the UK would have been 'out of it' if Mr. Farage Brexit had been Minister.
But the challenge for May to reconcile the highly divided ranks is highlighted by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and participate in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise on track while this is being attacked by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Others insisted that she would continue and try to conclude a deal with Brussels despite the failures, and thus force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to throw "Chequers in the garbage basket."
He proposed that Farage should be ridden and that he should be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he did the service, we would be out now," said Bone.
Wellingborough's Member added: "I will support Brexit, but we must throw Chequers in the trash."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone clearly made suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely untrue."
The conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the March and told journalists: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote in favour, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists who go from door to door and make sure that we are elected.
Drop Chequers and listen."
In a targeted message for May, she added: "Premiers keep their job when they keep their promises."
Farage told the meeting that politicians should feel the 'hit' if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to say to them, "We're not gonna let you get out of this."
In a message to the enthusiastic mass he added: "I want you to put the fire on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We mobilise the people's army of this country that has brought us the victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have again become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime Remainers walked through Birmingham and concluded this March with a two-hour meeting in the city center.
A small group of activists swung with flags on which Tories Against Brexit stood, after the creation of this group in the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Higher House, made jokes about the security problems of a Conservative party app at the beginning of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can provide IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for the friction-free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is not something like a good Brexit," he added.
Warren intends to 'good thinking' about presidential candidateship
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she'll be going to think well about her presidential candidateship after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts told about her future at a meeting in a city hall in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, Republican delegate who was co-chairman of the Trum campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been the center of speculation that she would possibly fight with Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a city hall since Trump came to power.
One present asked her if she would be elected for the presidential office.
Warren replied that it is time for women to go to Washington to restore our defective government and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest after shooting Wayde Sims from LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, told Saturday that a suspect was arrested after shooting Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They gave a video free from the shooting incident on Friday and asked to help identify the man in the movie.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a shot in the head and died of its consequences," said police commander Murphy J. Paul to the press on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been interrogated and has confessed to have been present at the crime scene, in possession of a firearm and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incidents and is detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a junior player of 1.98 meters who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 matches and started the last season in 10 matches. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Fattel left him the victory after orders of team
When Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes's team orders would play a role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from pole position and left Hamilton almost completely in the cold when he defended his position and Vettel invited his teammate to attack.
Fattel went into the pit and let Hamilton drive in the bust in the tail of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the pit later and came out after Fattel, but Hamilton came back on the head after a wheel-on-wheel action, which allowed the Ferrari rider to release space on the inside after a double movement in the third curve.
Max Verstappen started from the last place and was the seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He was the leader of the race for a long time, because he stayed at his tyre choice and drew for a quick finish, so that he could pick up Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Finally, in the 44th round he went to the pits, to he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen became fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri was doing his best all weekend. He was a real gentleman and left me.
The team has done its best for the places one and two", Hamilton said.
That wasn't a good body language.
President Donald Trump spoiled Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election meeting on Saturday about the fact that she did not continue to be the source of the leaked letter from Christine Blasey Ford, in which the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was accused of assault.
Speaking at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not talk directly about the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Justice Committee. Instead, he told us that what happened in the Senate showed that people could be 'against, unpleasant and untrue'."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful show that takes place in the Senate in the last few days, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and cruel and cruel, and unpleasant and untrue," he said.
"When you look at the press releases and the leaks and then they say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you lie?
Do you remember her answer... did you read the document? "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't lie."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't leak," he added to this, in an imitation of the senator.
In July, the letter mentioning the charges to Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein by Ford and it was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that her office was the leak.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't lie her story," Feinstein told the commission, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to deal with it confidentially and I treated it confidentially, as she had asked."
But the President proved not to believe her refusal and he commented on it at the meeting on Saturday evening: "I will tell you something, that was not a good body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In addition to defending the candidate for the Supreme Court, who is accused by three women of sexual abuse, the President suggested that the democrats use the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power, with all the necessary means.
You see the community, the inconvenience, they don't give anything about who hurts them, about whom they should drive to take power and get back control," the president would have said, according to a Mediaite report.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made the loss of Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had taken the lead with two goals by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier scores.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team along before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard made the equalmaker for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen set the victory with two goals.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had to make a loss on Friday night to defeat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, where the Giants won the previous three races.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 at Kendall McFaull's assist. David Rutherford gave the assist with which Beauvillier doubled the jump, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan returned the home team to the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt made the promotion for the equalmaker of Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants took the first rest with an advance when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team picked up and Bouchard brought them back to the same position as a power-play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then well combined to help Nielsen to lead Dundee for the first time, late in the second period. He made the victory with the fifth goal for his team, halfway over the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies while ensuring that hundreds of people can escape the earthquake in an aircraft
An air traffic leader in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died because he made sure that a plane with hundreds of people could get on board safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many have been missing after a heavy earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that then caused a tsunami.
Powerful after-schocks are still thrilling the area and many are buried under the point in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild traffic storms moving backwards of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He continued to make sure that flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was ready at the time on the runway, could rise safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic storms when he thought it was crashing.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision might have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News from Australia.
We arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning, before the helicopter had reached Palu.
"It breaks your heart when you hear it," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can rise to thousands of people and the country's disaster control agency knows that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"Man assumes that the number of deaths continues to rise because many bodies were under the ruin and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman of the agency.
Wells that reached a height of six meters have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral ceremony will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini markets are being plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is involved in a race to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday and he said to the present soldiers: "I appeal to all of you to work day and night so that all the tasks required for evacuation are completed.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year, with more than 550 people left alive.
Flight crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline carrying out the flight crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that one man is missing after they had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had left the sinked plane safely.
Air Niugini said in a press release that one male passenger is missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they worked with local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew members, after the aircraft had reached water during the landing at the airport of the Chukie countries.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been brought to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that the condition of everyone was stable.
What has caused the crash and what is the exact order of the events remains unclear at the moment.
Both the airline and the US Navy say that the plane landed in the lagoon and missed the landing track.
Some witnesses believe the plane was shot over the landing track.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the plane approached the airport very low.
"That's good news," said Jaynes.
Jaynes told me that he and some others succeeded by waving the water that came to their means to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the stewardsses were in panic and screaming and that he had a not serious head injury.
The U.S. Navy announced that seafarers working nearby on a yard also helped rescue work by bringing people to the coast with an inflatable boat before the plane further fell in the about 30 meters deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that in the last 20 years 111 persons have found death in crashes of air carriers registered with the PNG, but that does not relate to Air Niugini.
Analist sets the timeline of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor closed his claim on Friday in the reopening process of a man accused of the living burning of a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice, made a few hours of testimony as a witness-expert in the field of information analysis.
He made it clear to the jury how he had used mobile phone call data to capture the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, in the night she left her life.
Rowlett told me that he had received the location data from various mobile phones that showed that Tellis was at Chambers on the night of her death, which was contrary to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was at Chambers while he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went back to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was standing in the witness bank Saturday and told me he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked Tellis to tell the truth when he told me he was in his truck at Sanford that night, Sanford said he was lying 'cause my truck was in Nashville'.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told me he knew Chambers about two weeks when she died.
The cell phone data indicated they only knew each other one week.
Rowlett said that Tellis knew the texts, calls and contact details of his phone some time after Chambers died.
"He knew her from his life," Hale said.
The defense begins on Sunday with the final arguments.
The judge said he expects the jury to start the deliberations later that day.
The High Breed: What is 'conscious hiphop'?
A hiphoptrio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol submits that hiphop is alienated from origin with political opinions and addressing social problems.
They want to return to the roots and make 'conscious hiphop' again popular.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently had a resurrection in Britain by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
A New York kidnapping woman demands a couple for the judge because of a 'racist' text
A New York kidnapper challenges a couple for dismissal for discriminatory reasons, after receiving an incorrectly sent text in which the mother complained about 'a black guy again'.
The couple denies being racist and calls the court 'pressure'.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed her anguish when she discovered that the new child girl, Giselle Maurice, was a negroid woman when she met her on her first working day in 2016.
'NEEEEEE WEER ZO'N ZWARTE', Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she would rather send it to Ms. Maurice twice.
According to the American newspaper the New York Post, the 'uncomfortable' Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Ms. Maurice when she realized her blunder, explaining that her previous childhood nephew, who was an Afro-American, had done a bad job, and that she had therefore expected a Philippine.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a working day and was then sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice demands the couple for the court to receive compensation of $ 350,-- a day for the 6 months for which she was hired to intern with the family, though without a contract.
"I want them to feel that you just don't do that," said Maurice last Friday in the New York Post, adding: "I know it's discrimination."
The couple bit away from the claim that she was racist by saying that it was reasonable to fire Maurice after, by insulting her, they were afraid that they could no longer trust her.
"My wife sent her a message she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said husband Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone who had insulted you, even if it was accidentally?
Your newborn baby?
"Don't you get out of here."
About the trial with 'pressure', Plasco said that his wife was expecting a baby in two months and 'in a very difficult situation'.
Are you going to prosecute someone like that?
That is not so sympathetic," the investment banker added.
While the trial is still in progress, the public opinion is quick to kapitulate the couple on social media, where it is reproached for their behaviour and reasoning.
The publishers of Paddington feared that the public would not have much interest in a talking bear, reveals newly appeared letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the approval of the book, said about the letter: 'It is difficult to stand in the shoes of someone who read it for the first time, before the first publication.
With what we know now about Paddington's huge success, it's very enjoyable."
She told her father that, before he was inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, as a cameraman working at the British BBC station, she was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book "bittersweet" felt after his death last year.
About Paddington, which she describes as "a very prominent member of the family", she told that her father was secretly proud of the final success.
She said, "He was a quiet, modest man."
'But because Paddington was so real for him, it almost seemed like a child's performance; you're proud of being done nothing for it yourself.
I think he was about the success of Paddington.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he made the bear himself for success."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Immediately after the landing, her daughter had been taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life in vain.
"Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that she would not be able to do it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then came Nad's call to say she'd die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be back together soon.
I'll be with you again.
The medicines that the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping, were slowly developed out and left her body.
She had died some time before, and this process put everything out.
I could just sit there, knowing what was going on.
I couldn't be sorry, screaming or crying, because I was in the middle of all kinds of people and families.
I really had to keep up."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning the death of her daughter, stepped in the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what test she had to do.
"No one knew," she said.
"I sat down with my head and the tears kept coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I got an overwhelming feeling of compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Woman women put messages on the bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost their loved ones by suicide make themselves strong to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys plug in inspiring messages and phone numbers that people in need can call for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs. Davis, her son, Tyler, was 13 when he first became depressed and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like how I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney in the English county of Gloucestershire, tells her son was a promising chef with a sparkling grin.
"He was famous for his smile.
They always said that his smile illuminated every room."
Yet he already stopped working for his death because he was deep in the well."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old, found him after he had robbed himself of life.
Mrs Davis said, 'I constantly worry about a chain reaction.'
Mrs. Davis made the cards; 'to let people know that there are others you can go to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't shut up - talk about it."
Mrs Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs Davies for years, lost Mark who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt dark or depressed or something," she said.
'A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was completely on the ground on the first Christmas day - when the kids took out their gifts he didn't look at them at all or something."
She said his death was a big trauma before they, but they had to handle it: 'It breaks the whole family apart.
It's breaking us apart.
But we all have to go on and continue to fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future uncertain while FBI research starts
'I thought that if we could actually get together what he asked for; a study limited in time and scope, we might be able to create a little more unity', said Mr Flake last Saturday, to which he added, that he was afraid that the committee was falling out of one another, in the middle of a firmly anchored patrol within the party.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance has everything to do with timing.
The mid-term elections have been in five weeks, on 6 November, and if, as expected, the Republicans do badly, their attempts to obtain their husband in the highest court in the country are severely complicated.
George W. Bush has already called with members of the American Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and so his wife Ashley, who was the Bush his personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI gets the report ready?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where currently 51 republics and 49 democrats are sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count on at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would allow Mr Mike Pence, Vice-President, to give the decisive vote to confirm the appointment of Kavanaugh to the High Court.
Number of commuters in North Korea 'down' under Kim
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean runners to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un got power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, who quotes from data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, declares that there were 1.127 overlapers last year, compared with 2.706 in 2011.
Mr Park noted that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher penalties for smugglers were the main factors for the decline.
Pyongyang has not responded publicly.
The vast majority of overlapers from North Korea are finally offered the South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flew through China, which has the longest external border with North Korea and where you can make the crossing easier than in the highly secured demilitarized zone (DMZ; Demilitarized Zone) between the two Koreans.
China is more likely to consider and force them as illegal migrants than refugees.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still formally capable of war, have improved considerably over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, mainly talking about the stagnated negotiations on denuclearisation.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore in June, where they largely agreed to work towards the nuclear dismantling of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US of the lack of progress in lifting the US sanctions since then.
'Without faith in the US's action, there is also a lack of confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no first step in unilateral disarmament,' said Mr Ri during a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and finds him incompetent to serve at the Supreme Court
President of the House of Deputies, Nancy Pelosi, named candidate judge at the American High Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', and finds him incompetent to serve at the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the comments in an interview, Saturday at the 'Texas Tribune Festival' in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help think that if a woman was to behave like that, they would call her "hysterical", Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the accusations that he would have sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional; sometimes he screamed almost and was especially upset when he told about his family and high school.
He also strongly condemned the democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him 'great and coordinated character murder', organized by liberals who were angry with Hillary Clinton's loss of presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi declared that she found Kavanaughs' testimony to be inappropriate to serve the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudices against the democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he speaks about the Clintons and the Democrats," said Pelosi.
Pelosi protested when she was asked whether she would try to set up an impeachment procedure against Kavanaugh if he was appointed, and the democrats would get the majority in the House of Deputies.
"That is what I can say; if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress, or to the FBI, he's not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he serves now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District of Columbia District Court (mostly abbreviated D.C.) District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned that Kavanaugh will go against the 'Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade' (the law on affordable health care), because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh ignored questions about the revision of certain decisions of the Supreme Court during the confirmation hearings.
"Do not expect us to be happy when a hysterical, prejudiced person is now appointed in the Supreme Court", says Pelosi.
Women just have to admit this.
It's a just tirade of months and years of wrath that passes, and she can only cry to get it out.
"We're going to cry when we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?"
She continued: 'I was enormously helped by a woman who was somehow in charge and who told me she was going to cry when she became angry. She developed a method, always when she became angry, she was going to cry. To the woman she was talking to, she said, 'You might think I'm sad because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept crying.
I just thought that was brilliant."
Tårs are partly allowed as expression of anger, because crying is essentially ununderstanded.
One of my best remembered memories from a former job, in a man-dominated office, is when I had to cry terriblely because I was so angry. An older woman, a dead business leader who was a little afraid of everyone, caught me in my neck and drove me into a staircase.
"Let's never see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're glad they got you in the closet.
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Colorado Congress for Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart on his presidential candidateship.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was involved in an extramarital relationship on board a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally means that 'kattenkwaad' or 'apenstreken') and retired from the race, the deeply disappointed Ms. Schroeder felt that there was no reason why she would not apply for herself.
"It wasn't a thoughtful decision," she told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already 7 other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about "Snow White and the seven dwarfs."
Because the campaign was already advanced, she was behind with fundraising, so she promised she would not be involved if she could not spend $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give men $1,000, wanted to give her only $250.
"Maybe they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech, in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings - of gratitude for the people who had supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to collect money, and to reach voters instead of delegates, and of anger about sexism - that she put in it.
'Men will have thought I had a nervous drowning,' she remembered how the media reacted to her.
'They'll have thought Kleenex was my business sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my tombstone?
"She was crying?"
How the US-China trade war can benefit Beijing
The opening balances of the trade war between the USA and China were disturbing, and although the battle has not yet been fought for a long time, the long-term gap between the two countries could, according to experts, be beneficial for Beijing.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, earlier this year gave the first warning by raising taxes on important Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation became known this week when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed for $200 billion (EUR150 billion) of goods; half of all goods coming from China to the US.
Beijing has taken retributions in nature every time, most recently by increasing rates from 5 to 10% for $60 billion in US goods.
China has promised to match the US every time, and the world's second largest economy is probably not going to flash quickly.
In order to bend Washington, requests must be accepted, but public bending for the US is far too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that if Beijing plays it smart, the trade war with the US, China could be positive in the longer term, by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could bring one of the two countries into an economic free fall is actually far more dangerous than viewers have recognized before", says Abigail Grace, a researcher of the 'Center for a New American Security', a think tank specializing in national security issues, focusing on Asia.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, says Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed by a more than seven-year war.
During his speech to the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, declared that the conditions in his country were improved.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists and to normalise the situation on the ground.
All the circumstances are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures which threatened their daily lives and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have escaped their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that some six million people still live in the country, who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in the restoration of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had subsidised the revolt.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the '2018 Ryder Cup' by defeating the American team with an end score of 16.5 against 10.5 on the golf course 'Le Golf National' southwest of Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the Danish leader Thomas Bjorn's team won the required number of 14.5 points to defeat the US.
The star of the American team, Phil Mickelson, who was fighting almost the whole tournament, left his long beat in the water at par 3, hole 16, and admitted his loss of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, shine in all his rounds and became one of the four players who ever won 5-0-0 since the current tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by the lowest score of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The top-class player on the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to play from Ian Poulter from Great Britain, who possibly played his last match in the Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Segrio Garcia, veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
"I'm not crying so soon, but today I can't do anything about it.
It's been a difficult year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help,' said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passed the fake to his landmate, John Ram, who beat the American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole to go into the game for singles on Sunday.
"The huge pride I feel because I defeated Tiger Woods. I always followed that guy when I grew up," says the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four races in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics from one of the biggest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team fought the weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a high level throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of his team, the American leader, Jim Furyk, said: 'I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
We have made Europe a little more difficult this morning.
We offered resistance.
All respect for Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
We're going to regroup. I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their leader.
You have to take off your hat for the opponent.
We're overplayed."
Red gloed update: Concentrations decrease in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The most recent report of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (Florida Commission for the Conservation of Fish and Fauna) shows a general decline in concentrations of Red Gloed in parts of Tampa Bay Area (on the West Coast of Florida in the United States).
According to the committee, there is a fragmentary increase in the Red Gloed in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which could indicate a decrease in concentrations.
The Red Light extends over an average of 200 km coastline, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee counties.
There are about 16 km to see spots on Hillsborough County coast, but in less places than last week.
Red gloss was also seen in Pasco County.
Medium concentrations have been reported on the coast of Pinellas County last week, low to high concentrations on the coast of Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations on or off the coast of Sarasota County, background to high concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations on or off the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
