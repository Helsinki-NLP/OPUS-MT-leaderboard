The UKIP remains who refuse those who live with HIV are a perfect example.
You're talking about when Nigel Farage says that NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the United Kingdom to make health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks him whether the people living with HIV are included in the side effects.
First, you use specific arguments and then discredit them by a barely sailed homophobia.
Every time I or my family need the NHS, we have to do the tail behind intolerants to chronic hypocondria who think that everything is due to them.
I think it's you who use specific arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by right-hand crazy, is virtually not in existence.
I believe that is what we call democracy.
So no one would be affected by UKIP measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
There is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quote from a torch does not constitute evidence.
Yes, so shoot the messenger.
The Mail didn't write the report, he only commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for propagating such a populist propaganda as if it was the reality.
I don't think you know what a specific argument is.
You don't know anything about my personal situation or my identity, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate by accusations of homophobia.
Farage's phrase was a lot surprised, but only because we are so rarely talking about this problem.
He did absolutely not make any homophobic remarks.
You're going to have to get back to it.
I'm not sure what you want to do, but I guess you don't like when the media talks about what you don't like.
It is so rarely talked about because, contrary to Farage and his crazy disciples of Thatcher who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection of their own inability to understand that the complexity of humanity is something good, then not.
Finally, the situation is as bad in Ireland as in Spain.
With the new crisis that arrives in the austerity period, nothing has arranged.
Hoping almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland's ''TIGRE OF EUROPE'' was begged to us a few years ago.
We've seen the next one!
This again began reading the article.
It is attempted to believe that Ireland is a decent country and that a '' NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE'' is happening.
With the Brussels agreement, impots on the lowest societies in Europe, a flexible work path, an emigration that continues.
With these ingredients not what ''pavoiser'' for the moment with the arrival of the Poles.
In the twentieth century, irresponsibility was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with the Portuguese Considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
The Grece was in front.
That their development has not been a long quiet river, it is clear from recent events.
Lowest impot rates in Europe?
That's wrong!
Latvia has a 0% interest rate on enterprises.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the part of policies on impots actually paid by multinationals.
If one believes that a report was issued in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% in France in general.
Only SMEs pay full pot.
Now I confirm that the road traffic has returned enormously, and there are new (and expensive) cars all over the street corners, just as before the 2008 crisis.
I have lived in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery has been obvious in the daily locks since the return.
Is that supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon ignite.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a hanging on the A140.
Does Ryanair now plan to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of aircraft, so some bows and stripes on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That said, I'm flying with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of those two once rafistoled.
Then it would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair pay a supplement to passengers for the additional fear that was well intended to provide them?
But without such an Irish company, you could not afford to leave on holiday, young man
I never took Ryanair and the last 3 times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers a quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can make themselves happy.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of people's comments that would never take Ryanair in the place of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay something other than the basic tariff have to take on themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what will be the delays and whether it will be necessary to compensate passengers and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was an error of airport air traffic controllers.
Passengers were placed in another aircraft in less than one hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
I'm sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome on board this British Airways flight that takes the English ISIS to Syria, not as you say.
Good trip
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrian, and literally groove from the world.
People do not come in mass for the quality of the restaurants (some conques, mostly) nor for the magazine Salon at the Space des Blancs-Manteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly buzzy).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is amazingly alive and lively.
With many foreigners who spend .....
Do you think Sunday's opening will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where shops are open on Sunday, full of world with 50% tourists.
@aloes False!
The only argument that I think is acceptable is that of areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists, and it is nuanced by the fact that they buy in tax.
Tourism areas lose a considerable volume of business each year for the same reasons .
Stays in the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sunday, allows to lower prices.
Dominical rest is a right for employees, except for exceptions.
This is why it is planned and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister for Economic Affairs nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs have any competence to reform the Labour Code.
While they're shutting it up.
What does the law mean?
To satisfy some of the population and companies who want to work on Sunday .
In Montreal on Sunday apm I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my City of 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is access to culture ...
And that is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he has defended with enthusiasm against fascism

What if her daughter's inheritance was, against her will, used to pay her inheritance fees?
There are paintings.
Some are good, others are not terrible.
Probably his succession would like his part of the cake, if you give me the expression.
his preference for a victory of nationalists/Franco in the Spanish Civil War...
And his hostility to the independence of places such as Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and also add his well-known hatred of Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
Neither do I.
But for five years, and only for five years, it was perfect.
In 1940 he held the head of the other government aristos who wanted to discuss a "deal" with the Nazis and he won very skillfully.
Thanks to his beautiful rhetoric and his energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium, and ultimately the whole world, can thank God for having had for these five years, just these five years, Churchill at the bar and nothing else.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell paintings on the free market to collect the money from the inheritance expenses, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, they will gather the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use tax money.
No one can deny that when it was "the moment of truth", Churchill's personality was a positive advantage for his country during the Second World War.
A revival of the internal market through public works will only favour large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, since infrastructure sites are by definition low-renewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the Minister, they clearly reflect the real franky evil: the mistrust of dialogue
Back to Princeps values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
Let the weakest of us not be in need!
Either solidarity we come to his help, or he has LIGHT in exchange for the services that he provides or has provided to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H I prefer to smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the landlord who lives on income from his property.
It is appropriate to differentiate those who invest in return at the time of their retirement and those who live from their pensions.
A good to rent or two for a couple above, that's wrong.
The small genius of Finance is uniquely lacking imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of lack of large infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
The developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal, so a new deal could be a solution.
Especially in a time when the question of declining arises in response to a recession that is only a brutal declining so brutal
You would have been right 30 years ago: more need (or possibilities) of dams, coal mines, motorways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energetic shock less rough, then the need for investment is crying: isolation, renovation of the rail network, urban transport, transport and energy storage, etc....
Taxation that promotes high incomes and renters.
Who's in power?
Obsessed with smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a galop.
The profits of Samsung are damaged by iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
The mid-September introduction by AppleTM of larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seduced buyers who would otherwise have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided for LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a client, but not for Apple.
I believe it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft introduced this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and they cannot be satisfied by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I appreciate design.
Some people do not attach any value to design, for them the options, functionality and price prime.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let's stop looking for "a better platform".
Is there "a better car manufacturer", not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a flourishing mobile industry with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It is healthier and must be encouraged.
This is of our interest to all.
I'm glad you found exactly what you were looking for and that it's not an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our friends who, according to one of them, fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, well on Parisian bobos ) could tell us about which authors they fight ideas about the genre and tell us the works they just intend to fight.
Or do they just attack the genre described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Their sources are Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, Jean, I love you, and you're someone smart and cultivated.
I said this about Judith in Furusato's vein, mentioning Holopherne, a rapprochement that had not come to me (I have not his spirit vividity).
Otherwise, in the "base", as you send it back, this topic does not interest me, and sincerely I do not see where the problem is: I hope you and your friends could get me out of my back, because I am slow but I understand well...
@ Jean: Recognise that, culturally, send Judith back to Holopherne, that does.
Who's afraid of the world?
But what are we afraid of those who are afraid of?
Furasato and @ give us some answers.
The first by invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second by qualifiing Judith Butler as a very symbolic slice of the throat.
We can see how these studies affect the most intimate homes.
We are obviously no longer in the debate on the idea.
That's another thing, much deeper.
@ Have you read, John, that the World has published an article on the need for theology?
@: With regard to an idea debate, I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
I don't think it's very rigorous to fight ideas from their only presentation (cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of the Genre or X Lacroix, theologian).
But well, as I explained to our floppy friend, it's all the difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion.
I am not sure he's understood the nuance.
I didn't read Judith, the very symbolic slice of the throat, I was happy with the "second sex" (it was more than my time) which I believe is the source of "the source" according to Lo's vows.
While I looked at the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon appeared briefly when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and compensated a bit for the disappointment of having sometimes the view blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, the cloud of last night would really endure the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had a clear time.
Special blood moon flash.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey makes the laboratory responsible.
But if Labour accepts our injustice budget, we will give it its true color as soon as possible.
You're obsessed, aren't you?
I was in Melbourne then naturally I only saw clouds.
Melbourne has also succeeded in covering itself for the whole week of the Perseids weather rain and for virtually all the important astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I begin to think there is a bad genius whose only purpose is to prevent the inhabitants of Melbourne from seeing anything from heaven.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things improve significantly on the other side of the Cordillère.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes when I couldn't see the eclipse due to clouds above Melbourne's suburb.
I'm gonna put a TAX on this eclipse.
Whoever looks at this eclipse should pay a tax.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last before you go to bed.
Who or what will obsess you when he ends (forcefully) by disappearing?
It seems that you spent a lot of time reading the discussions by looking for messages in which people criticize Abbott government and then accuse them of EUX being obsessed.
Beautiful photo of the moon above the Harbour Bridge of Sydney.
Looks like Mars's going to come into collision with the Earth!
Nothing about stock and real estate speculation.
Nothing about inequalities between labour and capital income.
Nothing about tax fraud.
Extreme liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about Babylon's gardens...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
No hyperlink to the original documents so that we can make an opinion.
Go to see today Tuesday 15 October the results of miracle revenues: in Spain, exports have been lowest for five years.
In Greece, the scholarship collapses.
However, these are the examples to follow.
The reform of notaries would generate a claim for compensation of around €8 billion.
The Department of Economics states that these claims for compensation are not justified.
Quiet in case of an error from the Ministry of Economics?
Will the decision-makers who have earned the political benefit from the courageous attack of notaries have the same courage when presenting the bill to the state budget?
The next one in his time.
Okay, thanks, JYL...
@lol No State is not comparable to households with regard to the management of its budget because the state's temporal horizon is theoretically infinite while that of the household is limited by the life of its members.
In addition, unless public expenditure is considered to be inproductive, it contributes to financing material and immaterial investments, which pay for tomorrow's growth and thus future revenues.
Some answers.
A regrettable decision.
But remember Hippocrate's sacred oath: the health of the profits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved above all.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately, the truth does not correspond to your fantasy.
Medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have the hands bound by law as written by policies.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgical interventions, safe shooting rooms for drug addicts rather than having them in the streets, etc.
On these issues, politicians want to enjoy the incult masses.
By the way, doctors don't make money with medicines.
That's why there's pharmacy.
doctors don't make money with drugs Since the Liberals want our health system to look like that of the United States, you should find out how it works.
Everywhere in the world doctors are brokered in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been misformed to put the blame on the drugs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to the benefits of businesses and to "research".
Therefore, read the few reports on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme expenditures and the negotiations with pharmaceutical companies from other countries.
Compare the global prices of medicines everywhere, as well as differences between countries in what is for free sale or only on prescription.
This strengthens it is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, either directly or indirectly.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations against oncological pain, despite the laws that brake them and the required permitted burdens.
Although manufacturers of certain medicines may not be happy to use alternatives such as marijuana, those who arrive at a version offering good quality products at known doses will benefit widely.
Sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're wrong, there's a lot going on in the scenes for doctors and the pharmacy.
With regard to this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone puts the chip in the ear of a manager of this hospital.
We can't detect patents on grass...
If "scientists" in social sciences did research instead of politics and networking, their "works" could be used.
One investigator, he doesn't compare one fact to another.
Comparing it isn't looking.
Comparing it is making pedagogy not research.
It is not possible to say "the research is completed, it must be applied" and then in a single jet "it must be experimented with everything".
If your research is completed, why experiment?
If your research is not completed, why do you ask that they be applied?
Can I be explained how a "searcher" can conclude that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could assimilate mathematics and other materials more easily?
New technologies allow students to learn if they learn to use new technologies, but how would they learn new technologies if they don't know how to learn?
Pisa tests are just an indicator making an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory for us.
What's the point of building an indicator that tells you what's going on, a desire for self-promotion, a deception?
One track to train teachers: away from training, sophists and ideologists and practitioners teach practitioners.
link the paragraph to the internships (which unfortunately is not very argued) and you will see that your conclusion drives us to the most ineffective conservatism: "It is a device that leads primarily to the reproduction of existing practices, and which does not allow the system to progress."
In view of the general consensus on the state of the French system, it cannot be desired that only practitioners teach practitioners, even if they have their full place in modern teacher training.
Education theorists must have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never put his foot in an operating block before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the education system.
Give more weight to the theorists of education, that would destroy it permanently.
Your analogy is totally messy: if I do not want to be operated by a practitioner who has only a theoretical training, I would even less like to be operated by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned about the bag.
Mike Weatherley, the Conservative Member responsible for the fight against the violation of copyright by David Cameron
Why don't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmaiers thank you.
If one day I begin to feel guilty of violating copyright, I will be enough to read an article like this.
In an information economy, the violation of copyright = vol.
This is the same because they must quote their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license costs nothing.
No, it's a violation of copyright.
Not the same thing at all.
By using content without having the appropriate licence, you deprive artists of their toast.
You can always discuss pedal assumptions - but it's stealing.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it won't be true anyway.
It's a violation of copyright.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I begin to feel guilty of violating copyright
Obviously, you don't mind depriving artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school duties, a almost perfect definition of what should be a reasonable use, then I am glad to take them away from this fictive income.
The lesson 1 should be to show how, if children themselves create anything and publish it on their favorite social networks, they abandon any intellectual property to the site under the general conditions that they have passed by a click.
Maybe if they share the listeners of their mp3 walker with a friend in the school bus, they should be expelled to violate the law in this way.
Oh, if we could export that resource we're feeding, the roaster who says everything's going wrong....
If it's a PS member who says it, then we have to believe it.
I have two children and when they are ageing to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then.
France pulls people down by constantly assisting them.
I don't want my children to bear the debt that this policy has created.
What's pulling France down, it's speeches like yours.
@gus I've been working in a private business forever.
I had CHANCE to work in companies led by excellent business leaders: it exists in France, but it's rare.
I'm an employee because I know I don't have the skills to lead a business and this choice allows me to pull red balls on the zero bosses I often meet.
To be comfortable in my basketballs I fully share the post by Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he says the terrible truth!
@gus, if we compare with German companies that French business leaders constantly quote to ask for reforms in France, in Germany companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between large and medium-sized enterprises - what do French bosses expect to do so??
Let the state hold their hands?
That state they're accusing of imperfection?
@ Jacques L.
Always this couplet against business leaders on your part!
Remember, what did you create as a job, as a value added, to be so severe?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In fact, France is faced with an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders who are unable to create jobs and who are briberying and mining waiting for the state's permanent assistant!
That's awful!
But they have solutions: removal of the Labour Code, employers' charges, taxes, work 45h/week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, oaths to claim lower wages if they are not abolished!
I look forward to seeing all the "negative" comments on this subject.
What is ironic is the way people always complain about First Group.
According to what I see from where I am, Last has not really been an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to stay floating rather than transforming themselves.
This doesn't mean that the Scottish railways have not improved since Last took care of it.
But they also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do this.
I tried to have them recently, but I didn't succeed.
But well, Labour will get us bored, isn't it...
It's an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
Nothing prevents people in the United Kingdom from creating a more moral company and participating in tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good in management, most of our private services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I remember the scandal and criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all of this so that the decision was finally cancelled.
And it's better: MTR, a Hong Kong company has won the Crossrail operating contract for 8 years.
Well, Labour, as they have repeated to us during the referendum campaign, is entirely for sharing and sharing and believes that workers must all help themselves across borders.
It can therefore be assumed that they will be happy with this decision ;)
It may be because the management of the Dutch is on good track while the management of the British is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of owner but above all new ideas.
Abellio may be the worst choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchiser.
"It was a cheating girl."
God, I hate, but I really hate that kind of expression.
Assuming that being "slaughter" is a quality superior to many others, the concern of others, intelligence, listening, for example, has nothing to do with being "slaughter" to survive a disease: cancers "slaughter", which are not less dead, I know palanques.
Out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Let's start again, too.
I'm not telling you that this is the condition to manage, I'm telling you that help..
Nothing has to do with any merit...!
When in the examples of your life, there is only you to judge them.
I'll start again.
Insinuating, would it be just a moment, that one can have merit to get out of a disease or that one can deteriorate from not getting out of it, is simply a monster.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that drops, from everywhere, despite the will, despite the confidence in medicine, do you have a vague idea of what C?
I'm sorry to think the opposite, if, having a solid morality probably makes it easier to accept and prepare heavy treatments, to try experimental treatments as this woman did, and not to refuse them by fear.
Somebody who fights in medicine is first of all someone who trusts medicine.
But if we prefer to go back to the Lord, that's something else.
Neither with merit, nor with courage.
These considerations are specific to moralists.
When you catch a dirt, a real one, you're getting rid of yourself so much as to become just a zombie.
Personally, I caught two of them, dirt, big, and if I'm "kicked" like these psychologists say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight consists only of crushing teeth, suffering hell and crushing shots.
I thought the charge against Milosevic had been decided and finalized ten years ago.
I haven't seen that name in the newspapers since at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted "swiftly" and then swept under the carpet.
Is that the story we told then?
The Communist became a nationalist who has triggered three wars in the Balkans over the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask what we volunteerly left behind: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under the MOINDRE rule of international law?
Which country has Serbia attacked?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way to get out of it: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended him, he would be swallowed by the Western compressor.
The West used a smoke screen to unlock a part of a sovereign State that then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was almost recognized by the Western States who then lied from end to end on the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now disappeared completely (ethnic purification).
Vojislav Kostunica, which is mentioned here, died politically after his first mandate for not understanding the situation that had evolved.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
In the end, the Guardian should not call Milosevic a tyran (even if we did not like him).
As I know, only in Greece is a method of predicting earthquakes running around, measuring the piezoelectric level in the quartz.
Such studies are undoubtedly useful and thank you for sharing the results.
A hope so but caution is to put This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet called HAT-P-11b, located at about 124 years of Earth light in the Cygnus constellation which would be "the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules" , according to a study conducted by Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine of the University of Maryland.
Method to be followed.
Just like those that involve animals that feel a threat coming.
Thank you Scientists for enjoying us, often, of these experimental provocations that are carried out in the world.
How would animals know (In advance)?
Probably due to the perception of other elements whose rate is changing in the event of earthquake.
Like radon, for example.
An a priori inodore gas for man but may be detectable by animals.
All these methods are indetectable for man, but not for the measuring instruments available to him.
But we do not have reliable results on these tracks...
It has been repeatedly observed (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely for a few hours with a earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs, but above all fish and snakes.
I had seen an art report telling about the fight of two scientific teams, one Californian and the other Japanese, to recognize the validity of their work on animal sensitivity to terrestrial magnetic fields, and especially their change before a seism.
So of course I'm not a scientist, but their assumptions convinced me!
Or are we on these research?
Why so much disrespect for this track?
We should learn again to listen to nature...
If you look at things calmly and thoroughly, you publish it in a serious magazine, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the "signs" given by the animals, we encounter the same intersection: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before a earthquake the red fish was rotating strangely around.
I do not understand that we can think that Boris would be a good leader for the Conservatives.
He has done too much as a mayor of London.
When you listen to LBC's program, you can't stop thinking that this man doesn't know anything about it and that he's always trying to distract with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked him about what.
He couldn't appoint a single point.
He made so many promises to be elected as a mayor, and he did not hold one.
It just highlights how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a bullshit, isn't it?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in " Have I Got News for You".
Because it's a celebrity and we have instructed people to worship celebrities.
The Londoners voted for him and will be the same for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the leadership of the party, the popularity rating of the Tories will kill the ceiling I am sure.
May God help us.
I'm not so sure: people love jokes, but don't want their Prime Minister to be one of them.
That's exactly what we said about Londoners.
He should have brought his friend with him the parpaing, smarter than he.
In many respects, I think he's trying to copy R Branson
The Americans had one as President.
The French have really and always been unselfish of the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have given themselves the tribute to read a few books (there are some, including a French and excellent from B.
Millot), the "Samon" and the "stroke of iron" speak, as sadly as the dead who remained there.
It is understood that Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, Australia, must always be there in the bottom since the battle of Savo) do not want to return.
We were actually past the island of Savo, in the "Iron Bottom Sound".
Even if the mission reaches its end.
They're the little ones.
But the ecological side is a total incense.
Calculate the kerozene consumes to achieve the goal decreditable completely the concept..
Just browse the list of sponsors Only philanthropes.
One more com operation, neither did nor did.
The cow, it makes too much desire!!!
I look forward to the web series with impatience!
Your recit returns to me, by identifying myself a little bit at the passage (I also learned to navigate with the Crocos de L'Elorn at the Moulin Blanc in the blade of Brest!).
Hat also for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of the move.
The end justifies the means.
Keep making us back, and show with pride that the Breton are great travelers!
Pierre, Trinidad and Tobago.
Good evening I think the red hat that manifested against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Brittany Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously, I think that local authorities and public bodies of any kind should not devote a sum of our taxes to financing the dreams of some adventurers even as friendly as those!
Are there players in the current Serbian training that are from Kosovo?
I know Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, once at Juventus and now at Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they're still in the team.
This is Bisevac, Lyon's defender, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was in the middle or before in the 70s and 80s and trained many teams in Greece, but I don't know where it is.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and has played as an attacker in Velez's great team, who, under the supervision of legendary Suleman Rebac, has finished twice second in the Yugoslav League (and also had points like Vahid Halilhodzic and the faithful team of Arsène Wenger, Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you, Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just for curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
They said he was going to become a great player when he was in Jude, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was tied to Blackburn *frisson*
Here, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to the Fener and as far as I know he's not holding it.
Maybe he can do something else, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania is not afraid.
You should love Albania because you're neighbors.
The thing is that the flag of this drone is not the flag of the real Albania today.
Apparently it was the flag of Great Albania, which covers all regions where there is a significant Albanian presence.
A bit of excessive nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there has not been too much damage (that I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what was called Great Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the major European powers decided to give the country ends to neighbouring countries.
How can you feel "a joy-explosion" by seeing two towers collapse knowing that women, men and children are inside?
How???
What bothers me a little in this "breathing" is that the only thing that could have been able, once again, to rejoice spontaneously in the terrible death of thousands of people, in my view, is a "border line" personality whose all "breaks" should be taken with the greatest circumspection.
Probably at the short time of "joying" we would not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror imposed.
We just thought, for a moment, that for once Muslims had succeeded in really and apocalypticly hurting the great wicked Satan in his own heart.
Making qqch powerful.
It's great.
It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims who have been snuggled by their feeling of humiliation.
With testimonies filmed in Palestine.
Classical injuriousness.
We had a bit of a doubt.
The Western "Christian/Blanch/Gaulic" cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the musuman when it looks at generic poverty, social and cultural underdevelopment of today's Muslim Arab world.
I'm talking about Cairo's faubourgs or Algiers, not Dubai's towers.
The past splendour, certainly magnified is not a comfort, on the contrary.
How can I get the Muslim world out of this devil?
Totally in phase, 2 major poisons irrigate the Arab world l: conservatism bigot of power in place and fascinating nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the (douce or armed) excommunication of its critical expression.
That we understood before, shouldn't make the Muslims move back.
It's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I suppose that is true in many countries.
But in Britain, the autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, wet and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
In addition, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm suffering myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for the mood and well-being.
The autumn is beautiful in Great Britain, with or without rain.
In particular, the campaign will be shortened in autumn.
Not as much to cut the breath as the green of the summer when everything is alive instead of being about to die.
In Britain, if you're lucky, the summer falls a weekend.
We've had a beautiful summer this year, don't make your shiny sparkling clichés!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in winter.
But now I'm retired and I no longer develop immunity to outside germs, it can change, I guess.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful step full of drunken smells, with a fever that climbs with festivities like Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of snow and full of other wonderful words.
Just don't stop doing things!
Here are my recommendations for the parties for you.
Yes, these dark and grey months actually make me much more happy and more relaxed.
For the taxation of child supplements , it is the amount cashed by the State that comes mainly from deciles 8 to 10 .
But with regard to the number of households having seen their tax increase as a result of this measure , it is mainly deciles 4 and 5 that are concerned ( median income ) according to graph 2 .
The elimination of half the part of the widows, especially, is not covered by the article at all or rather its impact is completely underestimated: EUR 230m is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and underscores its indolence.
And it's not ready to work out.
Well, we're not on the straw though, but thinkers
For once the PS is making a rather left-handed policy we won't cry...
It is obvious that those who are among the richest 20% must bear much more than 75% of the increase in taxes, why not 90%?
Let's continue this way and you will encourage these 20% to work or leave.
Well, I know, it's not politically correct, but I still say it.
Live the Trots and OCIs recycled at PS: they have understood everything.
Adam, you don't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is still the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population has 80% of wealth.
An equitable tax is when it prohibits anyone from raising as much as it can.
Beyond a certain limit, money loses all its utility.
And once the use of money has been exceeded, money is used only to make money, that is, to do the unfortunateness of the greatest number.
We're one of the richest 20%.
Probably also the 20% of homes that work most (and create wealth, a part of which is logically redistributed).
Fair taxation should allow these homes to benefit from some of their efforts.
Or even then lower your arms and live social minima, especially if you have social housing.
The utopia of the red Khmer headshakers have, fortunately, lived.
I recently made two AirBnBs in Norway.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things that we wouldn't have had in a 5-star hotel and we didn't have to present ourselves at the reception or face the least tracas.
Just go to someone's house, sleep there, put behind you and go back.
From now on it will be my first option when I'm on my trip.
The logo has changed, people ...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases you will need a kind of owner insurance.
Make sure to use a service with the right logo!
Ah, six o'clock too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and highly risky" No, it's not true.
You just really missed luck.
According to the link provided in the article:
Airbnb's response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, according to an e-mail provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locker to change locks, made arrangements to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
Then why does Teman quote that article that he has not received any support from Airbnb?
I ADD AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hello I'm looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I'm planning to pay a pre-payment and a month's rent at a time but I'm a little afraid to send $1,600 to a site that I've never really heard.
But where are we going?
"Supporting the troops," the Bu$herie sang on all tones...
Arms are harmless.
I am sure it will be a pleasure for families and close to thousands of dead Kurds in Halabja to learn that their parents and friends have succumbed to something other than the chemical bombings of Saddam Hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain polite).
In addition, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons discovered nearly 20 years later were still usable?
It is not very clear the author's style: "to seek weapons of mass destruction.
We're all right.
You think this is the time to weaken the army to strengthen education
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still in war.
Alternative: Is this the time to strengthen education, because we are still in war?
There would already be much strengthening of education if they were "worked" for 35 hours instead of 17.
At the time, our teachers are currently winning more than engineers.
And we don't think teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their program.
But this is not true because the National Education does not have the means to provide a college/lycée office to its teachers so they work at home.
A kind of forced telework in total, except that the employer does not pay the computer, the Internet connection or supplies.
By the way, it's so much the hiding at 5:00 a week and 4 months of vacation that we can't fill the CAPES with math, come, we're waiting for you.
What do you mean you don't want to grab some poorly educated punks whose parents are crawling on you by treating you as a punk?
I believe that the priority in this area is to disarm the jihads so that the khurd population can grow better.
Where we see that Bush administration has absolutely done everything.
My first graduate job was in the sale, in London, to win three times nothing, and yet it was a job for which a degree was required.
A year later, I saw an announcement to be a worker for the London Metro, it was paid £5,000 more a year and we didn't even ask for the patent.
I've never regretted.
Don't worry about this if you don't find a graduate job, try to find something that pays well, or you like to do.
If I had stayed at graduate jobs, I'd still have to pay my student loan.
I don't like business work so much, so I hope in the long run either in the public service or in the university world.
LOL LOL LOL This article comes really late!
Exactly, when I obtained my degree in 2011 there was already a three-year backlog.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
To get rid of the bikini lines like art / letters / theatre / media / philosophy / political sciences, that is, what is called the degrees of unemployed.
I've got one of these degrees and I've finished production director.
It turned out that the important thing was not the diploma, but, as the article above says, a good professional course, starting at school and throughout the university.
While the starting salary was lower, the levels are quickly raised because in the real world what matters is the results more than knowledge.
This debate has lasted for years.
Scientists can't solve all problems, it's more important to be able to get up in the morning, arrive at work at the time and interact with people in order to achieve results.
Letters, philosophy, and art are bionic lines?
That's ridiculous.
I suppose you're talking about the degrees of media study or whatever the abscond line you went to.
Letters, philosophy, political sciences and art are real lines.
We need people who can explain the great questions to high school students, who understand the importance of cultural foundations such as literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
Wouldn't it be better if it were a real territorial policy to dismantle Paris and dynamise the rest of France?
Personally, I do not see the people in the end of Essonne and Val-d'Oise doing 80km back every day on the bike to come to work in Paris.
Intra-muros and small belt residents already have many common transport modes otherwise more convenient (metro, bus, tramway).
> Several secured and closed key parks, as already exists in northern European cities, in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
Good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by the 2RM.
At the same time, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
Both benefit from their great experience in the field.
Well, we didn't find room for ONE ONE bicycle hanging device.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Well, it's not right at all.
When we discuss with pedestrians and other users of common transport the reasons why they don't pedal, it seems to me that the main reasons that arise are: 1/ it is hyper dangerous with all these trucks, these trucks, these scooters who are rolling super fast and don't care about the survival of bicycles 2/ one takes full of pollution in the head For me the bike tracks are piss to go, it is necessary to reduce motor traffic (urban road type congestion load), reduce speed (Paris = zone 30), make compliance with the road code by systematically verbalizing (even the bikes to bemol pre-written to adapt the road code for cars 100 years ago to bicycles), generalize the tampons after closed passages, not before sinon bags and scooters don't genete.
Cycling tracks are apartheid, one must co-habit but rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in the Great Paris?
Not a word on the bike place in public transport?
EELV is right.
The goal of 15% velo deplacements is ridiculous.
I'm beginning to believe Anne Hidalgo has rolled the greens in the flour.
In addition, following OR reports, the EELV assistants seem skeptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, it's better to find who's really hiding behind this massacre.
Index: it's not Russia.
Not sure to love how the world evolves.
That sounds awful.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I did not hear that a complaint was actually filed.
In addition, they should first file a complaint in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be postponed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the resulting criminal investigation.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong; the fault is the airspace security authority, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had been killed before, Ukraine was launching air attacks against the rebels, and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in view of a clear threat or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocents so that airlines pay the rights to fly over the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls defending their usurpating government / the ultranationalists of Western Ukraine - and who want to show in large that Putin killed the MH17 flight.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what is happening in their heavens.
The previous: a 1986 judgment of the International Court of Justice concluded that the CIA's supply of weapons to the opposing forces of the Contras in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia will not let this case go to the CIJ.
It's funny to think Abbott means to Putin that Australians have been murdered by rebels supported by Russia.
I hope he can provide evidence to support his allegations.
So far, the investigators have not said anything like that.
Call yourself Ricardo and be such an ecobain, that's awesome!
Calling Polaire is losing the north is joyful.
One question about Beotien: is the poor one today poorer than the poor one yesterday?
I can't take notice that those who criticize the book of Pikety most vigorously did not read it!
It's easy to read, I spent a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, capital-income, inequalities-concentration, inequalities in labour income, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the logic.
It shows that the concentration of today's capital joins that of the beginning of 20° before 1914, it shows that it is the 2 world wars that have reduced the concentration of capital from 1914 to 1945, then how the concentration resumed after...
Bernajuzan: you don't know what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this pavement knowing that the ability to concentrate an individual has a few limits.
Then the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is right or not.
If it is fair, it can be debated without reading the book, the most important of which is to argue in a unique sense in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long have you spent to read it?
Is the central thesis of his paper summarised by the press false?
I haven't read it, and I won't read it.
I therefore rely on the summary of his central thesis and that is the one that seems to me purely smoked.
The concept of a gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Has humanity not become globally enriched?
And this enrichment added to an increase in the population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and certainly deserves the price.
But remember, she's only 17 years old.
An age when most people just start to find their place in the world.
I hope that this prize will not be a burden for the girl and that she will find her way to lead a happy life.
The problem is not the price, but the political capital of the Western governments that want to prove the old saying that colored perverts are the incarnation of evil.
All my wishes of happiness in Malala, but she must realize that it is used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - even in the popular neighborhoods of Great Britain!
Did someone think his speech was a little strange.
She thanked her father for giving her much freedom, but she mentioned that if she wasn't where she is now, she would have been married at 14 years of age.
Isn't Malala itself part of these "coloured perverts"?
You should not have any "antenne time" on this site.
You are yourself a terrible pervert.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, his father wasn't going to marry her at the age of 14.
She was 15 when she was shot.
His father runs a school where girls are being educated and he is in favour of equal rights for women.
He is, and has always been, to receive higher education and to have the right to decide on her own marriage.
However, he is an unusual person in Pakistan, as he thinks women are equal to men.
What she said is that a average Pakistani girl must often marry at 14 years of age, without having her word to say.
I'm sorry she didn't say that in a way that was enough for you.
This may seem contradictory, but maybe she means, if her father hadn't given her freedom, she would have been married at 14 years of age.
Rather disappointed by this entry in season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange, who apparently has a little difficulty finding her societal character of Marlene Dietrich.
I just watched the last two seasons that are quite different, but I have to admit that it is one of the best series of horror, one of the most complete!
A fascinating first episode.
The achievement is close to perfection and the show of Jessica Lange singing the anachronic Life on Mars of Bowie is simply reversing.
I haven't looked at this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story, I prefer to look at 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is clear, besides Jessica Lange's extraordinary, it's especially the risks of scenes and assemblies that lie with me.
We have in AHS a avalanche of original plans that makes the asepticization of today's productions quite ridiculous.
I can't even see you throw the sponge in advance for the next seasons without even waiting for the quality of it.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series, but, you say so well, there are many other things.
No, it's just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and how she uses it) is really one of the pillars of the series outside technical qualities.
And good bah I look a lot for her.
Then I find that the series of sins by writing, she wants to do too many things at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in the 2 it was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them do 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it's gonna end like 24 hours of time what.
But good everyone does what he wants!
It is by what I say "I will no longer look" that everyone is obliged to do the same!
I simply share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
Jessica Lange's loss, I think she will be fatal to her.
But then, that's just my opinion.
Let's talk less about tax increases, please - let's rather cut in government spending.
No, let's increase expenditure, please.
Those who wanted to scratch in expenditure failed.
Initiate polemics about relatively low expenditure items, such as development assistance
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the United Kingdom.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than about the change of orientation that the voters seem to call from their wishes and during all this time some, in each camp, pretend that these nuances are much more important and substantial than they are - and the voters see clearly in their game and find them of bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenditure.
"Debt" is assets primarily held by financial institutions in the country.
"Debt" is nothing to worry about.
I would see no problem that the government would own a third of my income (before even talking about consumer taxes) if I thought it would be used to use it properly.
But that is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been quite honest about how to reduce taxes but good, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, the almost unnecessary wind power subsidies and nuclear power plants that cost twice as much as they should, you arrive at a figure that makes the Labour and Lib-Dem tax on the most luxurious residences seem ridiculous.
Your first £10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns £ 35,000 a year will pay about £ 5 000 (a seventh of their salary), someone with £ 50,000 would pay about £ 10,000 (a fifth), etc. and someone with £ 200,000 will pay about £ 70,000 (a little more than a third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking costs and the car vignette, and this is before VAT.
Almost 30% of my money is taken from the source before local taxes and the car vignette.
I'm paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it's a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But don't pretend to believe that money falls from heaven, or that it's not important to know where billions of pounds of taxes go.
How can a unemployed person who is looking for work at the door-to-door can prove that?
Nevertheless, 20% of the unemployed would not look, that means that 80% are looking for and not finding.
As I am a unemployed person, am I more interested in what others are looking for or not?
That a potential recruiter receives 10 or 20 CVs, that increases my chances as much.
In fact, I haven't had news from Pôle Employment for months, that means that the officers are more busy with checking operations than actually getting job ads back?
I don't see the interest.
Because it's not up to the state to provide work.
If Pole Employment does not provide enough jobs, then we have to go from Pole Employment.
What is this a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in this case we ensure that the unemployed fulfil their duties in return for their rights.
Just as a controller asks users for their licence of transport of a means of transport, a head of service or employees of their work, etc.
Nobody's screaming at the scandal in these cases, isn't it?
It is indeed good to recall that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I had to deal with Pole Employment, my rights to the ARE had been wrongly established, and on one of the files, 40 per cent shot, it had to be fought firmly.
It takes some time!
I'm not an expert in law.
Fiscalization and control are now taking over, while Pôle Emploi is in fact close to being an insurance company.
I would add that the issue of compensation should only concern employees, they are the ones who pay for the sideways.
Politicians and non-wage French grant themselves rights that they do not actually have!
It's not normal.
I would add that a worthy unemployment insurance is involved in the value of labour.
More than waiting for twitter killers in Arabic...
In fact, there must be a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then look like the spread of black pest in 1348/9 in connection with war and population movements at the time.
The Saudis had the spirit of banning this year the Hadj to the Mecca to Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have seen their visa application refused due to their country of origin or recent travel.
In fact, there was a pilgrim coming from Bosnia that contracted the Variole to Mecca during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim coming from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same spirit presence.
Is it heartless to propose to prevent Ebola's sick people from taking a plane for Europe?
I thought it was just good sense, but apparently those who "know" decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
These countries in West Africa where Ebola is out of control should be placed in strict quarantine.
No one's out.
Only health staff can enter.
21 days of waiting after treatment of patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they are there, they stay there until they are healed.
These are not drastic measures.
Only last week, people were contaminated after having had contacts with people in West Africa, although they have taken "all necessary precautions".
We can stop the progress of this disease.
It spreads mainly through airlines.
Let us prohibit them from offering flights to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical symptoms of Ebola, so that they can be placed immediately in quarantine.
That he can pass the message of the first individual and the second group (including religious) and he will have earned the Nobel of peace.
I doubt that he is capable of building in dogma the image of God characterized by the total of the planet's cortex in operation.
He is still far from this concept here.
It's only been 20 years that the information has emerged as the prime given to humanity, while religion, from the cervelet, has led our actions since Lucy perhaps.
What is the interest of becoming a first Protestant Church?
For those who have not noticed it, Catholicism is largely minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not put their feet in the Church anyway, there is only a small number of protestants in France.
What is the next step, we remove the concept of sin, too "anxiogenic"?
@louise: Sorry the church does not have a limited vision to France.
And in the world, it may be possible to touch more people...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) with respect for others as you consider it to exist to the Christian.
Hillel, a century before he said, "Don't do to others what you don't want to do, it's all the Torah and the rest is just a comment: go and study!".
Christianity goes well beyond reciprocity but introduces agape.
Your "promoting justice, peace, fraternity" but without God?
It's a return to communism? :-)
Next step: the incarnation and resurrection are removed.
Jesus will remain this hero who has altered moral laws by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be ready to assume their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace, brotherhood.
Not very Catholic?
I think that the low number of protestants in France is mainly due to the fact that their ancestors were destroyed and converted to force and pushed to immigration a few centuries ago.
I doubt too much between buying this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new game Elite will be out soon.
It doesn't invent.
I personally would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in his fundraising campaign) but I don't think it's £30.
If you are interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
I'll look.
Of course not at work.
The rabat-joie of the IT department blocks all the nice websites.
Hello, is it £30 then 20% discount, or are the £30 included 20% discount?
Attention, however, the PC version is only for DX11.
It surprised me, I bought it, but I can't play it.
In addition, I bought it at Steam, so no refund, it's none.
It's time to buy a new video card.
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all this: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon £ 30 for PC, £ 35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, £ 44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid that one day they'll get it out of your library if they decide to sew it against people who buy it there while they're out of the planned area.
Join the beta version of Elite: Dangerous.
So was the 1940 France a "petride" land?
So tell me, this Nobel prize looks like a poisoned gift.
You need to love France of 40, that of "the strange defeated"?
When you see who gets the Nobel of literature, you wonder if Proust or Dostoïevsky would have it today.
Nobel is not even an event, we don't even want to read the primitive authors.
Are Brazilians, Chinese or Australians going to read Modiano, which is already hardly readable in French and which describes a world so limited and so self-centered?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible, but honestly I doubt that.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a far-reaching relationship with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel price?
It would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, Brazilians and others, don't worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They will appreciate Mr.
Modiano at its fair value, if they don't already know it!
On your side, continue to meet Lévy and Musso.
I share your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso retain all their chances.
Then let's see who got the Nobel of Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hi, the horrors.
Since I drove one to Iceland, I've been seeing Kia Sports everywhere.
I think this thing followed me up here.
Maybe she wants to crash me?
Or swallow me like Superman III's terrible computer?
Hello Dantra, still hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my meds.
It's Wednesday!
I've had a few days of rest.
It was cool.
Last weekend, I went to the Nottingham beer and cider party.
That's a mess.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were not only CAMRA fanatics (to not confuse with the camera fanatics).
It was really hard to drive on Sunday's return.
On Monday night, we went to a friend's grandfather's home to play the nine brag card.
Thanks to a real chance of beginner I could go back with several decent bets.
I hope if I get 95, I'll be as alive as he is.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks arrived with a slice of lobster on it.
I admire M.
Read a little Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
In other words, without wanting to upset you, I think you're getting a little away from the subject.
This famous whole, it bans quests for the jihadists at the exit of the mosques.
She signals the arms traffic without delay.
We either have big eyes open like Meddeb and Taiwan or Boubaker or we have big eyes closed.
You have to choose.
It is not by keeping the eyes closed that we access light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again, you are making a monumental counter-sense: all the representative authorities, organizations or associations, whether Muslim or not, who have formally condemned the EIA and its crimes, French, Muslim or not, have nothing to add to these unanimity official convictions.
Who doesn't say consent.
The problem is that people like you first see them as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, doubt exists for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by the French Jews of Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them of it in advance and to demand that they manifest publicly to prove to the rest of the French society that it is wrong to doubt it.
This principle, in my view, is the denial of the Republic and can only help to offend French society.
If there is no doubt, so say it.
Who does not say consent, but consents to what?
Consent to a proximity to EI or to the conviction of EI.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to house the goat and the choir.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmaticly insupportable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could "revenge" the parties represented in Westminster during the elections because a huge gap between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised on the eve of the referendum on independence.
Cameron has to be penetrated to the idea of losing all those seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives totally care about Scotland because they don't have a seat there.
They can do what they want in absolute impunity.
I don't think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that the Labour losing seats in Westminster for the SNP is a good long-term thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who's gonna throw a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be completely eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who will cut their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "Promessus" thinking he was saving his party, but he did not realize he signed the death sentence of his Scottish members.
It is not surprising that some Labour Members ask for account from their directors.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in Parliament, even if the seats are not from the Conservatives, they will then be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they can force both the Conservatives and Labour to do what they have promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that is more important than that.
Not if Labour or the Conservatives want to be re-elected in England one day.
Cirating the 85% pumps at the expense of 85% is not a great election strategy.
In addition, once the Scottish MEPs are no longer able to vote on matters concerning England, the Conservatives will win all votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with Ulster's unionists, and she did it well.
However, he has still been in the lice to be Prime Minister in 2015 and this since he has won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So, in general, these boxes will virtually be behind each reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It is "The Life of the Others" of East Germany or the KGB applied to the FRIC world...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
In the end, this will have at least a sterile effect.
I'm waiting for the next ticket: Amazon manufactures your book according to your profile and this automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!
It's like a world.
Strongly stimulating.
Thank you for the article.
As under this system, DRM management is not implemented, I still have to read hacked files, public domain books or purchased from some publishers who have the intelligence of proposing files without a loop.
Given the price I paid the Kobo, it's without regret.
I am dreaded about the generalized abolition of users in the face of the general ownership of their privacy.
At your public library you will systematically notice that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also demanding masterpieces whose opening and completion rates are likely to be disturbing.
For example » Finnegans Wake » by James Joyce.
@Thomas: In the Big Data Age, the data does not really need to be personal to be relevant.
Be careful not to put all the literature in the same box.
The collection of anonymous data when there is a profile....
The harvest is not anonymous.
It is the data published by Kobo that do not allow or identify readers or authors.
But Kobo has all that information, he.
There have been so many excessive, erroneous and contradictory statements by the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be led by a mother class full of acidic schizophrenic children.
It's even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism.
Interestingly, some supporters of Erdogan think that Islamist is such an insult that they delete your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well seen:-P But Turkey does not want to shoot himself in the foot, unless it wins anything.
If she attackes ISIS, ISIS will retreat, so it's actually a bullet in the foot.
A retired diplomat writes on his blog: "The PA reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be a mistake to attempt to overthrow the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad because that would put Israel at risk.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran sent a serious warning of reprisals or if Iran simply advised caution.
This second option is more likely and, in any case, what really surprises is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic commitment concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region."
The reading of Indian Punchline is highly recommended to anyone who is paying attention to the details rather than to the brains balanced by traditional media. The short article you give the link is important and should be read in mind the realistic/precedent warnings from Iran to propose Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980.
Who are these "moderate" who seriously fight the terrible Latin Assad and at the same time the perverts of ISIS?
Pipelines' policy drives the world to the abyss, and I would suggest to those who refer to "moderate" in existence to pay more attention to the facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in the Third World War.
"It's even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism" Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I've got one in mind.
There would be a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Do you have to "require"?
Do you realize that neither criminals nor victims have any chance of still being alive?
A little late for that, buddy...
Wouldn't criminals be barely old now, like 120 years old?
It's a little late for that, isn't it?
Especially concerning the CUP triumvirat that planned and directed genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after the First World War by revenge by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a place burned in Central Asia at about the same time, when he went there by dreaming of establishing a Turkish empire there.
That's crazy!
An impressive control of the sophism of the fatal slope, but apart from this, we seek in vain contact with the real one.
Just clichés without argumentation.
The foetus will always hear a heart that even beats in the belly of a bearer mother.
Lesbian couples may simply be a desire for a child and not a desire to be accepted.
The sterile hetero couples too.
The children!
What a shame to call them future psychologically unbalanced.
One day, they will have the age of defending themselves, saying that they are happy to live, to earn their lives and to pay the retirement of this lady (?)
The GPA is probably a provisional "solution" in the evolution of medicine that our world knows.
It's not from today.
Many women brought and brought children who were not their husbands.
This is still the case, so we are done...
The important thing in this area is that this practice is framed so that the "marchandization" of the body is limited.
But aesthetic surgery, cosmetics aren't they as commercializing the bodies? !
Anacronic Fare Unit ...
It is certainly more elegant to make a good grow in a distant country via the Internet and Pay Pal than to enclose its responsibilities and to avoid the scandal in another century near home without shouting it at that time on all the roofs! ...
These practices were no longer done in the name of the church! ...
There are not only Christians and believers who refuse these practices ...
Still, the exploitation of the bodies is a real problem.
Oh shut up, this man is passionate about something.
At the end of the 1970s in the Midlands, I only saw this far away.
I had to go in the day because I had no right to go in the night!
But if you like this and you listen to music - this music today it always touches you as much.
I don't know why there are so many disgusting comments here about what Paul Mason says, maybe they're posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I think in the sports section there is an article on football that awaits your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's film, there has been a shortage of reports that really reflect the reality of Northern England's culture.
Nothing surprising about Paul Mason's understanding of the social and political context, he understands things well.
The Northern soul is still alive, but it has been vampirated by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
In other words, if you are in the London region in November, 99psoul will again pass soul vinyls, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday November 15 at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I thought "ever the same story," too, but here's a small, well-written article.
Your criticisms really need to be more constructive.
Great article.
I loved your documentary.
I guess you're happy to have escaped at Newsnight.
Last train for Wigan from Victoria/Exchange and down to Wallgate.
By putting pills.
Whatever the station before Wigan was Ince, 15 minutes walk from Wigan after buying a ticket for the arrest after Victoria!
The beginnings of the Northern soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the police series George Gently, Gently Northern Soul, which took place in Newcastle in 1968.
Business is becoming increasingly poisoning.
The Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahou never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahou is not looking for peace because he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (and that was also the case with Rabin).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahou and their electors all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He took away his clothes, put them on the rock, and entered into the water.
A Israeli had stolen them from him.
The Israeli representative was angry and said, "What are you talking about?
The Israelites weren't even there at the time!"
The Palestinian representative (UN) said and added: and now things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian Authority and will not reduce custody ...
That this displeases the anti-Israelians is a clear thing, it is not the goal sought ...
Antisionist: But I answered you, I translate: the global geopolitical report ...
And this has always been the case since politics has been globalized ...
Avoidance, Avoidance...
In the Israeli-colonial conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain that it will continue!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What force ratio has allowed the creation of Israel?
Antisionist: Israel-Palestinian conflict is still a report of force!
Do you doubt it?!!! ...
In addition, it's not just about Russell Brand, but the Guardian journalists seem to have difficulty going beyond anything he doesn't have to say.
Many of what he says are only pseudo-chomskyst balls written not others.
This proves that you don't understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a suite of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes her, which would mean it's a matter of immortality).
A really vicious burden, with just a suspicion of consciousness that Russell Brand says certain truths, maybe truths that you prefer not to think about.
Hold on, this feeling will become more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand horripile some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the absurdities of the tabloids he actually gives the impression of being a beginner populist, but all this story of not voting has been completely misinterpreted by me.
The general consensus seems to be that it just tells people not to vote and rather to cross the arms and ignore the entire political process - but if you look at the interview of Paxman and other articles/videos he posted, he says that voting once every five years only for Labour or Conservatives (or the Lib Dems I suppose) and limiting democratic commitment to this is completely unnecessary, the two parties (at slightly different levels) ruling primarily for particular interests, multinational companies and rich people, at no time he simply says to ignore politics because these parties do not govern on our behalf: he insists on saying that rather than just vote and disconnection for five years, people should become much more politically active at the local level, organize movements, demonstrations, petitions, and try to influence politics from this point of view.
I do not say that I am necessarily in agreement with his solution (because I think that being active politically by presenting his requests can go hand in hand with the fact that the politicians are wits that will change their minds if they really risk losing the elections), but it is annoying to see all those condescending answers that say that this fool who makes Jesus tells young people not to take the time to vote and just hope that everything will be better because it really deforms his arguments.
Its solution is extremely controversial and it would be good if people debated what he actually says rather than simply labeling it as irresponsible and putting away the concerns of him and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The thing about the vote was completely deformed.
The uselessness of slipping a bulletin into an urn every five years makes me deeply angry because my vote really doesn't matter for nothing.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and Members who report locally to their voters.
In addition, I contest the idea that Russell Brand's words are not his own (written by others).
He is intelligent enough to have his own words and ideas, even though they are strongly influenced by the kind of thinkers and university anti-establishment from the counter-culture that Suzanne would like to group under the label "Psychic-chomskyst ballows".
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne does like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the headlifts added to the assembly!
Like Max Keiser, who at first attacked Russell but finally became one of his fans and invited him to his show, it's too easy to attack her without really understand what he wants to do.
It is a political speech that has existed for generations, but which has been marginalized by traditional media - including the Guardian - for generations.
In my view, this "spoke" mainly reveals that the intellectual debate has not been held for a long time at the RDVs of History, where professional historians have become a minority and where the exchange of specialists has hampered to benefit from condensed loan-to-think type Science Po for press files.
For my part, I had seen in Pierre Bourdieu's intellectual attitude as well as Michel Foucault's attitude, a need to deal with a guilty, a messenger.
They develop one of the very rational reasonings, but this rationality is based on these emanating bows that are the key to their thought.
I rather believe that for Foucault the state was essential as a guilt.
This is part of a very archaic thought, the sacrificial thought, which is also magical thought.
The problem of the report to the other is solved by eliminating it.
There is an anarchistic, neo-lib and / or /libertarian slope (of the two terms the second marks a tightening of the desire to eradicate the state, the first knowing to seek the state help for its markets) in the sense of at least state / not at all state at Foucault.
The old dream of the base that organizes itself beautifully.
His thought is built on the guilt of the state: without that guilt it does not stand.
Who says guilty, so called elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position against the three intellectuals quoted here.
Nor a support on the other hand.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old time, that of his god of then, Staline, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you probably read a chouya too fast if you took Foucault's texts on the Iranian revolution for an apology of Khomeiny.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer enjoy attacking Michel through this...
Gauchet has a deep reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty of the mechanism of accession in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree with him or not, he's an original and respectable thinker.
Seeing this cabal orchestrated by hard-left human sciences researchers who do not support the passage of lightness to their mantras is quite risky.
Narcissism and authoritarianism of these people are unlimited.
An important point to add seems to me to be the position of these "reverbs", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of Chinese and other "yellows" I have witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the pleasure to hear our Australian friends about this, then.
And where was it in Russia that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I saw a Chinese for the last time.
In London and they were sympathetic to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s the last time, in a market.
The Chinese think the same thing about the Whites!
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them say violently anti-Blancs.
My father's not happy that his older daughter is out with a white man.
I also believe that the attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are increasingly rich, prosperity spreads outside the major cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
As I was told, the Russians have precedents against temporary workers without qualifications from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in occupations and areas where they have a great chance of being exploited by their employers or faced with high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Ienissei River, in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard Australian opinions on the Chinese and Aboriginals.
It's really weird that a stranger tells me that I don't support the Chinese, while I've met two of them in my life (including one abroad), not kept bad memories, all people are worth it and, in fact, those in London were very nice, that's the only reason I remembered that they were Chinese.
Otherwise you don't remember who you meet, all people are worth, how to remember who was who.
You know what's weird?
Let you and the other Russian here talk about the Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you're always out with that white guy.
How many Chinese men are with Whites, by comparison?
None, because there is a lot of chance that the parents of these Whites would attack them PHYSICALly.
No measure of impartiality of justice.
However, it is the mother of all the battles and justice in France remains manipulated by highly-marked groups on the left like the union of the judiciary...
@Marabout: forgiveness, but the judicial circles are frankly a sign of right.
When at the Union of the Judiciary, he represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its partiality can be made on the basis of the relativeity of law enforcement in the courts, it orders to remove two obstacles.
That of the observer's political vision, such as that of the factual interpretation of the magistrate.
It remains then the required tool of the law to focus the evaluation on fundamentals.
The measure of its non-observance in all judicial acts of magistrates, including prosecutors, requires a distinction between the error and the partiality of the magistrates.
It would be vain to claim that the acts of justice do not spread among these three groups.
Pretention and ignorance are not subject to objective analysis.
And if all of this is not analysed, how do you say that justice is improving in France?
If it is only through statistics that implicitly reveals that it is well off.
The previous preamble allows you to correctly include the following in the third ratio.
The one of corruption* of the magistrate.
A sensitive subject in proportion to the power of harm* conferred on the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The area concerned is the spoliation* of heirs committed to trial frauds* by successor genealogists mandated by notaries.
This profession receives EUR 150 million in a good year but receives the coverage* guaranteed by the quasi-judicial impunity* of the French notariat.
For understanding their mechanism, a part was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this is part of the statistical improvement* that was moderated by the previous commentary, the judicial institution has produced, in many disputes between genealogist and heirs reluctant to be spoiled, a whole set of jurisprudences contrary to all laws favourable to heirs.
Isn't the presentation of European statistics ignoring such rational criteria a form of lies?
Probably completely prohibitive prices.
Again equipment to rob people with disabilities.
We can say that, but my brother has one of these all-ground tricycles, built customized to its size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors as ever a normal wheelchair, with wheels and heavy tires, could not.
As we say, tastes and colors...
The Tankchairi looks like what Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The Tankchair looks like EPIC.
I think the Whill inventor never had to clean a dog crab on a chenille.
I'm sure my sister would love all the terrain, but it's just too expensive.
The long distance ultra wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled with a longboard pendulum.
Here there are hills they would like.
Prices actually seem high, but there are really people who put this kind of price in a bike, then "you see".
The tricycle of all terrains seems to me particularly useful.
Not all disabled people are poor, though.
Many of them have a reasonable amount of insurance at their disposal.
Only if they have become disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things that they know clearly that they are necessary to us.
We can't really say Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately, it's just a draft, it's not planned to make it.
I CONTENT that the "long distance" wheelchair does not arrive on the market, because apparently there is no way to drive this shitty thing.
Nearly 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza, during intensive bombings of densely populated residential areas.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade in Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying Power of the Palestinian Territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under the age of 18.
Eight-year-old children have lived their entire life under Israeli blockade!
The unique situation in the world, the unacceptable situation, the illegal situation too, as this blockade imposes a "collective penalty" on all civilians in Gaza.
"The entrepreneurs who work on their projects turn a little from their cement to the black market" ...
Oh, this isn't wooden tongue, rather concrete and armed lady...
The references are here to support an argument or a fact.
Antisionist...
The right cement goes into the tunnels!
There's the black market, it's certain, and recognized.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade in Gaza since 2007.
A unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and moral sense.
The United States has a well-maintained land: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to rule because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) excluded it!
Do not forget, too, that after lifting it, Morsi had restored the blockade!!!
And I am a Western, so I agree...
Jonathan...
The Blocus is Israel-Egyptian ...
The children of Gaza live on a underground fortress, built around the people who chose their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've been thinking well.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of the economy of sharing, without a profit.
Many are only looking for one night on Couchsurfing.
So it's to be paid (or at least hoped) in another way.
It's always much less expensive than a hotel, if you need to find the right addresses.
In addition, the owners and tenants who trust often stop using Airbnb and deal directly in cash, thus circumventing Airbnb.
Where's the community in all this.
"Let it rent on"?
No problem with the verb, what's the problem with your grammar?
The verb "to let" is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you didn't notice.
It would be better to have the right assurance for the boat, make sure that it is 100% in line with all the security rules and ask those who manage channels and rivers for permission to carry out a commercial activity there (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I have tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, In short, it is really a nightmare...
Have you thought of the fact that the boats can be moved, stolen and painted, cast, etc.?
The penicles are so slow that if someone was trying to steal it, it would always be near where you left it.
Or misleaded by pirates...
All those Somali immigrants who come here and attack our penis...
Where are you going to grab him?
No Marine The Pen is not right!
Populism?
There is no truth but the truth that explains the facts!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase of wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who defends who?
Who defends what?
In 2017 the Mass will be said!
Capitalism is not going to deplete!
High finance, speculative, therefore plays our jobs with our companies, with our raw materials, so our purchases, our food, our food, with the care structures, so our health, with our debts with our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and our money they hold..
All this for some hyper-mega-obese money.
Until proof of the opposite, FH said: "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy, it is finance."
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed the Minister of Economics as a former of Rothschild Bank, a history of better defending the interests of bankers, only responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there anyone else who comprehends?
You call it how to return his jacket, lower his pants?
Primary and Populistic Response
In fact, we don't know too much what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to save the survivors.
I'm not sure that Spee really " refused" to save the survivors.
One of the aspects of this battle is that none of the parties seemed certain of the exact force of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book " Castles of Steel" suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British cast in the area.
The sea was gorgeous at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the fight ended after sunset, making any rescue operations more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle of the Maluines, where, on the photos showing the survivors who are being rescued, you see a calm and day-round sea.
In addition, the saviors knew that there were no German fighters in the area at this stage.
Hmm, that's not exactly what I remember reading about this battle, so I made a quick search on Wikipédia:
"There was some confusion among the German ships about the fate of the two leather cruisers, who had disappeared in the black after stopping the shooting, and a race-following started.
Leipzig saw something in fire, but approaching it, he saw that it was just a spook.
The Nürnberg, slower than the other German ships, joined the battle late and lived in the Monmouth, pinned and severely damaged but still in motion.
After pointing its headlamps on the flag of the ship, the proposal to go was refused and it opened the fire, finally flowing the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee felt that Good Hope had to escape and stopped research at 2215 hours.
Anxiety about reports suggesting a British casualty in the surroundings, he put cap to the north."
So, if this is true, the Germans, in the dark before the invention of the radar, did not know that a ship had flown, and could therefore not seek survivors.
They also thought that there was a larger squad of the Royal Navy in the area that could have severely damaged them, so in the confusion they defiled to enjoy their advances.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should go through many ships of the Royal Navy.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them harm and cost them about half of their ammunition, condemning them when they were finally taken.
Several votes in favour of the UMP in order to request that a permanently convicted elector be ineligible.
This is a brave position, which would also affect the left-wing elected people well on it.
But noon, it's a joke.
For this IDEE I'M PROPOSING INSCRIPTION TO THE MATERIAL CONSCRIPTION
When is the ban on trade unions in the already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
Enjoined by politicians whose vision of society is confined to these sectors, always prompt to enjoin those themselves who will benefit from their inviolability to obstruct the actions of real politics, who really try to move things, not the beautiful speakers whose immobilism is at the measure of their sufficiency.
I met them in the metro around noon with their small signs of justice" they came from the province and did not make the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of political unions whose members put the enormous power they hold in the service of its party.
It would not defend the same thesis if the right-wing, or even the right-wing, trade unions were to target the personalities of its side and lead a legal-medical war against them.
Your claims are completely free of charge.
If, at present, the right is in favour of judicial news, it is simply that it has committed facts that fall within it!
There is no example of a left-wing personality that has so much to do with Justice, but all those who have been subjected to its attention have not been treated favourably.
On the other hand, it should be remembered that the union of the judiciary on the left is not the only union of magistrates and that it is a minority.
The fact that a minister is so committed to supporting trade unions shows how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you quote may be a minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great in the Chancellor's office, it's not a secret.
It is now questioned whether the "mission" of some judges is not more salvage than instruction.
@ gus - You should be satisfied, the SM is a minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: You forget that the judges are not officials like the other: they are the only ones who have the power to indict and incarcerate all-one-chacun.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I think even the most hungry fool of glory realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised that someone accepts their offer.
Many of them have been used as a trumpet to start a successful career.
One Direction fills the stages around the world.
Others then sold a lot of discs or left for West End.
Popstars, the precursor of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who actually belongs to the jury.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all competed with Eurovision, as many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and all the others participated in competitions in the United States.
In the 1970s and 80s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the light entertainment stars of British television.
Of course, some of them were forgotten.
But that's what happens anyway to most stars who don't participate in the competitions.
Rare are those who, after a tube, succeed in making others.
In any case, most singers/groups can best hope for three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, has fans only in the United Kingdom.
His celebrity comes partly from his marriage with a footballer who breathes through the mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it's more likely to lead to a career than the typical rock path, even though in your dreams you think that all guitar frims that smoke grass in their father's garage and roll three agreements on a primary school poem will probably become stars and the only question is how much they want to touch before even release an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the studied peoples – distance that moves pretty quickly to racism, because sacralist ethnoologists present these far-reaching people as infinitely superstitious and ritual bigotry petris, while most of their ways of doing are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, of practical considerations in everyday life.
Except that you are unambiguously interpreting in the opposite sense.
Either, but rather than saying that the drum is of a sacred character, is it better not to admit that our Marianne and our Molières have a little sacred character as well?
Our bias is reminded of seeing the sacred as a kind of well-defined object and embodied in the religious sphere.
Very interesting article, whatever.
It's ephemere deco to meuble the vacuum.
Nothing more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrative figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacred always lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw to the orties interpretations of not at all scientists who last the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When does a comparative criticism of disciplines for laughing a little?
Because what applies to archaeology also applies to the interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a dose of healthy modesty.
Your disrespect for archaeologists is absolutely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that treasures, valuable testimony to reconstituate history, to understand societies, and the example of comparative archaeology here is exciting.
This method is not very old and earlier archaeologists relied on their "instinct" and knowledge, and could be mistaken.
Today there are technical and scientific means so efficient that the investigation is better but can always be jeopardized by other discoveries!
There is in the middle (and old) polemic about the chamanism advanced by prehistorician Jean Clottes (see his book "Les chamanes de la préhistoire", especially the increased re-editment of the scientific controversy, published in the editions La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this very informative article
The hetero men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could get into it.
So it's over between us?
I really don't understand why can't we go on to three?
This newspaper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the caniveau?
No, but we're not against a play on that.
We couldn't look at a musical comedy on this on the other hand, that would be too gay!
We could expect to have this kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your test offer is almost finished, can I suggest you pass to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers Mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays true journalists, courageous, to write on the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their risks and risks.
Rather than messing with those little ass jokes.
Not very smart.
Then go away.
If these "children ass jokes" shock you so much, you don't have to participate, do you?
You also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is absolutely possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is that the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people are laughing at it?
However, we can find the amateur video of the crash on the net...
video amateur crash on the net... ??
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images, it is only to protect its interests in no case those of the pilot.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the pilots, it would have left the safety because at the time or another vehicle (e.g., switch-off) entered the circuit.
But we had to finish quickly before the typhon we knew it was coming, but for which the FOM did not consider it appropriate to advance the time of departure (tele, pub, money...).
But apart from that, they protect the pilots well.
Well seen, I also share that opinion.
But there is also that if the very British FOM brings in the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance to beat English that then led...
You're losing yourself on this blog, my dear Dayrton.
But it's okay, I've got a little time to take all your c****** stuff out.
No, just no.
There have been lots of conspiracy in F1, but never one that puts commissioners at risk of death for a far-reaching history of the possibility of one pilot's victory at the expense of another.
It's not the FOM that comes out of security because it's the FIA.
Size nuance.
In view of amateur images, the lack of image allows the FIA to avoid embarrassing questions of the type: How does the Commissioner operate a green flag in full intervention and continue to do so after the accident (see full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is considered too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident, but because one of the Commissioners clearly sees a shaken green flag, sign that the race can normally resume and that we are more under a yellow flag diet.
Some comments show a dark disconfort of F1.
Yes, dear Etienne, the race is no longer under the yellow flag regime APRES the place of the accident, from which the green flag is agitated.
That's the usual procedure.
The police station just downstream of the accident (if any, it may be 10 meters as well as 100 meters after the accident) shakes the green to tell the pilots to take a normal turn.
Sensationalism sells pubs.
Before I thought that the media were an integral part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda offensive, but I fear that in the end it's just for money.
And sex, let's not forget sex, fear of having no sex life, the publicity and the media are good to sell us things that are supposed to improve our sex life.
The information does exactly the same thing.
Doing the buzz with information that you really don't need to worry about is just to keep scaring people so you can keep controlling them.
"When the tabloids allude about Ebola, we all catch fear" It should be "derived", not "alent".
Given the medical reference, "coughing" is much better said in this context than "drawing".
I wonder if any people who are in trouble that Ebola could start spreading by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You're giving them too much honor.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the apocalypse approaching.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You're confusing Ebola and Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that ridiculizes this abject pseudo-journalism beautifully and firmly.
That made me laugh.
It depressed me that the media talked about most of the things with this reverse optimism.
The goal is once again to keep us scared and scared enough (without the hysteria) so that the government can get rid of us when it needs it.
I think it is perfectly logical that, if we have to face a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that he himself invented.
Is there not something fundamentally problematic about the idea of governance by fear?
Congratulations for this post, and to be still from this world almost 35 years later.
Also at first it must have been terrible, given the context of the 1980-90s.
I'm bluffed, living with the certainty of being there for years .....
Testimonial completely unnecessary.
As always when you're talking about science.
Not only the testimony serves nothing: taken isolated, they cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have a negative influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
@Trafic: Testimonials cannot be used as scientific material.
This may be why we refrain from asking questions to patients in psychiatry when we have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric file mentions that my psychiatrist mother explains that I was telepathically educated by her stiefmother.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say it's bullshit, it's a subjective testimony that doesn't matter.
Ah, because the evidence of a fact (= this testimony, which proves the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) is not useful in a scientific approach?
So, what's your basis for research?
On fantasies?
Do you put fantastic theories and facts (= giving rise to verifiable testimony) at the same level?
"Resilience" means the word "spoke" by grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who consider themselves to be great psychologists after reading D'ansembourg.
@Jim: There are plenty of sense-free buzzwords in psychos.
Cyrulnik has made us the “resistance”.
As it is a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope that he will have set us a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resistance.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could save us all from Farage and company???
Doesn't that make you think of Team America?
Seriously, it's not a good idea to get the Sentinels out of the air...
And why?
It was a great series and it looks like those who come up with it are aware of it!
So let us leave our salvation to the Almighty who can do miracles.
But how are they gonna do so that the kids hang?
The only solution that comes to mind is humour like pipi-caca, which would kill the series.
It was already a series for children.
The kids were hanging.
Oh, because it's a children's series?
The UKIP works for the Mysteries.
So keep your Team America.
Still in Supermarionation?
It will not be the same if you don't see the sons and the animation is well done. :-)
I look forward to seeing this (although being an adult), but I hope that it will give the idea to a chain of recasting the old people.
The series has almost never stopped being broadcast here in Australia; it has been at least 40 years since one hour on Saturday and Sunday at 6:00 p.m.
Since the arrival of the free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-order commercial channels and can always be seen at these times.
And in addition to the episodes of half an hour now goes to 5:30 p.m., from Monday to Friday!
Okay, I'm probably a 60-year-old "sorry" guy, but I don't watch this series every day!
There is no "mount of the temple" in or under the mosque of the esplanades !!!
The radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
By the way, all Israeli searches under and around the mosque of the esplands for decades have not been able to find anything.
The mountain of the temple if it exists it is elsewhere.
Can be argentinian??
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the eplanade of the mosques was built.
His peak, or the dome of the Rocker, is sparkled in the middle of the Omar mosque.
For Muslims, Mahomet climbed to paradise from this rock.
For the Jews, this is the Mount Moriah where Abraham fails to sacrifice his son Isaac.
As it was taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also counts on its extremists, it is good to remind them regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahou, the latter had accepted the plan in two states, and has consistently slashed it!).
It is also good to show how peaceful the annexation of Jerusalem is.
Can God recognize his own?
The shortest Jewish joke: "God be praised!"
To beg us tourism in Israel, we are often shown by young naïds with half-dressed dresses, swayed on the beach.
The reality, as usual, is much different from what advertising shows us, as can be seen on the photo that illustrates the article.
It's a little scared anyway.
And this photo is a beautiful work of propaganda!
It's a shame that the photographer of Reuters did not take on photo the hundreds of Palestinians allowed to return to the Temple Mount and who prefer to spoil the Jewish faithful down there, praying at the Wall of Worships.
@Mat, If this photo disrupts you, it's right, it's neither the newspaper nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she's sending out that you have to condemn.
This system is not durable and will end up crying.
The only way to end this system is the revolution.
Since the economy seems to go off, large companies have benefited enormously from their employees.
They have succeeded in convincing their employees that they have the chance to have a job and that they cannot afford to increase wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given more and more pay to the small elite at the top.
You are right, it is not sustainable, but it will only change in this country when workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of shaking and spoiling when someone else strikes, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their strike is not only about their problems, but also show your employer that people are not impunly disturbed.
Unless we abandon democracy, in which case it is sustainable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where the social and environmental conditions are the worst.
Like China and India, for example.
All of this can't end well.
It's because we're in democracy that it kept.
Did you vote for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (PTCI) aims to increase the profits of companies held by these people by shortcutting national governments through secret courts.
That seems amazing, but that's exactly what the investor-state dispute resolution mechanism (ISDS) proposed in the agreement serves.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to warn people about the unimaginable damage that this agreement will have on our lives.
It is only recently that we are starting to talk about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you will understand what is being negotiated in your back.
Didn't Churchill say "blood, sweat and tears"?
This makes excellent benefits, while digital money has no reason to fall and even less to push on the trees.
The next weak link will probably be the car market.
This man is right, at XVIII there were trade unions in all regiments
In the very French Catholic army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Leave her (finally, her officers, the others, no one knows anything) believe in the safe of the eternal values of France, and she will fight and shut her mouth.
And then with the decline in the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: dissolving the idea of Nation, having this little relic, that is comforting.
Even if it's more and more uncomfortable for her...
You still miss the list of married men, celibates, married women, celibates, lost dogs, and I don't know what else.
If you don't write the French correctly, I'm a unionist.
You're being warned, it's your fault.
In order to defend the interests of the category, the professions protected with trade unions have already been subjected to enough, which has created a breaking of equality with other citizens.
It is asked not to laugh about the fear of the risk of an employee.
One can imagine a system of freedom of expression without trade unions, or then without the right of strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
If you don't, you'll be insured.
And with the chariots that are preparing, the government welcomes it.
What safety are you talking about?
Ignorance in fact...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other officials, because this is the subject commented here...
Delete "by means of his delegates" in article 8 of the preamble of the Constitution of 1946.
He will become: "8.
Any worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions as well as in the management of enterprises."
This is absolutely essential with the outbreak of information power.
And yet you have opened, probably read and commented on an article specifically entitled "The Great British Bake Off Review". ?????
Wait, the section was there, all empty.
I thought we should start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's wedding that I looked at, and I can tell you that some have been well seasoned.
In the episode of Joffrey's marriage we have one of the best moments (this was the wine) in the history of television.
Also, pie mmmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
It's the second time in the aftermath that, strangely, the show ends with a win of the worst baker; no one has done like "bum, here's my fucking cake now drink it and bend in front of your master"!
Perhaps the additional pressure of friends and parents outside finally had an impact on them?
In previous weeks, all these external persons were kept away.
And there is also this idea of "playing security, there is always next week" that disappears the last week.
I like cooking, but I don't think I'm in charge of that.
I am grateful to those who do so and thus offer us great entertainment and drive us to try new things.
Forward for GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year's last challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually spend days doing them, and they had to stick one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really difficult to start, I don't know how they were able to choose a winner.
In Luis, the only real defect they could have found was a little dry base (even though I agree with Hollywood to say that the green glazing on Richard's mill did not give a desire, anyway Richard had already lost at that time).
I have to admit that several challenges in this series seem a little artificial due to the time spent.
There is also cancer that watches, with solar wind blows.
Decisively, everything succeeds in this moment.
A bad time to spend for humanity, we hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UVs are blocked mainly by the ozone layer that is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UVs.
So even if the magnetic field was weakening, there would not be enough solar wind to " hunt" stratosphere ozone.
There would be even more, and therefore less U.V. and "cancers".
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UVs.
They have a lot of useful functions that you don't suspect.
If one is limited to man, they have the interest of allowing us to have bones ( Vitamin D synthesis), to heat us (less than the infrareds), to modulate our immune system and, apparently, to improve our morality.
The ozone layer blocks carcinogen UVCs and lets the UVA and most UVBs pass.
You know that you don't have to be condescending and consider your interlocutor as a deceased when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor precision that was included in the commentary, which itself intends to show pedagogy.
Without saying that I'm a melanoma habitual, the UVs only ACCELATE its development.
They don't PROVIEVE it.
For proof: not all bronzed people must have melanomas.
Either, when a doctor tells you that you must avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cellar, better not listen because UVs are necessary for all humans.
Excess, on the other hand, is like everything: he kills.
But for other reasons.
UVs directly cause melanoma.
Can we fold it?
And, more importantly, can we pass it to the mixer?
or go to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those who are interested in this have established that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied to it and the robustness of iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable for the use for which it is intended.
I think the army would need something more resistant and has therefore not yet adopted iPhone6 as first-line communication equipment.
But for the rest of us,
It's still a good choice.
the majority of those interested have established that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied to it.
Except Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already folded?
We're making this joke in every conversation.
I decided to count them.
This is the fourth joke on the folding I read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like that.
Before installing specific software, it is imagined that the phone has been removed from the main production chain and it is wrong to see how it could return.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm..................................
The most likely is that it is a production unit on which the iOS has not been properly installed and is therefore stuck with the plant test code installed.
I don't know how they do these things at all.
But would they put test software on everyone?
Photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of FCC or CE logo and the presence of a red prototype connector.
ah the article for bobo by excellence.
We want cheap products and we are surprised that the industry produces in "industrial" We put out super u but all the teachings and small trade are concerned How to eat good, bio avac 1650€ (average salary in francs)?
But to answer your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After all, everyone is free to put its priorities wherever he hears it.
For me, food is one.
Come on, I'll kiss you.
They call bobos, or better boboecolos, people who see the world through an ideological "software" that leads them to unconnect from reality.
It's the total disaggregation of thought-reason.
They are gesticulating experts, for example, claim to save the planet because they avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in tartufery, joining the left-caviar, from which they are sometimes derived, for example, condemning CO2 releases while passing their holidays to the Maldives.
The vast majority of our citizens do not support this mixture of heavy ideology and tartufery, too, are not surprised to often encounter criticism about them.
Wow, thank you for this complete and comprehensive theory as well as for all the details associated (plane, shower...).
I'd love to be part of it, but I don't find myself there.
The concept is not so complicated.
Boboecolos are monoblocs.
Did you understand the concept of the left-caviar?
Well, you are able to understand the concept of boboecolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
Classification would be more complicated if we were interested in ecolos short.
Boboecolo is part of it but only represents the most visible fraternity of the ecolos because it is the one that infestes the media.
Here's a beautiful giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look at this giraffe in front.
She's so badly done that she looks vaguely like a female nude.
Shh, you're next to the plate.
One must be part of the microcosm of art to understand the amazing beauty of the truth of this work.
But you simply have no legitimacy to comment because you have not spent countless decades to study and flatter great artists.
The important thing is not that Emin can't draw and always seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fantasticly rich and famous with no artistic ability.
That's art.
No, it's pigs.
The fact that Emin can't draw
That is not really a proven fact.
This is rather an opinion.
Unless the only thing you could appreciate is realistic reproductions of dogs that smoke by playing billiard.
Judging art may be problematic, but not in this case.
Describing is much more than simply representing the real.
If you're just looking for this, a camera will do the case.
The author also speaks of Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image talk about itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There are still savings: horseback riding activities, the number of republic guard horses or the status of generals who are no longer in active service....
(The honesty requires France to say that its workforce is decreasing, but as all countries have done, sometimes more drasticly, to start with Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
Operational without support, it quickly finds its limits!
A unique approach, when we observe weaknesses, weaknesses in our defence tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow for the local authorities concerned, which lose a dimension of their activities, or even part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctification?
@edmond: That's what I said, look elsewhere where to make savings but especially not at my home, at my home it's really not possible...
That's exactly what you're proposing to do, looking elsewhere where gabegie is sure.
Let all those who have sided little or prosecuted the military thing dare come to say here, the eyes in the eyes that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without laughing...
Applying the same potion to the public service as a whole and public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi, look at the inflation of public jobs in other departments and you will understand why Defence can feel a bit burdensome!
Well, yes, the economies on which everyone agrees to say that we have to do it, we need to see it somewhere, right?
Deficiency, those who fall on the murder when it comes to their homes, poor dears.
I'd have to do it, but above all it doesn't fall on me because in that case it's a crime and not an economy.
Guignoles, go!
In what way will closing the Grace Val weaken our defense tool in Sahel?
With respect to local authorities, the history is repeated at each closure of post, maternity, hospital, barrack.
But everyone is for the economy of course.
It's weird, a Mayor of the UMP who wants compensation and does not rejoice in the savings made in public spending.
This article is really the most awesome thing I've ever read!
This embarrassing moment when the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It's the depression to have his Facebook wire rolled out and to see that 80% of his friends started their statutes with the phrase "This embarrassing moment".
I think they're gonna make a movie of it.
It will probably be based on fun scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex in the bus by going to work and only realises that his jewel came back into his pants.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely stupid.
Not really, according to me, the author takes the role of the typical British man who has always been taught to inflict his emotions and crush his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of her return on stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
You realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to know who will have the rights?
I don't have the Internet.
So I don't think I can comment.
I don't have a computer.
Oh, my God, I need to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe how much this article is the most amazing thing I've ever read!
Charlie has really shown that he is at the top of the cosmic universe as Satiric journalism is!
I'm going to the reverse!
It is absolutely necessary that I share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the illumination and discover the incredible fulgurance and insurpassable genius that blew Mr. Brooker's keyboard as a divine light.
Oh, my God, that was really nasty.
Especially if they're neither women, nor travestis.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive evolution in democracy: the rise in effective regional policies and associative initiatives.
So far, we have confiscated the right to save our planet by States who play the tartuffs at each meeting to save the planet.
We therefore decide, citizens, to take things in hand.
With the Commissioner they planted on energy, all these beautiful recommendations have flew away ....
Translation: Winds and solar farms are the Round points of tomorrow.
All funded by the tributary.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful to its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the line is not fully controlled, it is better to limit it to laboratories.
Renewable energies are our only salvation, provided, of course, that our consumption is drastically reduced.
Renewable electricity to control CO2 emissions?
France is in no way concerned.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions to production and epsilon for the other stages.
Electricity by renewable wind or PV is already more GHG on the other stages, especially gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for intermittence.
Replacement of nuclear by renewable wind or PV would be contrary to the fight against CO2.
Christial I do not insult you myself I am Doctor of State in Physics 1981 and I have done research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove the opposite of what I said.
For what I didn't say is you who lend me ideas I didn't say anything about Germany in fact nothing in fact you didn't answer what I said and as all the right people demolish the interlocutor I never do.
I also quote the conclusion of experts mandated by the German Government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is a non-profitable and inefficient way to reduce GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emissions if you do not count uranium extraction and construction and if you do not count water vapour with less greenhouse gas effect than Co2 it is true to remind the two-thirds of energy produced by a nuclear power plant of water vapour and a little in the water of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you talked about Pakistan as a "South Asian giant"...!
The last time Pakistan won against Hindustan.
I am not surprised, most Indians who post comments want to read and comment only on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had called India a giant of South Asia...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players are participating, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a box of Pandora full of corruption and mafia.
With regard to the ISL, today's opening game was surprisingly interesting, the Athletic of Kolkata imposing 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a lot of way to go.
Compared with the billions and billions that India spends on the IPL cricket and now on football, how could we one day compete with our "noise neighbors"...
The low cost launcher race pays cash.
It's a shame for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible lack of design appears only with a too cold helium.
So we may not be in a defect in design, but in implementation...
Unlike arian space, which is a private society, it seems that Soyouz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer..
They may be paying the satellites in fregates that know..
This is all the more annoying as many media retrieve the only titles of articles - and many readers only hold these titles.
In total, this creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
In agreement with you, the title is not appropriate, it is unjustly questioning the project while it is only a launcher problem.
