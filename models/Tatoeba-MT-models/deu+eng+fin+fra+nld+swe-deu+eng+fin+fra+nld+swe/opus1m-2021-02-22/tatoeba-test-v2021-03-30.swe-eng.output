The other kids call her Nasse.
It meant a lot to me.
I'm not good at dancing.
I told Tom to take it easy.
I'm an old man now.
Tom teaches.
She's done too much work.
She's stubborn.
Give Tom a handle.
You wouldn't like Tom.
Does Tom know how you feel about him?
Tom wondered if what Mary said was true.
We'll never agree.
It's uncertain whether the letter ever came in or not.
We haven't done anything.
You lost your pen.
You're gonna be in bed all day, aren't you?
Tom can't do that.
Tom crawled under stitch.
I didn't even know her name.
Are you really going to do that?
Give this to Tom.
Tom knows it's true.

Then try it.
It didn't really affect us.
Did Tom vote?
I'm walking like a penguin.
Have I forgotten anything?
You're longer than me.
Congratulations on birthday.
I don't even want you here.
I like to go to new places and see new things.
I have to sit down.
Aren't we friends?
Her speech bored me.
I can't eat chocolate.
I think we should do what Tom suggests, unless anyone else has a better proposal.
The ice is very thick.
Do you understand?
I can only speak for myself.
Tell me what the problem is.
Tom beat Mary.
You should've liked it.
I've got some more.
I'm using the computer.
Six were invited, the boy included.
Kate's cold.
I know you miss your family.
What was your plan?
Tom seems bored.
He's not angry.
There is no doubt about who will be elected.
He got hurt.
Maybe I should find a new job or an interesting hobby to keep myself motivated.
It's weird.
Have you read the Sagan about the ring trilogy?
I'm a man now.
Greek is not an easy language.
Thank you for taking care of my dog.
She advocated equality.
What are you looking at?
Dog young.
Stop talking to me.
Say goodbye, Gilly Brother.

My friends didn't let me down during the trial.
Tom shot me in his leg.
I was just pissed off.
Stay down.
You weren't here then.
Here comes Tom.

I need an answer.
I hate my computer.

I hope you find Tom.
Mary works in the city's public library.
We're different.
Come back in the van.
She helped the old man over the road.
Nobody's too old to learn.
I'd do anything for love.
Two men with ski masks went into the bank.
This book belongs to the school library.
Nothing of it was real.
There must be a pattern.
It hurts to have to say this, but that's the truth.
Tom tricked me.
Tom helps.
One morning he saw a cute girl.
This tree isn't even close to being the highest in the socks.
Let me take a look.
Tom wants our help.
Time's over.
My father's healthy.
We can save many lives.
If you don't have any money, you can make it without it.
I'm afraid to go home.
Just say it.

Put the cake on the table.
I know you're angry.
Do you need anything?
I want a couple of gloves.
That's exactly what I needed.
I'm from Brazil.
I'm already late.
Even Mom knows about it.
He should've done it already.
Room service, please.
Who were you talking to?
The boy took the cat's tail.
How do you know that?
I got a lot of mosquito beet.
I'm unemployed.
This medicine will cure your cold.
Does this remind you of someone?
I'd like to talk to Tom between four eyes.
He'll fall for the temptation.
The TV doesn't work.
I can explain that.
She's acting like a child.
How does it look?
Mary thinks she has superpowers.
I know all this.
Everyone needs to know.
After the stop, the train accelerated quickly.
What did that mean?
Who do you want to talk to?
No one has asked you to agree, but at least you can accept that there are people who have opinions other than you?
Tom dropped the book.
I'm the best.
English is hard, isn't it?
I can go to school in ten minutes.
Are you ready?
She couldn't think of seeing him again.
Even during working time, I pay for my Internet dependence.
I never thought it would be so hard to create an iPad app.
You weren't gone long.
Both Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I can't get down in town.
At least it wasn't boring.
Can you freeze it down?
Tom blinked with the lights.
Are you threatening me?
Tom's worried.
I used to like coming here.
This isn't a fish.
Maybe Tom and Mary didn't do what everyone said they did.
There's no one here who's called that.
It's time to go.
All three men smiled.
Come and sit down.
It must be enough.
Tom made his parents happy.
Tom needs me.
My motor saw's broken.
You think she's pretty, what?
He lived a simple life.
This will take years.
I made a mistake in the word.
I don't like this book.
One ink fish has ten arms.
She didn't come until two.
I am.
That was very good.
Come and talk to me.
He took care of the baby.
Leave me alone!
Never had I seen such a peaceful vision.
Tom's fast.
Of the Finns, about 4.9 per cent are Finnish Swedish, i.e. people with Swedish as a mother tongue.
Unfortunately, Tom did.
What is the difference between American and British English?
I'll read the book.
I made the wedding cake.
Use a scalpel, not an axle.
Could you write down the link to that site?
She annexed a picture.
The walls in the old house were not straight.
Where is she?
It feels really good.
Why do you like it?
What would you say if you were in this situation?
Give me three weeks.
The driver turned the wheel to the right.
I'm in the wind.
Tom said he didn't eat meat.
Did you win?
Everyone's dreaming.
Meat is made of wheat.
How did you get this?

I don't have any close friends.
There's something crazy going on here.
I'm grateful for your help.
I know you've been busy.
In what way is it different?

I admit I've neglected my duties.
Good question.
Oslo is the capital of Norway.
Where's the nearest gas station?
This is wrong.
It's been three years since we married.
I'm going crazy.
I cultivated tomatoes last year and they were very good.
We use edible pins instead of knife and gaffel.
I should have done exactly what you did.
I'd need one.
I got a job offer.

I'm a little upset.
Give it a minute.
On the one hand, he's nice, but on the other hand, he's lazy.
Do you know the rules?
I've let the tailor wear a new suit for me.
I thought it was a joke.
Tom and I, we both miss you very much.
Please.
Tell me why she's crying.
It's an old manuscript.
You wouldn't enjoy it.
I'm talking to the principal.
I opened the door.
Tom didn't pretend to hear Mary calling his name.
I decided not to do that again.
What did they think?
He wiped the sweat from his face.
Wash your face.
When I came home, I discovered I had lost my wallet.
She never talks bad about other people.
I'm waiting for the business to open.
There's snow on the ground.
You want these things, don't you?
Where's Tom born?
I have everything I wanted.
I feel completely helpless.
Don't you love me anymore?
I'll see you later!

Tom must have hit his head.
Tom was cheating on a nurse while he was in the hospital.
How big will it be?
He acted fast and shut down the fire.

Be patient.
Buy me a tooth cream tub when you're in the shop.

Here's Tom.
I wish it was so simple.
I'm awful.
I'm going to study English this afternoon.
There's almost no milk left in the glass.
Tom can't see you.
He's got a big ego.
Life isn't permanent.
The man finally acknowledged what he had done.
Tom's got off.
I was almost driven by a car.
Tom's very brave.
Shouldn't you go home?
Australia is not Austria.
Spindles spinning nets.
I guess that can't help.
Tom came here to ask for help.
I would like to send you a recommended letter.
We can all go home.
Tom spent his whole life studying sharks.
Do you want those pralins?
Who's Sami's father?
Your bike is much newer than mine.

I'll try.
Her voice was repeated through the quiet house.
We're in Boston.
Turn on the radio, please.
She reads a book.
Do you need anything else?
Don't even talk to me.
You have to repay your debts.
It's okay with me.
I'm going to work at 7:00.
I'm happy.
What's so funny?

We bought something for Mary.
Can you come closer?
I have a mark.
She bought a new computer.
We cut trees with an ax.
It's scary.
I live in northern Sweden.
When he came home, the kids already slept.
So where are you going?
By the way, how many of you for a diary?
That's disgusting!
Hurry up, or we'll be late for lunch.
I had a good time.
Tom asked me if I wanted to cook.
