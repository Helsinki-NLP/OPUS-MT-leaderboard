Food debt to European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured in the euro area is the rapid rise in food prices.
In the 13 euro area countries, the rate of depreciation was higher than expected in November - after the 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 per cent was recorded, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are based on only 3 percent, reports Bloomberg.
Unlike the American, British and Canadian banknotes, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the Leitzsins. In your opinion, the fall in interest would encourage the rise in raw materials prices and the slight fall in unemployment to create a spiral of inflation.
The ECB aims to keep inflation below two percent, or at least close to the two percent mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in the mill: inflation needs to be "agreed" in order to exclude future needs.
With 3.3 per cent in November, the inflation rate reached a 12-year record in Germany; in Spain the rate climbed from 3.6% to 4.1 per cent.
The rise in food and energy prices is responsible for increasing inflation in the euro area.
The MATIF wheat quotations increased by 88 percent, and the price for soybeans also reached a record dog since 1973.
Also in food oil and milk products, there was a significant price increase in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil increased by 52 percent this year - last month, the price per fiber of black gold reached almost US dollars 100.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 per cent in 2008, but in 2009 it is expected that inflation will fall to 1.9 per cent.
For the next 3-4 months analysts are based on a 3% inflation rate, but the average annual rate is 2.1 per cent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to reduce interest rates twice.
Gallup spots government crisis
After a long period of stagnation, the number of Fidesz-sympathizers has grown significantly until early December. For the first time since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while the consent of the socialists according to Gallup has reached a 13 percent low point that has never been present.
The difference among the party-reliable voters is clear thanks to the high determination of opposition supporters: more than two thirds (71 percent) are opposed to a fifth (20 percent) consent for the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are under the parliamentary entry burden: they reach 2% in the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last bottom point, the general economic mood has continued to deteriorate - never before was the proportion of those who judged the economic situation of the country as "extremely bad" so high (41 per cent), while another 46 per cent considered it "relatively bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, the families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the next year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation; only one tenth expects improvement.
A Gallup survey conducted in December showed that 71% of respondents - a historically high - considered the Prime Minister's work as "every bad as right".
Thirteen percent of respondents have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the share of supporters for Viktor Orbán represents 38 percent.
About 54% do not trust the Head of Government at all, compared with 27% of mistrust against the Head of the Fidesz Party.
One of the indicators of political mood is the number of people who think that we could get the discontent with the Prime Minister even without a change of government.
After the unrests last October, 35% had voted for the remainder of the government and the Head of Government, today this proportion was only 20%, while the relative majority (33 percent) saw the solution only in re-elections.
Asked for their interest in the referendum, 60 percent replied that they would participate "with certainty" and another 20% would give their vote "probably".
By comparison, if Parliamentary elections were to take place this Sunday, only 55% would go to the urns "with certainty" and another 15% would consider their participation to be "probably". In view of these trends, the result of the referendum would be predictable.
74% would vote against the study fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% against the hospital daily allowance.
Turning to the group of people "with security" participating in the referendum, the proportions of opponents of study, practice and hospital fees would even be 81, 84, or 89 per cent.
Also the most expensive, Tesco increased by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade area have also maintained this year the average price increase of 16% from last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörs trade triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of Napi has also increased 16 percent this year, but price increases of over 1,000 HUF have been recorded in all hypermarkets.
After the prices in the food markets were "abducted" last December, the price decline was not drastic compared to the at least high previous baseline level.
However, it is certainly dissuasive for consumers that what they paid for last year is not even available for 10,000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Napi" basket exceeded the magical 10,000-HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the investigated markets.
The highest price was 10.573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6.800 HUF.)
Prices for unicum and live fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, whereas prices for bone filets, nuts and mohn have risen sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but there were 1 kg of bread raised for 139 forints at Auchan.
There was no competitive price crash on the product to less than 200 forints.
Also surprising here was the price of a two-liter Coca-Cola pan bottle of less than 200 Forint, so the drink including pan cost only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year in the "Napi" basket comparison also cut out the most expensive, and Cora the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased the prices in the "Napi" basket compared to the Christmas prices last year by 15, while Tesco and Auchan have increased by 18 percent each.
The difference between the cheapest basket of the previous year and the most expensive of this year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest basket of last year and the most expensive of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1.480.00 HUF.
The average price increase was still 1.206.00 forint in the previous year, but the VAT increase was noticeable at prices at last Christmas.
It is precisely this process that has affected trade: it seems that the stores did not have the right to decide what price range they should apply to the individual articles, since the impact of the price increase on consumer behaviour was unpredictable.
(If the dealer is bad about the speed of circulation of a product, it can fall by substantial profits in the price range based on the traffic intensity.)
The price of the "Napi" basket in the past year was so radical that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, whereas the price difference in the cheapest basket was only 844 Forint.
This year such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost 1.630.00 Forint more than in the previous year, and even at the cheapest price rise was 1.284.00 Forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase was shown, and the price of daily consumer goods in the hypermarkets has risen by more than 30 per cent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic foods, the Statistical Office found a more than 30 % price over the 12-month period.
So in approximately beside flour also for eggs.)
However, if you take a look into the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible in the latter case, since the price level of the product already expensive in the previous year has risen by barely more than 10 percent even in the worst case.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - they were able to wipe the drastic price increase on the multis.
In the golden trade triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; it is constantly reported by good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three stores no longer look at the prices.
It is purchased from all large quantities, sustainable food goes in pallets over the shop tables.
Wednesday morning morning there were endless snakes at the cash bank in all three store houses when the number of customers suddenly exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so many multis complain to opinion researchers that they could not even reach the planned sales, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Frequently, disinfectants are saved
More than a thousand infections have been reported in hospitals due to incorrect use of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, the overload of staff - all factors that are not directly conducive to the control of infections, according to the chief doctor of the National Epidemiology Centre.
In many places, disinfectants are also saved.
A MRSA infection has recently been diagnosed in the traumatology department of the János Hospital.
The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient who was transferred to the hospital after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection here.
The injured person of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but shortly later the man had to return with a MRSA infection. Since then, an important surgery has not yet been carried out due to the bacteria still in the patient’s body.
By 10 December of this year, 1094 infections caused by multiresistant pathogens from hospitals were reported to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to Karolina Böröcz, the leading physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
So many infections caused by multiresistent pathogens have been recorded in hospitals with certainty, but the dark figure is likely to be higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were triggered by MRSA, which is resistant to methicillin-oxacillin Staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium bears about one third of the people in their nose without causing a disease.
SA-related infections (such as throat inflammation, mantle inflammation, skin inflammation or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well healable.
However, if the medicines are too high doses or are used incorrectly, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which are rapidly spreading in hospitals under appropriate conditions, are produced from the well-responsive bacteria.
Especially in patients with weakened immune system, or permanently poor, but also in elderly, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria may cause serious infections such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of the János Hospital, MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents belong to the hospital everyday.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA said that there is only no place where it is not sought.
Resistent to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the nurses wear rubber gloves and masks in the care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment" - Tibor Nyulasi says.
While patients are being studied for MRSA when they are sent to the hospital, infection cannot be avoided.
Too rare sampling
The majority of the infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, but the conditions and circumstances currently prevailing are unfavourable for the control of the emergence or spread of the multiresistent pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection is predominantly occurring in hospitals and old-age homes, the meals should examine the patients received and insulate MRSA infected immediately.
In the Hungarian hospitals, however, microbiological sampling is not practiced as often.
Not least because there are no grants from the public health insurance fund for this investigation.
Most cases would therefore only come to the light of the day when the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical head of the epidemiology centre.
There are strict recommendations from the European Union for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and disease images.
Antimicrobial therapy is intended to be targeted, i.e. microbiological studies are necessary in order not to create resistance to the medicine, but this directive is not always complied with by hospitals.
Among the ambulances, or in primary care patients, microbiological samples are even more rare, says Karolina Böröcz.
Saved for disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most commonly transferred from one patient to another by the nurse.
This is why handwashing or wearing gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but in the local hospitals there is not always the possibility of isolating the infected patients.
The rooms are often overfilled, the beds are close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, unfortunately, it is even in the less well-funded hospitals that disinfectants are saved, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that directly promote the formation of infections.
Such infections are proven to be far less frequent there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped where these protective measures are observed, says Karolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
To control MRSA infections causes huge costs to health insurance, so they are fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA and its control were maintained in the government programme.
After first signs, the program is successful - as published data prove, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared the prevention of the formation of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals one of its priorities.
Death Guide Police Officer was not drunk
In the case of the car accident with fatal exit caused by the police chief of the XXII district, the official opinion is now available.
The now resigned chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholic nor drug-induced," said Attila Morvai, the press speaker of the Budapest Supreme Public Prosecutor on Friday after the official opinion was presented on the case.
The opinion confirmed the results of the first investigation, which, according to the chief of police, had not consumed alcohol before he was taxing.
The former chief of police entered Kossuth Lajos Street with his own passenger car in the XXII district, driving a 55-year-old man who crossed the road in a non-marked place.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a lesser circumstance - the conductor has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the Zebra Strip, priority .)
The pedestrian is in the hospital after his delivery.
According to police reports, the director suffered a shock, then revoked his duties and asked for retirement.
The Budapest Attorney General has initiated its investigation into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former chief of police had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
Further EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed three loan agreements in Budapest on Friday, totalling EUR 400 million.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects implemented by the Cohesion Fund. The 100 million loan contract has already been signed earlier, and the current agreement concerns the use of the EUR 200 million granted.
The sum of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan contract is also to be used for the budget financing of educational projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will later be decided in the context of the extension of the loan contract.
In the field of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly be part of research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
The metro line 4 was also discussed at the meeting.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of subway financing with the EU, the original Treaty and any amendments will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects totalling EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The interest rates are EURIBOR-bound, the loan is made available by the EIB with a 8-year delay, free of provision.
Bulgaria, the EU Real Estate Paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - all of Europe looks carefully at the Balkans, which was previously rarely mentioned.
What, where, and who still buys the cheapest market in the EU, but which is faster?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently undoubtedly the most desired patch for real estate purchases in the Eastern European area, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Between the mountains, the Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular regions, but by the sea Albena, the "gold coast", the "sun coast", and the historical towns of Sozopol and Nessebar are the racers, but properties around Kavarna and Balcik are increasingly required.
According to estimates by Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior also devoted to attracting investors earlier or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and the extremely favourable area of Russia also counts more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers attractive offers - commercial and office areas offer highest yields.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive European golfing paradises, and thus attracts tourists in the other two seasons, besides the summer and winter season.
Foreseeing investors therefore already buy in large style, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who purchase real estate in Bulgaria also strive to change their life.
Most buyers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and in the ski areas.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle buy either revitalized real estate by 50-100,000 euros, or downstairs houses by 5-15,000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connection and accessibility as well as communication possibilities are widely written, but the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are also crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the Top Ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group consists of businessmen who invest in the goal of a medium- to long-term growth in value.
However, real estate in the capital is becoming constantly more expensive, due to the ever growing demand.
Although real estate prices within the EU are the lowest in Bulgaria, in the past five years there has been a price increase of 21 per cent per year.
The price of the real estate prices exceeds far the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As Minister for the Environment Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will be continued by ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries discuss the Bali roadmap, which sets out emissions reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the Kyoto Protocol.
There is currently a strong debate between industrialised and developing countries.
The United States has already signaled that they do not want to negotiate concrete figures, but they would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 per cent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major question of the conference is whether the industrialised countries are willing to support developing countries, in addition to reducing emissions, both financially and technologically.
An agreement has also been reached on support for developing countries.
The adaptation fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member Council, which is expected to be read in the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as described in the Piac ets Profit.
Hungary's six percent
On behalf of Hungary, Minister for the Environment Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection measures and to achieve a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that by 2020 the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% (measured at 1990 values), whether or not the "accord after 2012" will be successful or not. The Union would even be willing to make a 30% reduction, provided that other major industrialised countries in the world, or developing countries are also willing to fulfil their obligations in terms of strength and responsibility.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the States which had joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 per cent, while the EU had already committed itself to a reduction of 8% with its 15 Member States at the time.
The target for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985-87 - a requirement that the country will fully fulfil, as is to be read in the Ministry of the Environment's press release.
The effort is high on Bali - after all, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly only enter into force after 2012. In this case, the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new international emission reduction system, whose importance has also been highlighted by the IPCC, the International Scientific Committee on Climate Change, with the Nobel Peace Prize, in its recent report.
This would delay the emission reduction, and increasing the average temperature of the earth by more than 2°C would be inevitable, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army throws on YouTube
Units of the British Army have published recordings of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to increase popularity on the video portal.
First of all, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: specialised units stationed in Afghanistan have since March 2006 loaded videos about operations directed against the Taliban, reports the BBC.
The recordings of miniature cameras fixed on helmets are controlled at the Air Force Base in Kandahar and then sent to London where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message inevitable
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under "defense headquarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the international peace forces (MNFI) in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Usage in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and, as the Ministry of Defence says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the public about the actual objectives of foreign operations.
Such propaganda is almost free of charge compared to conventional television advertising, according to Defense Expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain degree of political message as they confirm the right of existence of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
Americans advertise with game
However, the army also has to fight against amateur recordings that, in addition to carefully processed, censored recordings, also create the network - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the highest of the losses are spoken, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
Of the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, many videos have already been loaded on the platform, but this "gattung" has only recently discovered the British for themselves.
The Americans, however, advertise in a somewhat different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "American Army", in which the player can slip into the soldier's skin in the context of a more or less life-saving simulation.
Christmas celebration with Tombola and Pogatsche in the ministries
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth is not at all tricky: instead of a Christmas celebration, she organises a working conference at which her employees can make the year 2007 with coffee and pogatsche.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, other magical Christmas mood with Tombola or jumps into the official hearts.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffet - so the power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already recorded the offices.
The largest Christmas celebration of a Ministry is held in the defence area for a while, but the staff of the Ministry are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas Celebration of the Orphans" children are given by fallen soldiers, at the "Mission Celebration" family members of soldiers currently stationed abroad are hosted, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resource provides about 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other resources, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport are hitting the line.
The 4.32 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economics is held in the house of the future, approximately 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
The focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a Tombola redemption.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration on Wednesday in the House of the State Justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a party.
The room rent was 1 million forint, the rest was spent for the more than 400 guests charged.
According to our information, a NFÜ department is also invited to another Christmas celebration, which is organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
The building of the Lusttheater ("Vígszínház") was rented for the celebration.
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information because we have not reached the responsible.
What's the suit for?
The OIT building was open not only to the guests of the NFÜ, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball instead of a Christmas celebration on December 7.
They did not have to pay the rent to the ILO for the use of the premises.
Around 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech by the Minister, after the dinner there was live music to dance.
At [origo]'s request, it was told: There was no obligation to dress or dress on the ball.
The ministries of health, work, and self-administration prepare each for puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for employees in their own four walls for about 400,000 Forint.
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas party, but to a conference on the year's call.
One expects about 180 guests, who - according to the press department - are hosted only with coffee and pogatsche, the celebration is about 350,000 forint.
Minister of Self-Government Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply attack only in the aula of the Ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas celebration in its own festival hall, to which 436 employees are expected.
The expenditures were measured with 2,500 Forint per head - around this money there is a buffet reception with then jumping.
Since the beginning of the term of office of János Veres, employees of the PM celebrate this way each year.
However, there will not be any proper party ball - not only because of the Minister's official speech, but also because the afternoon party was set up.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites on the 20th of January to a new year reception, and the Christmas celebration of the Ministry will take place this time.
A hundred guests are invited to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget"); according to information from the resort, the expenditure is estimated at 1,000 forints per guest.
According to the press department, it will be a very simple reception, to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be charged.
The receptions that are held every year begin traditionally with a brief speech by the Minister and sound with a slow sham.
As the relevant press stations report on [origo] request, there will be neither a Christmas celebration at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor at the Ministry of Education.
Asked about the cost of Christmas, no information could be given to the press department of the Ministry of the Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests have been invited to celebrate at the Kunstgewerbemuseum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Federation form their coordination committee for the indefinite duration of the strike starting on Monday on Friday.
On Saturday a major protest assembly will be held, on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act - the work starts.
It is expected that there are streak-related, significant traffic barriers, as rail traffic is almost completely discontinued, and the Budapest public transport companies (BKV) are also streaking until 1 p.m.
Details of the strike on Monday will be announced jointly by the League of Trade Unions and the Federation of Trade Unions on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee is also set up, responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a major protest assembly will be held, and from Monday, all the organisations that have joined the strike will put down work for indefinite time, unless agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike on the day of Parliament's vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
However, if the law is adopted, the strike committees will meet to discuss further action.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even possible that there will be a vote on the Health Insurance Act only in the later evening hours, or even at midnight.
The strikes that start on Monday will require significant traffic barriers: the railways will drop their work for indefinite time, the majority of public transport and more than half of Volán's societies are still in the morning.
At the same time, there will be highway blocks in many places in one direction.
The call for strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organisations - the list of participants is updated on the league website.
Some organizations announced strikes at an indefinite time, while others are planning temporary employment.
Until Thursday afternoon, no agreement has been reached between the Hungarian MÁV railway and the Free Trade Union of the VDSZSZ railways, even though there are more and more people travelling by train just around the Christmas Day.
According to previous reports, the BKV is struggling at the start of operation until 1 p.m., at the Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 a.m., the LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat put down the work for four hours, and the teachers' union, e.g. the democratic teachers' union, has called for two or two-hour strikes.
The Hungarian Medical Association, ageing across the country at different times, takes a two-hour warning strike by the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organisation of the SZEF, the Forum for Trade Union Cooperation.
The most important of the four points requested by the League is that the government withdraws the draft reform of health insurance and presents a new concept for social discourse.
The second claim concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
Claim number three is that eligible professional groups will be able to access the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, a member of the League of Trade Unions, has not accepted the offer concerning the sidelines submitted by the Ministry of Transport and now calls for a new approach.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysing Division) of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded in August, with the support of the "Motion for Better Hungary", raised the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
The Institute's Risk Warning Report states, among other things, that, in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "increasing of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Zigeuner and the Non-Zigean population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably aimed at provocating such a conflict, according to the Research Institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure by the political leaders: "Persons of public life have left the discussion of the Roma issue to representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian contrast".
It is assumed that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, promote extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent conflicts.
The Research Institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the domestic and foreign media, "the image of Hungary abroad would have greatly damaged, particularly in terms of confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember: Since autumn 2006, the reorganization of radical and extreme right groups in Hungary has been continuing to rise, so since summer 2007, several organisations called themselves "national self-defense associations" have been established.
"These groups are common to define themselves as a civil organization, while they openly plead to prepare their members for - sometimes armed - defence tasks (civil protection, defence, order-keeping), calling for the inappropriateness of the police, the army or the state itself," it said.
And further: All this is done in accordance with that method, which attempts to shape various political aspirations based on the political and political democracy of the population as a bourgeois initiative.
So the emphasis on the civil character and the form of association are not just the circumvention of legal barriers that could arise in the course of the registration in court - it is at the same time a political strategy.
As the analysis shows, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-enhancing factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been quoted as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, as some ultranationalist politicians in certain neighbouring countries see in the creation of the Hungarian Guard the confirmation of its own anti-Hungarian policy.
All this has an impact on the political stability of the region" - it said.
From the point of view of the Research Institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central-Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are similar to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose establishment was announced in August 2007 by the Right Extreme Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the emergence of the Bulgarian Guard, the Roma mass shouts took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has taken the incidents as an occasion for the establishment of the National Guard, arguing that the aim of the organization of "national protection" is.
In their view, in the past 17 years, a "Zigeuner Terror" in Bulgaria has been felt, but the state remained actless and indifferent - so political capital.
And further, the initiative would have resigned a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic conflicts is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced to set up their own guard for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not possible to exclude that the Hungarian Roma also react to the threats by organizing their own protection, it is stated in the Political Capital Risk Warning Report.
Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news office: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Annual risk analysis reports would be published and, if risk-changing trends are detectable, public opinion will be informed, as in the case of the issue of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere Holidays
In Hungary, holidays are strictly regulated by law, so that the practice of redistributing the working days around the holidays has now been established, but in the coming year we have less such days.
In the EU and in America, one also understands something else as "February Day".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and free working days.
Working-free days are mostly church holidays, or are related to important historical events.
For example, we are also celebrating New Year: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are working-free days - the latter is the only way that the New Year's Celebrations can rest.
Throughout the year we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The state celebrations are the 15th of March, which reminds of the revolution of 1848, and the 23rd of October, the commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20th, the state creation, on May 1st, is celebrated, on November 1 and 2th, we remember our dead.
In addition, there are every two holidays to Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our public, national or religious holidays rarely fall to a weekend, the practice of "working day shift" has proved to be proven in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
However, the price of extended weekends is that we have to work very well on Saturdays before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is finally finalised, the Minister of Labour has for many years been set up in its own regulation.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and workers, public servants and public service officials.
Except only companies and facilities where the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. also on holidays.
It is only the holidays at the end of the year that make the working order a little mess: from 24 December, life remains formal for this purpose, since most of the days between Christmas and New Year's Equilibrium, or take the holidays which have been revoked for it.
Next year, more holidays fall in the middle of the week, or at the end of the week, so that there will be less redispositions in the working days than this year.
The calendar is first placed around the day of work, so that people can stay at home for four days.
Saturday, April 26th will be a working day so that Friday, May 2, can be a rest day.
The second redisposition is related to the holiday on October 23: Saturday, October 18, you will have to finish Friday, October 24.
However, the end of the year will remain in the sign of the holidays, after 24 December everything will be lying and standing, even if New Year's Day falls to a Wednesday.
Six dissuasive little things to irritate colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, language messages that we never receive - harmless lies that we no longer notice: they bring "color" to everyday life at work.
The question is simply whether you get used to these little inconveniences, or you better face the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstanding, consciously for other anxious situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called from the marketing department," says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make it up again by calling the marketing department and confessing that you have forgotten to send the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, it's done with an apology.
Before you get involved in embarrassing excuses, you should consider what is really unpleasant to prepare your colleague for moments and try to consciously avoid these situations.
Loaned something that doesn't belong to yourself?
There's hardly something more nervous than when you grab a document, office accessories, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday, the tape was still on the desk - this morning is it gone?
Or is the lost bullet writer discovered on the desk of a colleague?
Without questions, you should not borrow anything from your colleagues, because they are rightly angry when they find that something has come away.
So, don't put envelopes or post-it out of the office in the bag, because it could hit one itself: no more there if you need it urgently.
What about the private life of the colleagues?
There is no effective way to stop a trash that has already been put into the world.
Who did what with who?
Where and why?
You should not tie the information (or assumptions) about the private life of your colleagues to everyone's nose if possible!
And if someone opens up and tells us his inner secret, we should not misuse this trust!
The best thing to do is to silence like a grave, instead of directing the people who are not present at the moment, even if others also know about the problems of the colleague.
Without reason reported ill?
If you call in the office to report yourself ill in calling for painful headaches, because you just feel uncomfortable, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, uninterrupted work, projects with fixed dates now have to do the colleagues instead of yourself.
So do not play badly to the colleagues!
If one already knows that one will not get into the office the next day, or that something could come between, which is why one needs to stay at home, one should report it in time so that neither colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Total, Gekicher, Telephone
One is just deepened in his work, but is suddenly disturbed by the noise of the colleagues?
Unwillingly heard a phone call that you shouldn't have heard?
You should not nerve colleagues with summing, singing, loud conversations (which you run over their heads), trample, lasting snorkeling or nörgels.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not just deepened in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are the others always blamed?
If a project is not completed in time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, you should not look for the guilt of your own negligence from others!
If possible, you should not talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
The best way to acknowledge your mistakes is to apologize if others were affected!
The question of how to correct the mistake, or how to retrieve the failure, is just too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Training panties and sleeves: Comfortable for home, but has not lost anything in the office!
Not even then you should dress so empty if it actually allowed the job!
Don't just become silly - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to the extent that you dress in the office accordingly - if desired, you should also be nice and elegant!
To make it right to everyone - or how do you become uninteresting for others
Stop and go-road, the car in the middle of the morning's stash.
From the radio sounds a strange melody: The sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I'll turn the volume up.
The pace changes, to the previous sounds the bass comes, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It's the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar that sounds like mr2.
For a long time, the local music scene has not just wasted us with qualitative electropop.
But now you even see the stau different when you hear the new album of Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, a number of new and exciting productions from the domestic digital underground scene slowly contribute to a change in the overall image, and even if the garage rock is "in" with its guitar gear again, the domestic electropop proves: There is something new under the sun.
Baláz's Zságer started to play in Pécs even in the Yonderboi band before he began to walk his own way - perhaps because a host doesn't hold two peppers.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which merged elements from jazz, electronic, and pop, he did not create until when the request to compose the soundtrack into a film had joined him (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which had initially occurred in smaller clubs, was not known to the wider audience until the magazine "wan2" travelled its first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, became almost the only trend seter that was marketable even in the West.
Zagar and his band "trendy" were undoubtedly, but no one was interested if they liked to wear this brand.
The band reacted to how it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album now published with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open new paths to them, but already the title expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression comes from the time Balázs Zságer was still on his way with another band.
The airy, flying hint would also be fine, but besides the essential character of music the louder guitar, which corresponds to the temporal spirit and trends, the influences of Rock'n'Roll.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, living in England and working with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the premiere in Millenáris.
A song of the album even made it to the radio striker - the mr2 Petőfi, who has sent pop music from early to late, has put the earworm on the listeners with the number "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six domestic singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything's okay (?).
The hvg.hu asked at Baláz's Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Baláz's Zságer: The term "skill music" doesn't mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercially and honestly.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be sunny and nonsense, but they can also be produced only for the sale, which makes them commercial music.
A good pop number can also arise from an honest motive.
The listener's willingness to accept works independently of languages and national borders, according to this principle.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and the foreign audience of your music?
B. Zs.: In abroad, especially in the west of us, pop music has a larger tradition.
Not only teenagers or Twens go to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that happen around them much more attentive, because they also consider them to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important to who, where, how many people hear your music?
B. Zs.: Of course, it is a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.
But we never composed for the market.
With us, the music is not born to serve a purpose, but for a particular reason.
The role of the audience is usually noticeable at the concerts, where there is already mutual interaction, but they are only available in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
Yet I noticed one thing: If you want to make it right to everyone, you're no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on his way as a soloist and has built his career more in the West.
B. Zs.: We don't really go his way, once and for all, apart from the fact that one is always trying to interpret this into our music.
We see each other as a team player who trusts the musical presence of the other and lets them develop.
At the beginning, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came out of his band and took another way.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petőfi "Wings of Love" stands first.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening consciously staged with a slightly more popular style towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit, which should then hold as a train horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was thought as the final of the album with which we wanted to solve the soundorgie and the more difficult themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why it, what was the guideline?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of assembling the choir from talented soloists of the domestic music scene.
So the six-headed choir was born - so Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we later baptized "Underground Divas".
Hvg.hu: Did you want to have the song the same, or did the girls make it?
B. Zs.: The number was in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material was ready for the album, we thought that this number needed "something else".
The sequence of the agreement formally called for a voice of vocals.
I sung the melody the same night, and later they learned the girls.
Everything came practically forward and terrifyingly spontaneously.
I remember, I was pretty electric at that time, but it needed the "Divas" too.
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, however, they had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo party (apart from Judy Jay's short solo), they don't have their own role, singing perfectly together and are not louder than the music, so their singing is not only accompanied by the music.
Also on the stage they stood behind.
Is it intentional?
B.Z.: The fact that they were standing behind was so because of purely technical problems.
However, we would not consciously allow them to get solo rolls.
In the number, it is also about forgetting your ego a little, forgetting who came from where and where to go, let us just let these certain wings, the wings of love raise us.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song came up with.
Hvg.hu: Which was the most expensive song?
B. Zs.: In the musical work, there has been more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, in "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", in which I play on a concert keyboard, or in "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the Groove didn't want to work anymore, but gradually everything has been merged together, like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which is your favorite number from the new album?
B. Zs.: This changes continuously with the concerts and also now that I have "lost" the album.
Currently it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Deceiving brokers risked billions because of feelings of inferiority
Landless frauder
Thus, his former employee Jerome Kerviel denotes the French banking giant Société Générale, the owner of the local Komerční banka.
It came by almost five billion euros for his sake.
It seems, however, that Kerviel was only a big player who wanted to do it immediately to his colleagues, and was certainly not incompetent.
Unlike all large bank houses, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in time.
"He's rather mentally weak," was heard from the mouth of his superiors who showed him to the police.
However, as the statements of Kerviels, published by the French media, for example the newspaper Le Monde, showed, he was a person who, at the end of last year, had won 1.6 billion euros with his business.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he claims in his statement.
In the summer he had succeeded in earning half a billion euros in the American crisis.
He had already hoped to do so at the beginning of the year.
In February, the first news was that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as low-income customers or those who had previously had problems with payment, would be in trouble.
But this crisis should not have an impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe that and kept right.
At the end of the year he had raised his profit up to 1.6 billion euros.
"As soon as I earned the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain that," Kerviel admits and continues to say that he definitely kept nothing for himself.
During the whole interrogation, he admits that he faked documents so that he could not be found on the shaft.
He even managed to lead his bosses behind the light, even though the Eurex Exchange gradually became interested in his business.
Profit risk
Was he afraid of flying up?
I don't think so.
"I thought she satisfied the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank."
How did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to gradually develop his position.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he would never earn as much as others.
"Just at my first conversation in 2005 I knew that I was observed.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel explained to the investigators.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
With the shares of the Alliance, he earned a lot by placing half a billion euros in the London bombings on the price losses of this title.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you win, let us let you
"This is like a snowball," he said to the police.
But the bosses were supposed to know about everything, or they thought about it.
"As long as I earned money, you close your eyes."
But then the big blow came at the beginning of this year.
On a single day he lost a billion euros.
At a weekend in mid-January he wanted to compensate for this.
When he arrived at work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the Bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it lost five billion euros for his sake.
And how did they get to him?
He was suspicious of a vacation.
"I have only taken four days from the previous year.
A broker who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want to see him in the cards," Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has the chance to reach 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, which will enable the Czech Republic to reach EUR 14 billion (approximately SEK 365 billion) in the coming years.
It is about half of the sum that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the period 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive approximately 100 billion kronor from the "Company and Innovation" programme.
Most money, about 150 billion, will flow into transport expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22% of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money increases in line with the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have 90.8 billion next year.
The "Company and Innovation" programme is intended to help entrepreneurs and businesses gain funds for innovative enterprises.
This will help companies gain funding for the introduction of new technologies, for corporate research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful in the current acquisition of money from EU funds among the new candidate countries.
Nicaraguan court confirms twenty-year imprisonment for ex-presidents
On Thursday, an appeal court in Nicaragua confirmed the twentieth year imprisonment for former President Arnold Alemán, to which he had been sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of $100 million (almost $1.8 billion).
Later, however, he had been released from prison and lived under house arrest on his Hazienda at the Nicaraguan metropolis.
According to the AP news agency, it is currently unclear whether the former Head of State (1997 to 2002) of this Central American State is back behind the grid.
According to the president of the Appeal Court, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the detainees whether Alemán is allowed to go home or whether he has to go to prison.
Four years ago, a court pointed out that Alemán had regularly transferred government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictive and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money finally landed in a fund established by Alemán to finance his election campaign in 2001.
The budget is:
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget drafted by this government and adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
The current year was still approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because Minister Sobotka (by this party) had presented it to him, and the ČSSD was therefore unable to allow himself to reject it.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government, nothing dramatically happened this time.
The House approved this traditionally low-respected, yet highly important law in peace.
This is, in some way, paradoxical.
All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether it pleases or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is concealed by the government's power struggle and the opposition.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, and therefore they pay more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting for the public than numb numbers.
The government budgets suffered from three weaknesses in the past social-democratic governments, which cannot be eliminated at once by the budget for 2008:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure that is required by law, not only in the case of pensions, but also in the case of social expenditures, which the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (Communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is the deficiency of budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third restriction is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of municipalities.
However, the greatest risk is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is public and somehow under control.
A real time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to revenue from taxes, levies and bank credits, have often spent unreasonably on debt securities that they owed their council halls excessively.
In recent years, they have managed to pay these debts through massive sale of shares of energy and other supply networks that they had received from the State during the privatisation process.
Now this source is already dotted.
Insofar as we only maintain official and verifiable facts, we find that:
our economy has been undergoing a growth phase for a few years, like the rest of the world, whose ČSSD is praised without neglect.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to correct public finances.
Instead, these governments owed the state even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have been much more reasonable than our Republic.
This is a huge shame, which is mainly due to the former governments.
We are among the countries that, globally speaking, are least threatened by poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes which, unfortunately, have been completely unnecessaryly blown up in recent years.
Although it has succeeded in removing some of the insane populist expenditures that were adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if it does not come to a postponement of the retirement age and to a pension reform in the near future, virtually any policy in this country will end, and no matter whoever is in power, it will remain to him as a pure administration.
It is only easy to exaggerate when it is said that then from ruling politicians will become officials who mechanically divide the majority of tax revenues into pensions and social expenditure.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the banning of normal expenditure through compulsory expenditure.
The planned deficit of 70 billion kronor for 2008 would be superfluous if previous governments had not spent over the last ten years, which was just going on.
If we don't want it to come from ruling politicians to become pure administrative officials, then we have to be patient and this not too strong coalition government, who is aware that the state can only spend as much as it is able to take on taxes and fees to wish rest in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these will enable the progressive implementation of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to deal with crisis
The American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to fight the crisis in the financial markets together.
For example, more than $100 billion will come through auctions to the currency markets.
On these auctions, banks auction interest rates for which they are willing to borrow mutual money.
For example, the American Fed sends $40 billion to auction, another 24 makes it easy for the European and Swiss Central Bank.
After the attacks of 11 September, it is the first time that the central banks of each country agree on such a coordinated approach to the defence or mitigation of the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is intended to eliminate the greatest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of freely available capital that banks can provide," wrote Bernard Baumohl, a customer report from the consulting company Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated action of the central banks has reduced the probability of a recession in the United States from 65% to about 50%," added Baumehl in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion because of unused loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions of losses.
"The central banks must have been really afraid of what can still be done when they decided to do this," said the Chief Economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
The central banks fear that if banks themselves have hard access to bonds, credits will also be more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption, and the American economy would fall into a recession, possibly with an impact on economic growth around the world.
The central banks decided to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate used in the lease between banks.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to borrow each other money, even though the banks of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom had lowered their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as another reduction in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio by Tempus Consulting of the Reuters agency.
Some analysts believe that this step of central banks contributes to warming up the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the United States.
Klaus: The debates of the ecologists are unbelievable
Global climate change is supposed to be most harmful to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again spoke about the problem of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the close of the UN International Conference on Climate Change on Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A blue, not green planet", he explained that the debates of the ecologists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only the structure of the conference is unacceptable, which constitutes a strange mixture of government representatives and such of non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric it accompanies and the reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word firework that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," Klaus said.
In presenting his book, the Czech President stressed that his topic was very important to him and that he was so engaging in this.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation, because "I often encounter cartoons of my views."
So now interested parties could read his attitude undistortedly.
Klaus reminded that he was not a climatetologist, but he felt he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
Finally, he is academic, capable of understanding and assessing technical treatments, has experience with statistics and is also a national economist.
As the main expression of the book, he described the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consistent opinion among the scientists on global warming that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and thus no threat, and that efforts to influence the development of the climate are supernecessary, ineffective and unacceptable.
In addition, he considers that it is unacceptable, as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems, to impose other unproven views, that he considers this to be a dangerous restriction on freedom.
On questions from attendees, he repeatedly stated that he was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who did not take into account the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus had talked about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600000 people failed to exchange their driver's license
600000 drivers failed to exchange their old driver's licence, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when you can apply for the exchange so that the authorities can make it possible to issue a new driver's license by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not fear that hundreds of thousands of riders will travel on the roads after the new year without a valid driving licence.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive have not changed their driving licence.
While small places report a strong decline in interest in the exchange of tickets, the offices of the capital are overshadowed with requests, and the interest in exchange grew this week.
The city administration produces around 2000 customers daily.
You have to stand about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driving licence.
The exhibition takes a new driver's license for 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shortened period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Drivers who do not create the required exchange by the end of the year and start driving without a valid driver's license will be subject to a penalty from January.
The offender pays a maximum of 2000 crowns.
However, the police can also make it use of a reminder in the event of a violation.
In the event of a breach, the penalty may rise to 2500 crowns.
According to earlier information, the community can also impose a penalty on the person who does not drive at all.
He could, as it was said, threaten a penalty of even 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry already called on the offices to let mildness prevail and impose a maximum penalty of 1,000 crowns.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one threatens a thousand crown sentence.
The driving licence is a document in which everyone can decide whether to own it or not.
It is not a identity card that everyone must have, and that is a valid one.
People who don't want to drive should issue their driver's license.
It is sufficient to bring him to the competent municipality office or to send him there by letter.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will be invalidated.
However, the drivers must gradually also exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 have three years to exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued in 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more driving licences.
Court reduces penalties for detectives associated with Berdych
The former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko.a.k, who are accused of having done a joint thing with the bands of David Berdych, received 13 or 10 years of imprisonment.
This was decided by the Prague Oberlandesgericht in a legal judgment, which reduced its penalty by one or two years.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for the Combat of Organized Crime" threatened 14 or 12 years.
There is no possibility of appeal against today's judgment, only a revision of the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also accused in this case, but he is first facing the first instance judgment.
In other cases, however, he had already been punished for a total of 16 years.
He can't be convicted too much.
In January, a district court held 19 persons guilty, mainly for participation in robbery, and today the Oberlandesgericht negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most accused disputed the charge from the beginning with the reason that it was a constructed case.
According to the Middle Bohemian District Court, police members in agreement with, among other things, Berdych criminals handed out information from police sources, covered various robbery and helped members of the gangs to escape the prosecution.
The bands left Opava and Ko.
The accusation is about gang crimes from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robberies, whose victims often suffered serious injuries, but also the accusation of office and illegal possession of weapons.
During house searches, the police discovered illegal guns, ammunition with steel cores, a laser target telescope and a machine gun.
According to the charges, the bands have enriched many million crowns by their robbery.
In addition to almost 20 men in this proceedings, tribunals recognized Berdych and a number of others as guilty for further robbery.
Other men from Berdych's circle have to be responsible for another trial; other cases have not yet been brought before the court.
To date, the main proceedings have been evaded in Irish detention and are pending the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children exchanged - invoice: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a childbirth clinic, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to claim compensation from the hospital in Třebe for 12 million kronor plus court costs.
For each of the mothers each three million, for the fathers each two million and for the children each one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent couple.
The representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, therefore totally disagrees with the Velebas proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is too high," said Dostál after today's negotiation.
"But in order to give us an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the opinion that allowed the counter-proposal to be prepared.
We will see if it has any meaning.
We insist, however, that this should be in the hundreds of thousands of years for all together," said Dostál.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
At the beginning, the family from Jabloğov wanted a million crowns for every month that she had not raised her biological daughter.
Veleba served as the basis for compensation negotiations as an opinion prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
The parents of the children suffered mental damage and stress symptoms in different strengths and depths, according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry.
The men better handled the stress situation, even if they saw themselves accusations that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborn.
The women, in turn, deal worse with the aftereffects of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is going on now, Veleba merged the content.
On December 9, Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses from the birth clinic in Třeb.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jablo.
At the end of October, the district head of Vysočina (Bohemian-Moric Highness) gave each family 100000 crowns as a replacement for expenses incurred by the hospital in Třeb.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law for liability.
In case of doubt, they have to access a reserve fund, only exceptionally they can apply for assistance from the institution.
The courts have so far agreed to relatively low amounts of damages, the amounts have been determined by tables and have moved in the range of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka came around his kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute about the brand "Royal Kingdom of Walachei".
According to the judge at the District Court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the name "Walachian King", but the project had built up a team around Thomas Harabiš in collaboration with the actor for many years.
Polívka did not take part in the hearing today.
According to his lawyer, however, the matter is probably not finished and his client will probably appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate parasitically in the popularity of Bolek Polívka," said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
All of them present themselves in the words "Walachian Kingdom" to these actors and comics.
The same opinion is also Harabiš.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
"Building money and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the cause of a dispute is for money.
"After years, they have noticed that the project is successful and that they could also have some of it.
They want to win parasitic in our work," he continued.
Lukrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the name "Walach King" for the first time in one of his television broadcasts.
In 1993, he was crowned by the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
But that was not related to the purpose of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later Harabiš came to the idea of spending Walachian passports.
From an original fun action, a business and entrepreneurial activity were crystallized, and Harabiš then joined the establishment of the company "Walachian Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and signature in the passports and even offered its owners discounts when visiting his farm and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today the judge also argued that Harabiš used only the mere idea that Polívka had made public in the "Manege" program for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"The popularity of Polívkas has certainly helped the project of the Walach Kingdom," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the Harabiš project and his team were intensely dedicated to it.
The cooperation of today's disputed parties lasted until 2000, when Harabiš organized the official crowning for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, between Polívka and Harabiš began to accumulate the disputes that peaked in the deposition of King Boleslavs I. until the Saint Nimmerlin's Day.
The leadership role then took on the initiative of Harabišs Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed the complaint against Harabiš and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clarity in the dispute could bring the race prepared by Harabiš around the throne and half the princess.
A new king should come out of this.
Details and a date he didn't want to tell.
"We don't want to hurry.
It should be something like the king's move in the Walachei.
The king should be chosen for a certain time.
Mr. Polívka can also register quietly," added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Prefabricated parts disappear
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving properties were not much worth, the quality of the switch, the steering and also the processing could be described as rather less than average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and it is much better.
The combi with the name SW is a bit further, and I only have to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the 207, I had to complain, for example, about the low headlessness on the back seats.
These complaints are no longer available, because the body of the combi is designed so that not even two-metre men will suffer.
Continue fast
I'm just going through the interior for a moment, not to repeat too much.
It is a rather successful design, where I have only objections about the worrying middle tunnel.
There I would welcome a little more designer design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and are over the times when we may complain about short seats or headrests.
Side content has also improved significantly compared to 206.
As far as space is concerned, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the body.
In the combi, the already mentioned lack of head freedom is also eliminated.
Luggage in the luggage room
But the main thing about this car is the loading room.
I have to call it very well loadable and space-saving (also because of the folding back window).
The hollow rooms are equipped with straps that represent an ideal compromise.
They do not interfere, they can be distracted, and they also hold more heavy objects.
But let's talk about the load volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment, it is 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared to competition.
However, not compared to the vehicle most sold in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
By comparing the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot remains clearly visible by 52 litres.
This value is already critical for a holiday abroad or when a child car is invited.
But in order to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the very flat load space after switching the back seats or the very low loading edge.
120 PS in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a cylinder capacity of 1.6 litres and an output of 88 kWp.
And honestly, it should look like a 1600-cubic engine that drives a family hatchback.
It is quiet, has a low consumption and moves well away.
If I compare him with his counterpart at Škoda, which sometimes seems like his exhaust was blocked with a lap, then I can only be excited by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not very popular.
We must remember, however, that we have tested a well equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine amounting to 329900 crowns is still at stake.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot.
The premium equipment of the test car once again beats with 80,000 crowns in addition to bays.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic disk wiper trigger, electric window lifts back and...
Thus the car costs a total of 531900 crowns.
That's a lot, but count the additional equipment of a Fabia together and you'll arrive at a very similar amount.
So only the decision remains to choose which brand you want to choose.
Failure to integrate Slovak students in British schools
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern Europe is increasing, causing local fears of the further development of local schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has hitherto encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where conflicts between immigrants and children of the original inhabitants are increasing in violence.
The problem of integrating children from Eastern Europe into British schools illustrates the case of North Kent, where the conflicts between local and Slovak immigrants gradually increase.
Disputes, shakes and robbery among students have transferred to the relationships between parents.
The situation has evolved so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron stack.
The defendant defended himself with the boy insulted her with racist insults.
The police also had to intervene on a Slovak immigrant after an attack by two minor girls.
The girls had allegedly made racist comments to the man and thrown him with stones.
"When we went home, a boy climbed on a Bush noise and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw us with apples and pears, and then blew his sausage," a mother of Slovak students of the newspaper The Times described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the dispute with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a survival struggle.
The cases mentioned show that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is increasing.
In the UK, 70,000 Slovakians have been reported to come here for job search.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students thus visit British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, that will come true if you only choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet as a pond.
Palms and All Inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and disturbing cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you can find this to an abundant extent.
But only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye ever saw.
Havana once became a camp or transit camp of treasures that the Spanish had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
Hotel Nacional was born at the end of the 20th century.
Built it was one of the heads of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered to be a crime in the United States (especially during the ban), was enjoyed and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among others:
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, highlands grew, cars traveling across the broad boulevards, which were one of the culte symbols of the 1950s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his hunt.
Stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar at Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails as desired for you.
And the cult cars of the 1950s are driving around in Havana until today, because the once imported Schigulis and Fiats in the salty and humid air have long broken apart.
May Havana, especially its oldest part, have fallen strongly, nowhere can you find as many wonderful colonial sights in the surroundings as just here.
Other places are just being cast out, for example Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism brings urgently needed money, there was green light for this development.
In the past fifteen years, new hotels have not only emerged in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and on islands like Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a marotte that is unique in the world and especially attracts rail lovers.
The sugar tube of remote plantations brought steam and the same driven smelter tracks to the sugar mills.
Their vehicle park has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see clean and fully functioning locomotives there, whose fellows of age are long in the museum elsewhere.
Destinations
The most important places do not leave the majority of Cuban visitors.
So you don't have to write more detail about Varadero or Havana.
Just to mention that there is a museum in the property Hemingways mentioned above, whose visit should not be missed by anyone who likes this writer.
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of Cuba's most picturesque angles.
The lush vegetation grows on the lime floor.
The mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, steeply up from the valley floor, in their hollows, gathering fertile soils, through which also warned rock areas are covered by dense growth.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form you can meet him when you visit one of the Cigarry Factories of Havana.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean series "Major Zeman" was played there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Rumor and wealth brought her the trade with slaves and sugar.
The richness embodied itself in the beautiful beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountains, is a place so remote that there was still no road in the 1950s of the last century that would have connected the area to the rest of the country.
This insulation helped to ignore it.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was cut off, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, it is worth seeing interesting places in the area, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the Valley of Sugar Factories.
In the evening you should then go to the Casa de la Música, which lives after the darkness, and where the music does not silence until the morning.
Baracoa
This small town in the east of Cuba some call it the most beautiful of the island.
Surely this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads leading from Guantánamo there must overcome high and ventilated mountains and run through a landscape that is hardly touched by human interventions.
This eastern preposter Cuba included UNESCO in its World Heritage Directory thanks to its unaffected nature.
There is the best chocolate made, the church shows the cross of Columbus (in reality it was created about a hundred years after the trips of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the current Hotel El Castillo, stands, there are several mountains of table, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the room, the cigars, the Sierra-Maestra mountains, the bay of pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves confess, could be written on many pages.
But, as you say, look better with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, claim Americans.
According to the United States, too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should draw up a concrete plan for the next few years, according to the words of Defense Minister Robert Gates.
The mission in Afghanistan did not run according to its ideas, and in Scotland, the representatives of the countries that had stationed units in the south of the country agreed on this.
In addition to the increasing resistance of the Taliban, the eight participating States also discuss further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its defence minister Robert Gates, called on NATO units to have more activity, the UK sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in strengthening development aid.
"In Afghanistan, progress is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to allow the inhabitants to start economic and security development themselves," says the British Minister of Defence, Des Browne of the BBC.
Ninety percent
According to the U.S. army, the activity of the Afghan rebels has reached the highest level for five years.
The number of violences has increased by 27 per cent compared to the previous year, and in the southern province of Helmand by even 60 per cent.
NATO countries have stationed approximately 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, of which about one quarter in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached an absolute limit on the organization and equipment of the units.
In concrete terms, they require further helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
"We will seriously have to think about the concrete goals for the next time and how we can achieve them," Gates said.
The Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, said similarly today.
"I am not pleased with what we have available in Afghanistan to land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little," said De Hoop of the Reuters agency to conclude three-day discussions with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is Passive
There has also been a dispute among the participating countries in recent months about whether all all allies in Afghanistan will do their best.
For example, Germany has been criticised because of passiveness.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country," Gates said.
This week, the British boulevard newspaper "Sun" described the German soldiers as faulpelze.
"Afghanic nonstubers depicted: Germans play games while our boys fight," the "Sun" wrote in a post supplemented by photos of German soldiers, playing table tennis.
The German image magazine went over to counter-attack and printed a picture of a British unit during a Rugby competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Government debts will be high-speed to a billion in 2009
Each Czech Republic has a government debt of 84,000 kronor.
The total debt rose to 842,7 billion kronor by the end of September.
The government had planned to owe itself this year with 159.2 billion kings.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the improved development of government budgetary policy.
The Czech Republic's government debt increased to 842,7 billion kronor by the end of September.
As a result, within the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
However, since June they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its information on government debts from early October.
Each Czech Republic bears a debt of 84,000 crowns.
Over the whole year, the government owed more than 111 billion kronor.
"Thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, it seems that we may only exceed the limit of a billion crowns in 2009.
Next year, debts were expected to move between 900 billion and a billion kronor," said David Marek, analyst of Patria Finance, server iHNed.cz.
Likewise, Vladimír Pikora, Analyst of Next Finance, sees: "We could come to exceed a billion in 2009.
When exactly depends on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If the situation on the political stage should be shown to change, and politicians should be willing to save more, it could take until 2010.
But I do not expect such a change," he noted.
Debt growth
The government debt is due to the government's debts and is mainly due to the accumulation of government budget deficits.
The government debt is financed by tax instructions, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, bonds from the European Investment Bank.
National government debt has now risen to 719.4 billion kronor this year.
The government's foreign debt has now risen by 1.7 billion kronor to 123.3 billion kronor.
The so-called marketable government debt reached SEK 803.3 billion at the end of September and fell by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of government debt increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased by 13 per cent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really much in view of how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting that growth is seen especially in debt securities, where the increase is 20%.
It is bad that debts are rising, but on the other hand this shows that you can do something even before the pension reform comes," Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The funding strategy and the management of government debt for 2007 show that the government had planned for this year to absorb SEK 159.2 billion.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to SEK 152.8 billion thanks to the improved development of public budget policy.
This amount is mainly due to the government budget deficit, which will obviously reach 76 billion kronor this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion kronor.
It is also a maximum set-aside for the consolidation agency of SEK 13.3 billion, a ten-billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of government bonds for 43 billion, and rates for bonds to the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion.
For giving a name to a Teddy bear, she was presented to a court in Khartum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher who had been accused of insulting Islam in Sudan was sentenced to 15 days of detention and subsequent expulsion by a court in Khartum on Thursday night.
The British was accused of having allowed six- to seven-year-old students to give a Teddy bear the name of Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
She would have deserved to be spoiled.
After several complaints by the parents of students at the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old primary school teacher, who worked at the Unity High School of Khartum, was taken home at home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code.
In fact, this matter takes its start in September when the teacher invites her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class centeddy.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, says school manager Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class vote, 20 out of 23 children Mohammed choose as the favourite forenames.
Of course, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic Prophet, but above all also a very common first name in Sudan.
Then the children have created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the image signature My name is Mohammed .
The bear himself wore no sign with that name, but the problem is quite simple that the representation of the Islamic prophet is considered as an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who taught at the same school in Sudan, said he knew them well, and she would never have done anything that could bring her to a religious belief, I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, he thought it was just an innocent mistake.
An opinion that shares numerous students of the teacher who describe them as very attentive to their students and as a person who never speaks about religion in the class.
It is remembered that at the same time the first name Mohammed is also the second most common name given in the UK, for which 14 different writing methods exist in English.
This forename often chosen by Muslim families is considered to be a kind of honor to the prophet (it is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
For example, can one give him a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, no agreement was reached at the last negotiating meeting in Vienna on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Kosovo Serbs and Albanians ended a sixth and last discussion meeting on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their controversies about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties were unable to reach agreement on the status , said the European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
With emphasis on the fact that peace in the region is at stake, its American counterpart Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina urged to comply with their obligations to maintain peace and to continue the discussions beyond the end of the negotiations.
No violence is expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added and indicated that there are quite clear tensions.
End of the conciliations on 10 December
The Troika mediators that unite the European Union, the USA and Russia will meet for the last time on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province, inhabited to 90% of Albanian speaking, could be clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiating meeting since the Troika had been commissioned by the United Nations for a new conciliation last August.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation mandate to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked the consent of Kosovo's independence to the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this end date.
Russia was and continues to advocate a negotiated solution, an agreed solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
One-sided Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of Kosovo being under UN administration, the Western countries consider independence under EU supervision to be the only solution with the future.
Pristina is willing to declare it unilaterally if the Security Council should not decide in favour of it.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached," announced the President of the Autonomous Authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations have been held the last chance since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovon rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, shared his regrets.
He added, however, that the plan proposed by Belgrade belongs to the autonomy of a past which has led to murders and deportations.
Domino Effect
On the other hand, Serbian President Boris Tradic felt that a compromise was always to be achieved, and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly anticipating a "domino effect" in a region that is still so weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision should be taken only in the Security Council, where their Russian allies have a veto right.
The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word
Only a decision from the Security Council's ranks is acceptable to Serbia,” said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end as they started: in the Security Council.
To the journalists Fatmir Sejdiu replied that the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status, and added that every unilateral declaration of independence from the Albanian speaking population will take place in agreement with the Western countries.
Bush unlocks an agreement between Israel and Palestinians
At the opening of the International Peace Conference, which had gathered under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israel and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas agreed to start negotiations immediately in order to find a definitive settlement of 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men Bush promised that he would do everything to help them to conclude a peace agreement before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructure and Israel must stop its colonization work, Bush said, reminding the two parties of their commitments with regard to the roadmap for peace which they had agreed to in 2003.
The Head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority under Abbas ultimately seek a peace treaty to clarify all open issues without exception, including the central issues.
This name includes the three serious problems that are mainly related to the conflicts between Israel and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees who were expelled from their homeland in the state of Israel today in the course of the 1948 conflict.
According to the American President, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the forthcoming negotiations should be conducted comprehensively and thoroughly and provide a solution for all issues, including Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water and security.
When Olmert, for his part, took the floor, he committed himself to conducting the forthcoming cease-fire negotiations directly and without interruption and to strive to ensure that they could be terminated before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for implementing his vision of two States, a Palestinian and an Israeli, which exist alongside each other, for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has disclosed that Bush has received a guarantee in this sense before it decides to participate in the conference.
Arabs, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, have launched a plan adopted by all Arab countries, offering Israel peace, in exchange for their withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a breakthrough in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attackes the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, the Saudi-Arab Prince in his interview with the Arab-speaking newspaper financed by Saudi funds.
In the opinion of the Attorney General, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumours are facing themselves.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation by the National Disciplinary Authority of the Police (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 5:00 a.m., a police car was driving on the Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no use, but was on track, and drove with 40-50 km/h, without blue light , explains a police speaker.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, without authorisation, so not released for public road transport (see below), came, controlled by two young people without helmets, driven at very high speed.
It fell the left side of the police car after it had ignored its advance from the right, a police officer further explained.
Alcohol control carried out in the case of vehicle passengers is very negative.
The condition of the car (scattered wing, broken windscreen, cut-off stack) proves the stubbornness of the impact.
Very quickly, already yesterday morning, the Attorney-General of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation on "the facts of the involuntary murder and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in consultation with Val-d'Oise's Head of Public Security.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the Attorney of State stated that she excluded the responsibility of the police at this stage of investigation of the IGPN.
According to the Magistrate, three witnesses of the accident who were heard Sunday evening have confirmed the version of the police, namely that this small motorcycle has arrived relatively quickly on their left side.
Yesterday, a kind of rifle, certainly caused by friction of the footrests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had remained hooked up until the police managed to brake it.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to a technical review.
The body names of the two victims were obducted yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor quickly made the round that the police would have left the place of the accident very quickly, without providing help to the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also exclude this matter from any serious error.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigation for which further investigations are needed and which needs to be carried out very carefully.
Libération has met an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had direct views of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her again, this witness tells.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed policeman who went behind.
Two more tried to revive one of the young people who telephoned the fourth.
In the light of the tension that had quickly arisen around the event and, as it seems, because of the certainty that the present persons had about the unexpected situation of young people, the police officers of colleagues who arrived at the accident site were taken with them in the car.
According to this testimony, the rescue forces arrived about twenty minutes after the police left.
They also used heart massages, but for nothing.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police forces did not help young people.
These young people were first helped.
The firefighter came immediately.
It was done everything in order to try to save her, emphasised the attorney-in-law.
In Pakistan, tension increases
On Monday, the Pakistani police defeated the first demonstrations, since two days before General Musharraf had declared an emergency.
According to witnesses, in the city of Lahore, in the eastern part of the country, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the measures taken in the context of the emergency, had been injured by the tear gas grenades that deployed the ordering forces there.
They then threw them with stones with which they wounded the police.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested temporarily.
Similar scenarios existed in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several would have been arrested temporarily.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of oppositionals, defenders of human rights and lawyers during the weekend.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations would have been found in Multan (middle) and Peshawar (northeast).
On Monday, the lawyer movement received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful alliance Buthida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president urged the people to send flowers to the judges who had spoken against the emergency, and to the waste that had made an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf’s promise no longer applies
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced Saturday evening.
In the following days he had to take a position on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct election on 6 October.
The President of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was revoked and revoked.
All we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, declared the Magistrate of the News newspaper.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to give the supreme command over the army and to become a civilian president is no longer valid since the call for the emergency, said Tariq Azeem on Monday, Deputy Minister for Information.
It was expected that he would issue his military uniform until November 15th, the date on which his first term of office as President ends.
The Deputy Minister for Information has also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denounced the rumours of persistence in the country, according to which President Musharraf would have been assigned a place of residence by his deputy military leader.
More than one third of pregnancy is still not planned
This calculation takes into account the undesirable pregnancy (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unexpected births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one of three pregnancy (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account the undesirable pregnancy (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unexpected births.
The Ined estimates that the various contraception methods such as the pill or the spiral still have a 5-6% failure rate.
According to the Institute, which finds that the percentage of pill users between 20 and 40 years of age who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, however, the liberalisation of contraception has enabled a better control of fertility.
In any case, eight out of ten births are planned carefully today.
For one of five couples even calculated accurately on the month, and, if possible, in the spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the occupation of the International Space Station (ISS) will have taken more than seven hours in space to carry out the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector that is essential for the continuation of the scientific work at the station.
A daring exit, which, due to its duration, the removal of inhabitable modules, the speed with which he was organized, and the astronaut-basted tools to carry out the repair, has achieved several records.
The problem occurred on Wednesday when the astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery spacefare, a large cylindrical part that would soon take up the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratory.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to implement a 17.5 tons heavy module for power generation via solar collectors already on the ISS to bring it into its final position.
After moving it, the crew began to restructure the solar collectors of the module, whose range is 76 metres.
And it happened that one of the collectors that can be folded like an accordion was damaged by a clamped cable on a length of about one meter
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector any more.
The astronauts who originally left Discovery for a checkout and then repaired another solar collector whose rotation system was defective were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was selected to walk around at the end of the 30 meters long remote arm of the spacefare, which had been installed at the station, to do the repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skilled, he has a well developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old trained doctor was therefore chosen to operate the wounded solar collector.
After having carefully evaluated the damage, he separated the faulty cable and fixed a kind of rail on the damaged site.
He was supported by a second spacewalker who stayed near the lock, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool that he used, a mini hockey rack, wrapped with insulator to prevent an electric blow on the solar collectors that produce several hundred volts, had the astronauts on board the station invented and bazed.
When the action was finished, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully folded before he counted his tools and returned to the station.
Last afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day's relaxation before today seven astronauts returned to Discovery's spacefare to arrive on Wednesday's flight back to Earth.
The title EADS on the stock exchange sanctioned
After the Aviation and Defence Group announced that it will have to spend between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion in order to counter the residues of the A400M, the EADS stock currently shows a significant decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007 with reference to the residues caused by the slowly progressing development of the A400M engine, which delay the aircraft's Jungfernflug.
The costs announced in October to offset the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft amount to between EUR 1.2 and 1.4 billion, of which more than one billion for Airbus, announced by the parent group of the European manufacturer EADS.
As a result of these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operational performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results, without further details.
The Group also states that the assessment of the new costs is linked to the six-month delay.
As a reminder, EADS’ operating performance fell from 86% in 2006, mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, the very large carrier aircraft A380.
Originally, the group had planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The Choice of Status Quo
On Sunday it will not be exciting when counting the urns: the mass of Russians will decide for President Putin's party, United Russia.
After a very closed election campaign, she confirms her ambition for stability, even for authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message to the voters broadcast to the public broadcasters, which has already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He is doing this in his capacity as the leading candidate of the United Russia, the Pro-Kreml party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, the President didn't let anything happen when he received the foreign ambassadors, and he was pleased to provide a new point of attack against the West Powers, who were accused of the interference – his favorite theme during the election campaign.
We know the price of a true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they lost their minds.
She is pranging a campaign of oppression.
The Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there had never been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the oppression of the demonstrations last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days imprisonment for illegal demonstration, according to his lawyer's prohibition of visit.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus
After these Parliamentary elections without tension, there are two far-reaching questions:
Who will be the president of Putin's success?
The official newspaper announced yesterday the date of the first election of the presidential elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates have time to make themselves known by 23 December.
As he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin could not enter a third consecutive mandate.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
President of the majority of Parliament and the Almighty United Russia Party, will elect the government and President?
Whatever it will be, at the parliamentary elections or at the presidential elections, the current power will triumph.
That's tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus, they are not the master of their destiny, says Sociologist Lev Goudkov, Director of the Independent Centre Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov from the State University of St. Petersburg is even further declining: the civil society has developed very slowly in this country, which has been christianized for five centuries to Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has reconnected to the model of a paternalist state, which was fully accepted by the population, even more since this new paternalism did not follow terror, but some economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians give up their personal responsibility in the short term after the collapse of the USSR.
Think about what for a long time?
This phenomenon concerns all levels of society, including the business world.
And the administrative elite understands to hold the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional presidents) are leading the local electoral lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West often mean chaos, as in the 1990s.
The public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote in favour of the extremist parties.
Conclusion by Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: Why do you think for a long time?
Those who are in power are not so bad, why are they redeeming?
A Heavy Remembrance
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which were located at a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, have not been viewed until now, except with a humanitarian intention, i.e. individual and name-related, i.e. a request from a former victim or his family.
In May 2006 the eleven States, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed to make them accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Hot Information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow for research, especially through the deportation of prisoners, the inmates of concentration camps and the state of health of forced workers, explains Reto Masters, head of these archives, managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these names-related documents available to the public, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The lists of prisoners of the concentration camps or the arrest orders issued by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest, so as to give them the way to their compensation.
Today, more than 300 festive employees are working on tens of thousands of personal questions in Bad Arolsen.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
There is nothing to expect fundamentally new in these documents," said Dr. Wolfgang Benz, Head of the Research Centre for Antisemitism at the Technical University of Berlin, 2006.
The EU and India want to obtain a free trade agreement in 2008.
At present, mutual trade between India and Europe is already reaching the 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India's largest trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, indicated that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU's Foreign Ministers had given the European Commission green light last April to open negotiations to sign free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the ninth trading partner of the EU.
A free trade pact will make huge progress in both economic areas and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans , Peter Mandelson confirmed.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most commonly exported products in India, said the European Commissioner. Asian and European giants exchange goods worth 47 billion euros each year and services worth 10 billion euros, said Daniéle Smadja, President of the European Commission's New Delhi Delegation, and regrets that mutual trade has not yet exhausted its potential. The EU and India will meet on Friday on their eighth diplomacy in New Delhi, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barrosso.

The Bank of England notes the concern and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England expressed concern about reducing the recurrent concern about the credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with unusual maturity.
In order to mitigate the fears that the conditions on the financial market will be particularly difficult at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they will organise their liquidity positions during this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its savings during the maintenance phase beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks , it states in a communication.
The Bank further explains that this is how GMT will circulate 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) on December 6th and only until January 10th.
This is apparently the first time that the BoE brings liquidity into circulation in an open market operation for five weeks.
This usually happens for a week.
The BoE adds in its communication that it is willing to take further measures to obtain the different interest rates of interbank loans with its basic interest rate from one day to the next.
The interbank interest rate varied from day to day was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has reached 6.6%, slightly higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums put into circulation by the Bank of England have been coupled with penalties that had prevented the banks from using them.
According to some rumours, reinforced by the development of the pound rate in contrast to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums put into circulation by the European Central Bank to more favourable interest rates and with more secure discretion.
UMP and NC reject to review PS proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which corresponds to a rejection of the text.
The text produced in the context of a socialist niche (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary grouping) indicated about ten measures adopted by the National Committee of the PS on Wednesday, most of which floated for employment allowances, for the reintroduction of the TIPP, for a transport check or for the limitation of rents.
After UMP and NC had voted against the review of the articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which gave occasion to partially violent exchanges of words between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television contribution on the purchasing power.
The leader of the members of the PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would present the whole of its proposals as an amendment to the bill on financial correction, which had been reviewed last week by the Assamblee.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the Festival Republic of British Producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who has served, no more and no less, as a model for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones from C3 told on Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably take place from 8-10 August on a 500 acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the world's most prestigious festivals.
In 1989 he took the lead of the United Kingdom Reading Festival, which attracts around 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, as a co-owner, has also taken care of production, license concessions and organisational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he's ever been at, says that his company and Melvin Benn's company work alongside each other to offer a European-style festival event.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and are working with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We conducted negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have remained in political debates about current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and meet preparations to create a great festival in an exceptional place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents has restored the 2005 Lollapalooza Festival in the Grand Park of Chicago after it has profiled itself in 2002 together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the world of the festival.
The two events were able to achieve $9.8 million in 2007 and $11.8 million in gross tax days.
These two festivals take place in the urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, while the ours are more on urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is, in some way, to merge these two concepts together in order to at the same time convey the impression of a rural festival on the European and a urban in the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, takes the burden of this event with joy," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to award the terms of the agreement, but he confirms, "that they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to introduce a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the recording capacity of the festival is "very large", corresponding to about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says the invitations have been sent to the groups, but nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse in the hope of attracting all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His partners from C3 who received the Top Independent Promoter Award for the last Bollboard Touring Award are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the terminator.
Not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood movies to Montreal if no less than the terminator stands against.
These lock attempts are part of the delegated tasks.
A political "heikle mandate", because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, accuses Runaway Productions.
Is it difficult to negotiate with the Governor?
"You have to be careful, because it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those you think are the best," he says.
The run on the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, at the moment the introduction of the cinema there has the highest priority.
The hunting for the Oscars started.
At all festivals on the west coast, although Sundance, the Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will be about presenting the films from Quebec, assessing them and ensuring that the producers give interviews.
The dark age had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
He will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and is presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock exchange ahead of a final year's rally? Disparity with experts due to the US hypothec crisis
With just five weeks up to the financial statements on the stock exchange, investors are already shaking their hands with regard to the next final year's rally.
Nevertheless, the experts cannot create safe forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that purely statistically, the month of December is usually associated with a positive market development on the stock exchange
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to create forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics. Especially when serious tensions determine the current market events
Although other experts do not agree to such a strong price increase in the last few weeks of the year, they note that the exchange rate is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market operator, which is mainly invested in pension funds due to the lack of secure equity funds, which is severely affected by the upturning trend of assets.
As a result, according to these experts, the stock exchange will have a rather lateral price trend, influenced by market fluctuations, especially because we cannot yet estimate the extent of the possible fall in the interest rate of the US bank, an uncertainty which is mainly due to the rise in the price of crude oil and the risk of rising inflation.
Javier Barrio, Chairman of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it was a daring time to announce a forthcoming market rally.
The opportunities are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its highest mark on November 8 of 15.945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, Ibex 35 could successfully conclude the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional pension fund grants made each year at that time.
Nevertheless, the expert stresses that this year things could evolve slightly differently, especially because of the final year’s rally already taking place in the second week of December, and thus directly after the day of the bridge to the day of the Constitution.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, analyst at Bank Inversis, the previous assessments of the market situation are at a nearly technical level, which could lead to a deviation from the index values, whose scales depended on the consequences of the US hypothetic market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
The analysts agree when selecting the values to promote the Ibex to new maximum levels.
Solana by Intermoney says that this year the great values are on the line.
Among the value-winners, the expert would include the two large banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha assures Bank Inversis that the increases will be linked to the banking and industrial sectors.
If the Rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS has been on pick-up course in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will take the same path, according to the expert.
With regard to the increased consumption behaviour during Christmas days, the market will be determined in the last half of the year of periodic consumption.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are represented in a small number on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December only showed a fall in two cases.
At the end of 2003, when the technology bubble fell, this led the stock exchange out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real final year rally.
This year, when the Ibex 35 picked up by 28.17 percentage points, December showed a price increase of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth winning year in a row (Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and also a final yearly rally will show itself.
Popular will have opened its 200 credit institutions from Mondays to Fridays 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of them are located in the most economically strong regions of Spain.
For the Institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches represent a major milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutes, as Popular is the first banking group to venture to extend the opening hours of its branches to 20.30 pm on weekdays and to set up on Saturdays from 10h to 20.30 pm.
The Banking Group BBVA, which also repeatedly announced the extension of its opening hours in its branches, has not yet taken a definitive decision.
The current negotiations of the Bank with the trade unions seem to aim at an agreement in which 75% of all branches will be concluded on Saturday and open up on one afternoon of the week, although not for the customer.
Whether other banks join the new initiative that adapts to business opening times will depend on the experiences of the Popular Bank.
And that's also the intention to pursue the popular with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches that, due to their situation, can capture the buy-in customerry of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large stores.
The Bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, since they are not new but changed opening times.
For this purpose, the Bank will restructure the premises of the branches already located in business zones and at the same time align them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the extension of opening times is associated with a new space design of the branches, which is characterized by a more modern, colourful design.
The competent bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring does not require major investments but that it was accompanied by an increase in staffing, since a branch now did not need six, but eight or nine employees.
The establishments, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tried his concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experiences were positive, according to Ángel Rivero.
The offices of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donell and Gran Vía have been selected for what seems to be a wise decision.
Popular currently runs about 2500 branches.
And another 60, which operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialised in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the BBVA model is not used, since most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to represent competition for our customers, Rivero explains.
With Telefonica, they have provisionally reached the agreement to sell mobile phones using external banking personnel.
For the first time, the Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco doubles its stock exchange value and thus overtakes its rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the Managing Director of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, expressed his satisfaction at the closing of the stock exchange. The broadcaster led by him had increased his value by twice his rival Antena 3.
However, one aspect dampened his joy: that's exactly what hurt me; not that we had a higher growth, but that we had less losses, he noted.
He stressed that, despite the weak market, they did not fall too deeply.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with a plus of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its losses this year to 15,66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company's value now reaches EUR 4.488.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the main share of capital (52%), and Vocento only participates with 13%.
The Rivale Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, so its market value is 2.193.46 million to half.
On the other hand, the market value of other listed communications companies increases to 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable, with Prisa (editor of Cinco Días) to 2.518.53 million and Vocento to 1.779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it is two similar companies, according to Vasile.
Uncertainly the question arises to what extent we can actually act on stock exchange technology, at what price and how we can make it profitable at customer level.
Telecinco announced a week ago his intention to rise to the first television station this year with more than 1000 million gross revenues from advertising. This assured Guiseppe Tringali, Managing Director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the advertising company of the group.
If the project was to be implemented, the broadcaster would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the stock exchange (up to 734.4%), while net revenue from the television business could only increase by 0.7% (630.4 million ).
The main factor for Telecinco's better stock exchange performance compared is the high payout ratio that the company has been able to present: in 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarría caused a 100% dividend.
Vasile, however, assures that after the purchase of 33% of the shares of Endemol, with Mediaset as a parent company, the ratio could still vary, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
We are obliged to pay at least 50% of the shares of the official compromise, even if we have so far given more and more.
I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders this year, whose stock values we have already been able to increase by buying 33% of the endmol shares.
According to the analysts, the market currently has certain trends in loss.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% this year and by 7% in 2009.
This is the result of a reduction in the expected growth rate, which will fall from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% in 2009 to 5.1% in 2008.
This also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 by 4.5% for 2008 and 7.5% for 2009.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: focuses on its high efficiency return and sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco (purchasing) measures a more advantageous position as a result of the many incentives and the prospering market than to hold antenna 3.
3.
JPM body: recommends that, in view of similar threats (saturated market and poor economic climate), the expectations be reduced in both cases.
The Congress agrees with the MIFID Directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel to the parliamentary preparation, which today ended its meeting with the Congress decision in the Senate on the additional/amendment proposals related to the project, the Government published the provisions arising from the new law in order to allow the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously commended the efforts of Congress and Senate members, who in their negotiations and votes had pursued the goal of establishing the best possible rules to ensure the security of investors and to regulate the individual entrepreneurial activities in order to ensure a generally efficient market process.
In addition to modernising financial markets, the MIFID, which re-establishes the Securities Services Regulation, seeks to improve investor protection, increase the Spanish Securities Commission's (CNMV) control claim and promote cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive enables both specialized companies and natural or legal persons to provide financial advice and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS) to consulting companies joining investment and intermediary companies in securities.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions, so that the regulated market markets will be added to the multilateral systems of securities business and to the systems of internationalisation of trade orders, which would finally compete with the current economic operators.
The Act obliges investment companies to report the focus of their corporate profile, confrontation and the forms of dealing with risks on the market and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate CNMV's control tasks.
Afterwards, the Congress's Economic Commission proposed further changes, with the decision that the securities bond must now be considered as a complex financial resource for the investor because of its high risk level, has been confirmed by the US hypothetic and banking crisis. (US hypothetic crisis)
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of the areas of work of qualified economic scientists was used; 30 years after 1977 the regulation, which restricted the areas of work reserved for economic scientists, was adopted.
The Senate, for its part, established new positions in the financial sector, such as those of the economic mediator, who works on a foreign account, does not require approval by the CNMV and can at the same time offer its services to commercialize products and to gain customers several investment companies.
The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (ICP) increased by five tenths in November and is now 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the inflation rate within the European Union provides the average price developments in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which, by disclosure of the data, seek a comparison of location and quality with US products.
The forecast for the indicator can be drawn up in advance by using the same approach as for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to assess the unavailable information at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) indicated that the predetermined indicator should serve only as a guide value and therefore should not be consistent with the final result announced on the next 14 December.
The Consumer Price Index (ICP) will continue to be at a relatively high level
According to the Deputy Head of Government and the Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance Pedro Solbes, the increase in the VPI in November is a temporary development; at the same time, he assured that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless, Solbes found in the halls of the Congress building that even if the present number is not good , the inflation difference between Spain and the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less equal in recent years .
He also stated that in November there were fewer surprises than in the previous month, in which the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a value of around 4% , announced the Minister of Economics and Finance with regard to the forecast published today.
Virgin counts with Northern Rock revenues of over 42 billion euros in the next three years
Northern Rock's assets have fallen by more than half after the Bank had requested an emergency credit from the British bank in mid-September of last year, and now they are only GBP 12,000 million (that is, EUR 16,800 million).
At that time, the Bank's assets amounted to record 25,000 million pounds, a sum that has declined significantly within two and a half months due to the loss of confidence of customers and, despite the 100% government guarantee that the money is safe, will continue to fall until the end of the crisis.
The company Virgin, which would continue the group after the acquisition under the brand name Virgin Money, has to inject about one quarter of the revenue of the British banks, which will consist of the plants of the next three years, to purchase exactly those 18 billion pounds that are still needed to achieve their 30 billion target.
The group of Richard Branson, a multimillionaire, known by his remarkable advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to make 50 000 million pounds (equivalent to around 70 million euros) flow annually into advertising and marketing campaigns to reach his goal.
This week Northern Rock named the Virgin Group, in which three other companies are involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of the insolvency.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged suspicion of participation in urban corruption
This morning, the Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the town of Totano (Partido Popular), which belongs to Murcia City, due to the urgent suspicion of urban corruption that was discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo represented last May the office of Juan Morales, currently a member of the Partydo Popular and at the time Chairman of the Municipal Council of Totana, and could, according to information from the radio station Cadena SER, be the original wire drawer of the plot.
Officials continue to search the business documents of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not exclude further arrests over the next few hours.
In addition, the lawyer was accused by Juan Morales, the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered at the beginning of this week.
According to information from Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular , and therefore privileged MEP Juan Morales was arrested when leaving his client's residence due to important burdensome documents to be related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information about Morales' alleged order payments to a galician construction company that planned the conclusion of a city building contract, which decided to build a 200-hectare area.
At the moment, eight people are in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the candidateship of the PSOE in Toledo and, in the case of an election victory, to the Congress.
The former Minister of Defense José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, to list the PSOE candidates at the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of a victory of the Socialists, take over the office of the President of Congress.
For example, José Blanco, the organisational secretary of the PSOE, and Bono announced at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero at the party headquarters today.
According to the Head of Government, the offer to the former minister is justified because it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the event of a victory for the socialists in the forthcoming elections, the politician from Mancha would seem to be candidate as the president of the Congress for the party.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as Congress President, who had announced last November 15th that he would no longer join the next general elections, end his career in public policy and instead engage in the university field of climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the President of the Government had continually insisted on his return to political events.
He also pointed out that, as in the appointment of the Vice-President for Economic Affairs, the party did not want to abstain from the citizens who would take over the position of the President of the Congress in the event of a win in elections, and described this as an act of transparency.
If he should actually take over the office, he hopes to convert the chamber into a house of respect and not the insult or the scream, so that it may appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, one gets the impression from time to time that the only place where one cannot speak quietly and quietly in Madrid is the Congress, so the President of the Government has been interrupted in the Senate 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Martín and his good work and indicated that he did not want to raise the impression that he had already taken over the office, otherwise his political counterparts would call this an arrogance.
Climate propaganda
Since the climate debate is subjected to unpleasant criticism of both the scepticists of climate change as well as those who focus on a social and political debate in this regard, the movement as a whole must show strong cohesion.
Especially when it is a leader of the movement who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal brings him into a statement on the action or non-action of his Government, which has made a decisive contribution to ensuring that Spain is at the top of the countries within the EU which have the least complied with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who are the responsible for failing to fulfil the requirements, which sectors are responsible for this, and why has its government, which proposed the Treaty with the planet, not stopped this development?
In addition, he is now forced to present to the Spanish citizens the measures to combat climate change that he intends to take.
Which companies will be affected by the behaviour of citizens to be changed, the individual and collective savings measures to be carried out and the economic consequences of this.
More specifically, who has to sacrifice himself and will pay for the salvation of the planet.
However, there will and will not be any such explanations in the future.
It's just because it's about sacrifice and paying.
Because the measures that can be used in real terms against climate change are unpopular.
They are costly, uncomfortable and threatening the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the petrol centre proposed by PSOE appeared to be so dangerous in the election strategy that he was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Therefore, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty proverbs without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, Commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the political party who is otherwise suitable for election campaigns must neither speak, nor accuse, nor demand, but instead follow the demanding issue, decorate the meetings and with his mildness and kindness enthusiasm others.
But this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not presume that the bike will become the only means of moving forward in the future, or we can only refresh ourselves with one compartment.
The mayor and the chief of the police of Totana due to a alleged involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the Murcia-owned village of Totana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. In addition, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor office and a hotel entrepreneur were detained for suspected urban breaches, today it was called out of investigation circles.
The city council was arrested at its place of residence, from where he was brought to the municipal office and in its premises until now, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and the municipal construction management of Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are linked to the searches that have already taken place in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid last Monday, which showed that more than 2 million hectares of unrecovered land for urban projects should be redesigned under the leadership of the Galician construction company Nuaria, which should build 4000 apartments on the property, after the local administration has read illegal commissions to it during the last legislative period.
In addition, although two more persons were not arrested directly, they were subjected to an investigation procedure which was initiated and carried out by the First Court of Totona.
The first six arrested persons have been presented to the judge today.
According to investigation circles, it is also investigated against the former mayor of Totana and the current independent PP member Juan Morales.
His ex-wife, the owner of a property company registered in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend residing in Murcia, are also suspected.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria group, the Vigo lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the Managing Director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company is supposed to be a member of Nuaria and have received the lubrication money.
The investigations are carried out by the Municipal Authority against urban delicts, under the supervision of the Central Unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven further investigations, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the holder of a regionally known poultry farm that should have acted as a middle man.
The Nuaria building group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex of Murcia, which should include more than 5,000 apartments, one golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometers of area to be rebuilt in Totana. The aim was to achieve a construction project that would increase the population of the municipality to 25 000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group comprises other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates the parking spaces of Coruña streets in Vigo, Venezuela and Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activities are limited to the direct marketing sector and Preconiza, specializing in the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.
Things that may happen

Our Finnish correspondent explains the comment published yesterday in the main Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (Finland is, by the way, at the top of the PISA study), which relates to the comment published in the same newspaper on November 18th; randomly on the day the issue contained the criticism of the book Blackburns.
After the tragedy around Jokela's school, the content of the subject philosophy has become the subject of public debate.
Responsible for the cruel murders is an abituriant who in his news quoted the works of Platons and Nietzsche.
The Chair of the Education Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, called on teachers to take a more critical position in relation to Platon in an interview in the Helsinki Sanomat newspaper and proposed to remove the teaching of Platon from the sub-level curriculum for Philosophy in Higher Schools.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the Penal Code:
A. The download of a song would be a breach of law that would be affected by six months of imprisonment.
However, if you rob a music business below a value of EUR 400, this is only considered to be a simple breach (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1,000 euros, then, although theft is committed as a criminal offence, the penalty is less than for a download (Article 234 Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and give it back forty hours later, the penalty is still less than when you download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than in a music data exchange.
Participating in a rebellious conflict will result in a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 Penal Code), while the exchange of data will result in a deduction of freedom from six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Penal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment at work is considered less bad than downloading a DVD movie from the Internet.
F. Trade in copyright-protected films, whose authors did not authorize, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague should be right, then someone has made his demands quite clear.

My doctor gives me one of his long, strange research articles titled: Money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially when others get more.
So the feelings arising from the monthly pay depend on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was prepared using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last edition of the science magazine Science.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonner Hirnforschungszentrum Life&Brain, the activation was the strongest when the participant gave the right answers and his co-player failed.
The researchers could realize that brain activities were always very moderate if both participants were properly responding and thus received the same salary; but when one of them received the double, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it really requires so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The Balkan Attorney
Carla del Ponte has been inexcusably looking for the criminals of the Balkan wars for eight years. Her office is located in the State Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia, based in La Haya.
Her mandate will end at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a crying and smiling eye, as the main leaders of the Srebrenica massacre - the eight thousand Bosnian Muslims died - namely the former General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic are still on their own.
Their names are on the list of director Marcel Schüpbach, from Switzerland, as a model for the title of his documentary films La Liste de Carla (2006, Spain), a film that, with the pace of a political thriller, pursues the Swiss attorney from Belgrade to New York in her project to detect the escaped criminals and put the respective governments under pressure so that they can tighten their networks.
What insurance is best for me?
The motor vehicle insurance, which covers a possible damage caused by the driver, involves a high cost, the amount of which depends on various factors, such as age, gender, date of issue of the driving licence, family status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
To own a car is only the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the appropriate KFZ insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, it must be clear what we have to do here.
Auto insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurance undertaking.
This agreement shall be concluded in writing by means of an insurance contract which establishes that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and, in return, is obliged to submit the corresponding amount of the disbursement in case of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance that consists of several factors, including age, gender, date of issue of the driving licence, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance companies set their prices according to statistics, so that higher contributions are also payable in the event of a higher risk of accident.
For this reason, both 25-year-olds and women need to pay less contributions, as statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same applies to married persons as they tend to be less accidental than those alone, according to statistical values, and therefore to the firm's conviction.
The benefit given to the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and thus the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
In the setting of the premium, insurance must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance that best meets his personal needs.
We now listen to the main points that should be considered when choosing an insurance in order not only to make a performance-oriented, but also to make a price-oriented choice.
The under 25-year-olds encounter numerous obstacles when choosing cheap insurance, such as low driving practices and the young driver's license.
Even if it is best for an ideal insurance protection to complete a full cash insurance, there are still more affordable alternatives.
The cautious drivers can choose a full-casco with self-sufficiency, so that the benefits of a full-cass insurance are covered but offered at a low price.
This type of contract implies that the customer must pay a part of the amount incurred by the damage itself.
The amount will be fixed prior to the conclusion of the contract and based on the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher than the amount to be paid , explains Luis Noguera, the main representative of Spain at First Europe, an intermediary for online insurance.
Another option is the extended insurance, which assures customers against external damage to accidents, but not against damage caused by their own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, it is in your hand to reduce insurance costs; so your credit increases by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate of the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment includes an increase in the tariffs referred to.
The amount of credits and penalties depends on the company and its income.
If the company has a profitable year behind it can be able to increase the bonus payments, Noguera explains.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for the drivers to conclude a contract. The reason for this is that with increasing driving practice the accident rate decreases.
Therefore, it is most appropriate to choose a full cash insurance with self-sufficiency.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish director of the European company, and adds that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the fear of the beginner has been lost.
However, it is more advisable for a married customer who does not have children to make full cash insurance; of course only if it allows the financial situation of the person concerned.
On the part of the insurers, couples with children are considered to be the customers with the lowest accident rate, and consequently their contribution payments are also low.
In this case, full cash insurance with equity (for a sum of EUR 300) would be the best option. In the case of a high credit, an extended insurance is recommended, which is not used until the third year of the vehicle.
They are generally more relaxed and have a greater purchasing power that allows them to make a higher contribution payment, says Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, it is possible to conclude a full cash insurance with self-sufficiency (for a amount of 150 euros) or an extended insurance that only uses a sufficient amount of credit.
Finally, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible damage to the accident, but also because it bears high costs that require a thorough selection that corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes in Milan for the 8th final
The FC Milan and the Celtic Glasgow will fight in San Siro next Tuesday for the point they lack to achieve their respective goals before the end of the champion's league. The Italians need the point to get to the top of their group, while it decides on their participation in the Scotlands.
The Italian team already has five points and confirmed its participation in the fifth round with an indecisive in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow with nine points needed another to make sure that the FC Shakhtar with six points did not catch the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of Group D will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as the FC Milan will have to join the FIFA World Cup in Japan, where he will fight for the first time in the semifinal on the 13th for the final, which will take place on the 16th.
So this group will be completed before all the others and the indeterminate in the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the overall expected result, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home the Keltik Glasgow knows that in the event of a victory they would have a better starting position in the 8th final.
Gordon Strachan's team could even have a defeat in a sleeve of FC Shakhtar to qualify. However, he should not trust too much in such circumstances, because at nine points the Ukrainens were allowed to participate; they had lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but they could win at the second game (2-0).
Thus, the Mailanders will try to waste the evening to the Scots. They hope to reach the eighth final of the redesigned champion's league for the second time in a row after they have been defeated in the same game season by a gate of caka in the post-play time (1-0) and by a zero independence on the game.
While the FC Shakhtar is waiting for the Rossoneri victory, the team will have to focus on its own game, as both the Achtth Final and its membership in the UEFA depend on its victory and a defeat of the Celtic Glasgow.
In spite of its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the largest European championship, the Benfica Lisbon could win third place and thus participate in the UEFA.
20,000 people visit the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls gave the start shot for their first tour after the band was dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) explained shortly before the start of their concert at the GM Place de Vancouver Stadium that the mood in the reunited band was excellent.
Around the 20,000 people were able to experience the concert in the out-selling stadium, where a video of the history of the band, which had provided furors at the end of the 1990s, was shown.
The reunification and the world tour overlap with the publication of a new album, which includes its biggest hits and two more new songs, headlines and voodoo, which appears in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore golden ties on stage, which they had previously given by the husband of Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the fan masses in the audience that led the GM Palace to shine, although the nerves of his wife Victoria had banned him in the previous days.
During the preparations for the Shove Victoria Beckham told us that the British star did not get our wardrobe on the face for a single time, and that's why I'm very excited about what he's going to think about the show.
Sporty Spice , whose withdrawal from the group in 1998 due to internal differences of opinion two years later led to the resolution of the group, expressed her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that the feelings had changed to the Spice Girls.
And that's why I thought why not; so I'm glad to have made this decision, Chisholm commented on the separation of the band that she had caused nine years ago.
The singer was also told that the disputes were resolved and that, in the meantime, they were all very happy.
Nevertheless, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of Spice Girls in 1998.
First, according to CTV's report, the group arrived in a special machine at Virgin Airlines in Vancouver.
On their arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army of childbirds.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will appear next in California, San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
They will enter the stage in Madrid on December 23rd.
New concerns about gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute between Ukraine and Russia increased the risk that Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe would be affected.
The majority of Russian natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) is led by Ukraine and any dispute between the two nations is monitored very closely.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for gas, Russia will charge higher transit charges.
An earlier conflict between the two countries last year reduced deliveries to the EU countries.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow occurs at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian gas monopoly Gazprom attempt to reach agreement on how much Ukraine has to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be calculated more, as the Group has agreed to pay up to 50% more for natural gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in discussions," said the Ukrainian Minister for Economic Affairs Anatoli Kinakh of Reuters News Agency.
"The changing natural gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit fees [to Western Europe] through Ukraine."
In the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom shortened supplies to Ukraine.
This resulted in a case of exports to Western Europe, which led to a drastic increase in prices.
Russian gas accounts for one quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas reserves, but much of them remain underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom supplements its own stocks with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service needs to improve the checks of criminal records for workers from outside Europe, said a member of the control body outside.
The recommendation of the Chief Financial Controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought in connection with the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish State Health Service does not have any accurate ideas regarding the number of its foreign employees.
However, his report pointed out that other important controls were carried out correctly at a sample of five health authorities.
The main financial controller investigated staff recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area following the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video transmission in Old Bailey in October, and was loaded in connection with the alleged car bombing attack in the UK.
It is expected that the State Health Service will carry out checks prior to the recruitment of foreign workers to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorisations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review criminal records, the Agency does not have the competence to obtain such information outside the UK.
The auditor's report now states, in addition to other recommendations, that the board should address guidelines for the withdrawal of criminal records to help employers in checks in different countries.
"Although we found evidence of these checks in some staff documents, they were not routinely carried out," the report noted.
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would follow their investigation guidelines with a high degree prior to employment, but added: "Our report shows areas in which the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information on the number of foreign health workers is available."
BMA Scottish Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations prior to the recruitment of potential NHS employees would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report states that the current pre-employment tests of the NHS Scotland work well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will deliver," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, most of which are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number was likely to be higher, even because the boards had problems identifying those employees who were on indefinite leave.
The investigation continued to find that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian were largely respected.
These include passport, work permit and qualification checks.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for pre-employment checks for foreign personnel in the NHS.
The health secretary Nicola Sturgeon said, "It was a concern for me to carry out this work in the face of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that best practices would be reflected in updated guidelines on inspection investigations prior to the appointment of all employees, including those from abroad, whose publication is planned next month.

The prize for the best performer went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as driver of a Russian mafia booth in David Cronenberg's London Thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who is in the reputation to play hard guys, has picked up the Richard Harris prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones continuation The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the prize named in honor of Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me," he said.
"I had the luck to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my type of man, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored."
The independent film awards, known as Bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia discovered yesterday that it arrested 208 soldiers because of their belonging to cells that had planned an imminent attack on an oil plant as well as on clergy and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells had planned to smuggle rockets.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an allies of the United States since 2003, as a result of the invasion in Iraq.
A cell of eight soldiers, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000 man strong rapid intervention force to protect plants following a misleaded Al Quaida attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an internal ministerial statement, says that 18 of the arrested belonged to a cell led by a "missile expert" who illegally entered the country.
He reports that the soldiers planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the Kingdom.
According to the report, another 22 of the detainees were planning to kill clergymen and security forces.
The government has warned clergymen to do more to stop Saudis who strive to Iraq to join Al Qaida militias who want to fight the Allied Armed Forces and the U.S. supported Shiite Muslim government, which is considered kezerical by the Hardliners among the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaida militias consider many clergymen in Saudi Arabia to be in cooperation with the authorities in supporting the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militia - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaida born in Saudi Arabia, to target the pro-western Saudi government - have refrained from foreign residential areas, government buildings and facilities in the energy sector.
"This was a very great effort by the security forces over the last five months," a spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior told the state television.
The arrests also concerned a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which was intended to advertise for "Takfiri Thinking" - the ideology of the radical Sunni Muslims, supporting violence against Muslims who are branded as disbelievers and apostates.
Among the arrested were also 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militia.
The climate on the Venus could show a view of the future of the earth
The Venus was perhaps a pleasant place to live, said scientists yesterday.
Data from a European spaceship on a crossroads show that the planet is even more similar to a turned twin of the earth than has been aware so far.
The Venus is the nearest planetary neighbour of the earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and have similar planetary tracks, but the Venus of the Sun is slightly closer.
billions of years ago, scientists believe that Venus would have ruled conditions that would have been very similar to those on earth and could even have been inhabitable today.
But because of the unrestricted carbon dioxide engine effect, the erosion of the atmosphere due to solar radiation and a slower rotation rate, the Venus started a completely different development course.
Today the planet is robbed of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the Venus Express space probe of the European Space Agency, which has investigated the plants for a year, provide a depressing view of how the earth could develop in the face of disaster climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor from the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, one of the leaders of the Venus Express Mission, said: "It is clear why the climate on the Venus is so different from that on Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
"Our new data enables us to construct a scenario in which the Venus began billions of years ago such as the Earth, possibly with an inhabitable environment."
"Enriched Uranium" confiscated by the police
A kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police officer said that three people were arrested and that the material was being checked.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said that it could have been sold for $1 million (£480,000).
Everything still open
My Romey said he did not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be interviewed by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the Presidency finally expressed its willingness to take up a debate on YouTube, to record and submit questions on video in the ordinary voters to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28, were as ridiculous as the Snowman, who interviewed the Democrats about global warming in the other party's YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, reflected exactly the state of the Republican party that broke up in the elections next year.
It is not known, just like the producers of CNN, who supported the debate with the selected YouTube clips to show the upcoming candidates.
However, in the first half-hour of the debate, which was the longest devoted to a single topic, immigration was the focus.
The topic is one of the most striking issues for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of indefinite voters to use a polling disc when they heard things they liked: The television station noticed peaks of consent when the candidates spoke strictly across the borders.
The closest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national leader, and Romney, who moved forward in the crucial surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to shake the reputation that he had been diligent about illegal immigration when he was Mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former Governor of Massachusetts of recruiting illegal immigrants for work at his house.
The two were particularly stuck apart as questioners asking whether one of the candidates would support a "amnesty" (the illegals would give a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, managed to track this issue.
None of the two men have serious chances in nominating, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they have been haunted earlier and harder than others.
At least in the field of immigration, candidates share the same views in general: stricter borders, intolerance to illegal migrants.
This theme, along with fears of poisonous toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps the Republicans to forget or minimise the differences between Liberals and Christian Conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic when other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered as torture.
One of the questioners asked whether the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to take the view that although the Bible is his preferred book, he may not believe the story of Jonah and the Wal literally.
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pushed to see if Jesus would support them, he laughed about them and said that Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains exceptionally open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa falls together with Ron Paul's recent donation successes and his applause storms in the Wednesday debate.
These two have been shot out of nothing because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more famous and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate has the party from the beginning and convincingly united with a victorious message about the size of America and a twinger to both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another mine to fall in; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly sloppy.
No noble titles seem to be sold, no politician paid Paris hotel bills, no extramarriage toes were closed.
But the discovery that a rich businessman has hidden donations to the British ruling Labour Party over more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this, is something without what the convicted Gordon Brown would have done well.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister had withdrawn the call for an election, in a stupid way insulting the intelligence of the British by claiming that polls did not affect this decision, there was hope that it would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly sharp-minded chairman of the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, the once feared Brown from Stalin has developed to Mr. Bean.
The unskilled rescue of Northern Rock, an attacked bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Badly thought-out proposals to amend tax laws have brought companies' associations against the government.
The tax loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative pruishes.
A trio of retired generals began a revolt in the upper house from protests against reductions in military expenditure: being a minister of military forces, they claimed to be a part-time job.
Now there are the diverse donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour Secretary General (and his former leader) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown breaks in irrevocably towards resignation.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point after which they feel it is impossible to rule.
Neither do people like politicians, nor do they trust, but they usually hold back their scepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister will improve the situation, and he doesn't even need to be there for a long time, this delay is over: the public service begins to be disturbed; the Cabinet ministers begin to talk; the press is looking for bad news; and the government becomes defensive and untargeted.
In one way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new besen.
So much he would like to deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax jurisdiction documents, for example, are related to decisions made by Brown as the Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if it was not directly involved in Blair's mishandledness - as with the long " money for noble titles" investigation of political party funding - the voters may assume that it was him.
Nonetheless, Brown's situation is not as bad as she looks
The errors are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, or was completely swollen.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown's, of course, has always promised Stalinist trends: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new gesture of political donations is a good example.
The garboeske Abraham's, who compares his donations with his non-profit gifts, says that he does not wish public recognition for his goodwill.
This may be the case, but he was not able to make a decision about it.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he knew about Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, of course, will have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's principal financial collector, who was told about the strange donations in October.
But until now Brown is not involved: there is nothing that suggests that he knew of these confusions, although most of the payments were made after his appointment in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he irrigated this determination by the grab by a well-known instrument, an investigation committee on the subject - in order to complete the measure, by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the "learning to be drawn" is not very complicated.
If the law has been broken, it's a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairman of the Independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been unoccupied for six months, and moving forward with a comprehensive reform of political party financing.
This would require the hardliners of Labour to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a partymate like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partial facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear leadership in the polls of opinions; he has two years to regain voters; and the only way he can achieve a victory is through unquestionable righteousness and solid competence.
Card Shark
Is the credit crisis on the American credit card market?
When blood is in the water, it's only natural that spindles are thrilled around.
Now that America's real estate market is offending, the predators have the country's credit card market in sight.
Analysts from Goldman Sachs expect that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the risk of infection spreads from underfunded loans to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both denominations and in seam rates, which measure the share of loans that are not recoverable or more than 30 days too late.
The HSBC announced last month that it took a $1.4 billion fee collection from its US consumer financing, partly due to the weakness of credit card recipients.
It's still too early to panic.
Losses and nuts are still low.
According to the Moody rating agency, the third quarter seam rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The decline in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
An amendment to the US private insolvency law in 2005 led to an abrupt case of bankrupt notifications which, in turn, represent a large proportion of chain card losses; the number of notifications (and thus seam fees) would increase again, whether the general conditions for creditors are deteriorating or not.
Industry also reports solid rates of payments that show how much of its debt consumers pay off each month
and confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the stagnation in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney from the TowerGroup, a research company, expects that the spending volumes for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
Direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market are certainly there: it is more likely that consumers will absorb credit card debts, now that home credits are drying out.
However, the card exhibitors look at the cash flow instead of capital, so falling home prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the creditworthiness of the creditor.
You can even be of advantage to the card exhibitors.
The incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates will decrease if the real estate is less than the value of the loan; as a result, card debts become more important under the repayment priorities.
Card exhibitors can also react much faster and more flexiblely than creditors to the more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid reassessment of assets.
"We will not wake up one day and reassess the loans completely," says Gary Perlin, Capital One's main financial officer.
Even if a sudden coverage crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable downturn are much more real.
If lower home prices and a credit reduction push America into the recession, industry will undoubtedly face a worse future.
Keep them looking forward to these sharks.
British bankers commit guilty in the Enron case
Three British bankers who were to be brought to court for their role in the fraudulent system with the former Chief Financial Officer of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their request on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially pleaded innocently for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications means for supposedly conspirating with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000, in order to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure had been initiated on January.
But during a hearing in court before the U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty of a case of fraud using telecommunications equipment.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, were known in the UK during two-year delivery procedures.
In the United States, their case is a loose end to an investigation initiated after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The allegations originally filed against them in 2002 pointed out by Fastow that he was the goal of an investigation by the government in connection with the Enron decline.
The accusation against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims that they had come to Houston in 2000 to extract a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top advisor Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron, controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron companies that contributed to breaking the company into the bankruptcy structure.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank estimated its participation in the subsidiary to be zero, but the three British men knew that it actually had significant value.
A company under Kopper's control acquired the Bank's shares in the subsidiary for 1 million dollars.
The bankers paid koper $250,000 for a participation in this company.
According to the charges, Fastow falsely claimed to Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But actually the $20 million went to British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million dollars, while Fastow, Kopper and others estimated about 12.3 million dollars, according to the charge.
In January 2004, Fastow declared himself guilty of conspiracy in two points of charges for his role in Enron's Pleite.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is sentenced to six years in Louisiana's federal prison.
Kopper is sentenced three years and one month in an institution in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was freely on the basis of a $1 million deposit that made it necessary for them to live in the United States waiting for the trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest company of the nation, broke down in the bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks had no longer been able to hide the billions of debt or make companies appear profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were condemned last year for their roles in connection with the Enron collapse.
Skilling imposes a penalty of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were cancelled after he died last year for heart disease.
Not all down in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a RollsRoyce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But that's a little money for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers space for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you ask for so many seats because it is for a private family or a company president."
Firer was at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the millionaire exhibition, a four-day orgy of the consumption presented, organized in a sealed exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had built exhibition booths, hoping to interest new Russians in everything, from Mahagoni-plated yachts to diamond-coated car grilles that would be suitable for 50 cents.
Firer took care of a shiny orange Porsche at the next stand of the fair.
"This is a nice car, but it's small money compared to us," he said.
According to the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft.
Heated by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems so flooded with money as Dallas at its shine times.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went to Europe in crowds where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi-Arabian overflighters of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the most visible freelance issuers in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of gold robbery.
This week, elsewhere in Moscow, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, attracted to exchange ideas about how to sell high-cost goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billions, holding a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, worth $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts from the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, an expert body here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the minimum of existence.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that is why we are all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jewelier.
She attended the fair for the first time with the Russian dealer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all well maintained and the men are all worth a fortune."
While they travel Sunday night in evening clothes through the halls, two real estate brokers, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, call themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and I tried to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Mrs. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she wore, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed to focus primarily on the new rich, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand in a stau for several hours to visit a dedicated warehouse, which tastelessly placed Cadillac Escalades, Platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick ice cream, tailored billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddy bears next to each other.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (USD 44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, the patriotic man sitting at a stand of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt image made of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in climbing climates."
In fact, the dealers here say that the Russians have already moved with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) from large-scale logos to the kind of naked brands with limited numbers that would not be marketed at a trade show.
Nonetheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, militaries, or simply tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil beds here, said he had sold two $700,000 mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with seamless gold threads.
Also on the first night Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, said that his company had sold the glorious orange Porsche for $1700,000 to a Russian millionaire.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, said to a company that adapts luxury cars to customer demands, he would have sold three car cooler grilles for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which are similar to each other chain tyres, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter an author fog developed for a Russian casino owner with spears he had covered with colorful Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a rouletterad.
The cost: $22,000 for a four-place.
"The Russian millionaire, who wants to have a picture of his wife's face from cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive on these wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He will store it in his 30 or 40-way garage."
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian Millionaries" would not express much exclusiveness at the moment, given the rise in local real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably already millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you believe."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich in a stand operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red phone cells according to the British model, which were full-toped with mountains of false millions of dollars tickets.
Azad Karryev, the marketing director of the company, said his employees had printed 500,000 false banknotes for the millionaire fair.
Passengers stopped to throw the money crowds around, mobile phone photos, while they resisted in the middle of the replacement wealth, to be cut by friends, or simply injecting a few million.
"Behold, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Explained operation suspected of death in New Jersey
It was the day before the harvest thanksfest when Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched as an ambulance at the white Cape Cod held two doors further down on the West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car there.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the caravan of the medical body viewer coming," said Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone was dead."
The hearings learned that the dead Ms. Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant of the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators try to find out if she died for a procedure carried out by an unauthorized, cosmetic surgeon who did not identify the police and who worked in the house at West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet identified what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxicological investigations, whose results could not be available for weeks, will help to clarify a mysterious death that has sent a grief through the head of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant of the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and stubborn," Mr. McCarthy said about Mrs. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pitbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer working for the alcohol control commission, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11 and one stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a speaker for the Union County Attorney, Theodore J. Romankow, said that investigators would try to find out whether Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized, surgical treatment.
"This is one of the possibilities," said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's a ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 p.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have informed little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't want to say if Mrs Castro was interviewed by the authorities.
The investigators are trying to determine whether a part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs Castro's house, where a welded rose shrub stands in the close courtyard and a dalmatian bells behind the house.
A blue barrel marked with "Ethylen vanillin" - used as a replacement for vanilla in food and perfume - was sitting in the parking lot next to a door that led to the ground floor.
Two mountain bikes hanged from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark for the first time after 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was of invaluable value and helped him find himself in the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that'," he said.
"She was always here when I arrived here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the Central Bank will lower interest rates will lead to an increase in world stock markets
The shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after market hopes that the Central Bank will try to calm the credit markets by further interest reductions, were reinforced by the vice-president of the US Central Bank.
The stock markets rose in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kahn, Ben Bernanke, President of the Central Bank, said that policy must respond "flexibly and pragmaticly" to the ongoing pressure on financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm down detrimental markets in the face of signs of emerging credit tensions, Kohn said that the recent turbulences had "partly reversed some of the improvements to market functions from the late part of September and October".
If the increased turbulence persisted, it would increase the possibility of further tightening the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the central bank is willing to intervene and stabilize the credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest reductions.
The presentations also helped to calm Wall Street, in view of further bad news from the US economy, now that the sales of US real estate reached a new record in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulences were highlighted by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that it will eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 per cent of its global employees, in a cost reduction measure to offset serious losses from their lost bets in the US mortgage credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these jobs will disappear in London, where the Bank employs 1,500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent to close at 13.289.40, while the broader S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index increased by 165,5 points, or 2.7 percent to close at 6.306.2, which added more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard values.
Germany's Dax index grew by 2.6 per cent and France's CAC40 grew by 2.3 per cent.
Previously, the re-emergence of credit pressures on the markets had been stressed after a strong demand for a three-month auction of guarantee funds from the European Central Bank granted to the European Trade Banks had been granted significantly 4.7 per cent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the U.S. Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow and to feed further capital into the London money markets increased when the three-month "Libor" councils for loaning between UK banks increased by 6.59 percent to their highest since late September, after a continuous increase since 21 November.
England faces a decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the other.
Who's supposed to beat as number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevant in a wider context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the election, is here, at least under this special title, to help the chief coach Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English managing director, gradually fills up with applications for national voters, if not for which part-time.
Anyone who doesn't get the sixth position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sports is undoubtedly.
It is never easy to nail exactly what makes it possible for a person to reach the top of his profession, while someone else never goes beyond the lowest rank, sometimes because of lack of happiness rather than ability.
It is not only in the cricket, where selection is difficult, where judgments are needed, which are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time to get up for Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same may be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young managers with good qualifications, should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricket player, unless he is given the opportunity to swim or fall.
Of course, numbers have a great influence on decisions, but opportunities have this too.
Within a team, a cricket player has to catch the captain's eye at the right time when he can take a whack and a beater has to get regular opportunities on the order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricket player.
Catching the eyes of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who were better in the last season than, for example, James Anderson, who apparently will play in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison himself declared himself healthy and how the wind bulbs into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class Wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hoped for more.
Whether Shah or Bopara play at the Asgiriya Stadium can only be a question of view.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five whickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, still fighting to fortify himself, who created the breakthrough to a major test cricket player and who, although he scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia, might still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will follow their conservative instincts and abdominal feelings for Shah's greater experience of Bopara's youth enthusiasm after a further discussion during today's network session at the Asgiriya Stadium.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his funkeling and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is seven years younger than 22, and an excellent balance against shot balls.
But Shah did only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a Middlesex player, and this, plus his immediate rejection from the selectors as Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the pulse out of his beat, which was still obvious in Bombay.
On the other hand, the All-Generator of Essex has a viscously joy of life.
He was impressed by nothing on a cricket place and his attitude from there was brought to the point when he had recently beaten a four-wheeled vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get his vodafone (of course also sponsored) out and to call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had observed this from a distance, and to say with enthusiasm, "Did you see that?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he sparks his middle pace with some effect here on the field, which seems to fit to him and beats with confidence and skill.
To choose the right man is one thing to choose the right time another.
Maybe that's the actual art of selection.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn't mean that Shah may not be well there if, as the Ceylon tea set suggests, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first bus loads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced persons whose money or visas have expired, and others who hoped that the city would return to normality.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels they had expelled from their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before 800 people from Damascus arrived in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operational with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after they had killed many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has ceased to kill people," he said, regarding the militia of the militant clergyman Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered to put his forces back at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the vast Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the Iraqi regime did not allow him to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local militia supported by the United States has helped to expel Al-Qaida from their bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe, who had been expelled from his house in Sleikh in the north of Baghdad by an attack on hand grenades after having invited his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaida.
He came back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started the Anti-Al-Qaida militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and those of my boys.
That's why I returned today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many told them that they had been attracted by the increasing peace in the capital since the rise in U.S. troops and the growth of local "groups affected citizens", which armed and defended their districts in cooperation with the U.S. military.
But more talked about having been forced home by visa problems and seizing money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-year-old father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiitian Prime Minister, had requested the Syrian Government to impose visa restrictions on refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably escaped from the sectarian death squadrons in the country.
"We went well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government forced the Iraqis to no longer give visas to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni retired.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left."
One of the reasons for the decline in violence is that Sunnien was expelled from Shiitian residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have fallen.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will relaunch sectarian tensions and conflicts will occur.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is leading in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education is the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Insular country that we are not French" - this slogan posts the smallest German state on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland education system, which is placed at five in the education monitor of the Institute of German Economy Cologne (IW).
Thus, universities are already working closely with neighbouring countries from tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can complete their studies with a double or even triple degree.
As a result, the share of foreign students is high with 15.6 per cent.
But the country children also bring the Saarland to higher than average numbers of universities - many of them without a degree in high school.
"In Saarland the vocational education system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, an educational expert at the IW.
More than every fifth young person acquires his degree in a vocational school, so the Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combination of vocational and academic training is also relatively extensive.
Measured by the population, the equipment with dual courses is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineer graduates has declined by one third in recent years.
This is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed universities to a marketing campaign for engineering.
"We started a number of reforms in general schools after the first Pisa study," says a spokesperson from the Ministry of Education.
For example, the government introduced national comparative tests.
In order to begin learning earlier, the last Kita year is free of charge - a model that is now also copying other Länder.
Whether students' performance improves sustainably will only show future comparison studies.
At Pisa in 2003, the proportion of venture students fell from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, Saarland did not increase as much as other Länder.
The Bavarians expect better.
And to the roots of the Saarlands, foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - in this area you could otherwise point.
Because the language of the neighbours is compulsory for high school - even if the Saarlands are not French.
Chávez turns the watches
In Venezuela, the clocks soon turn differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9th, President Hugo Chávez lets the timepieces in the South American country turn back for half an hour.
In Spain Chávez becomes a joke figure.
According to the Venezuelan Official Journal, a new law states that the clocks will be switched to the world’s time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that there is no other country in the world.
The U.S. enemy Chávez justified his decision, inter alia, by the fact that the United States of the world had imposed the classification into time zones for full hours.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the cessation of relations with the neighbouring country Colombia for a hostage deal.
The left nationalist said, as long as the Conservative Alvaro Uribe remains President of Colombia, he will not maintain relations with the Head of State or with the Colombian government.
"I can't do this just because of my dignity," said Chávez, who advances a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oilstorm will have to vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform he would significantly increase his power in the country.
The result of the dispute was the decision of Uribe to withdraw Chávez from the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia on the release of hostages.
Uribe had Venezuela with his decision "sucked in the face", Chávez had criticized on Sunday.
Chávez is also in all mouths in Spain.
A new phone sound in the country provides furores: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you keep your mouth) is the sentence that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
He was spoken by King Juan Carlos of Spain, who had been angry at the recent Ibero-American summit by the constant calls of the left-wing populist and had driven this over his mouth.
German threatens 2007 wage minus
In spite of the strong economic situation, German workers are forecast to be at risk of real wage loss this year.
Experts called a whole set of reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees could actually count less on the pay account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The debt of this is the modest wage development, the increase in VAT and the price cuts in food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the "image" label.
New burdens could also be imposed on workers in the case of unemployment insurance.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück said the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 per cent of the year change was correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, if the Federal Labour Agency should not be embarrassed to ask for loans or grants in the union, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday it was announced that the price explosion in food and mineral oil products has led the inflation rate to the highest level for 13 years.
Prices increased by 3.0 per cent in total year-on-year.
Venus is the Heavenly Twin of the Earth
The Venus is more similar to the Earth’s life-fearing atmosphere than it has been thought so far: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind webbing in Poland, as they occur on the Earth in winter.
For almost three decades, scientists have suspected that it is flashing on the Venus.
Now the European "Venus Express" probe has proven - it detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: the flashes on the Venus shoot at a height of about 56 kilometres from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russell from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "Ursuppen-Theory", lightning has led to life on earth: storms are supposed to have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on the Venus: "If there was ever life there, it must have been in the very early history," explains Sean Solomon from the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today there is unlikely to be something alive on the surface of the Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on earth, sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus may be the devil of the earth, but it is a twin," Russell said.
Why the Venus, which is so similar to the earth in mass and size, has hit a so completely different development, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, since since the beginning of the 1990s no probe was on its way specifically to explore this planet.
The latest research results, which are now presented in several "Nature" articles, do not only underscore the uniqueness of the Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the commonities of our neighbouring planet with the Earth are greater than initially accepted," the Esa informs.
In addition to the already known webelwind on the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud bulb on the South Pole, which turns much faster.
The phenomenon reminds of air flows on the earthly winter hemisphere, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second inner planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is almost the same size with a diameter of 12,100 kilometres.
The planet, also called morning or evening star, circles around the sun in almost 225 days.
But he turns much slower around himself: a Venustag takes 243 days on earth.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar hardly reminds the Earth, scientists assume that both planets have been created under very similar conditions.
On both, water was collected that remained on earth in oceans, but on Venus was lost in space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on earth in carbonate rocks, it makes the majority of the atmosphere on the Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler calls for an end to the party dispute for the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's Office.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for her attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the reputation of Germany and has asked the great coalition to end the fight for the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a split nation to the outside world on this issue," Köhler said to the trade paper.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding of the reception of the Dalai Lama by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity for me, even though I respect the diversity of cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany had to maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but Merkel took protection from the accusation that she was conducting a new China policy.
"The Federal Chancellor has not waived the traditional one-China policy.
China also knows that," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly shown discouragement about the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from the ranks of the Union.
Steinmeier had, among other things, complained about the Union's "supermost policy" in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lamas at the Chancellor's Office, there were severe irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
For example, the Chinese leadership has not only invited the German Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also, according to the information provided by the SPIEGEL, frozen the so-called strategic dialogue between the foreign ministers of both countries.
China's Head of Government Wen Jiabao has now asked Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the reception of the Dalai Lamas as an error.
China refuses when European politicians officially receive the Tibetan religious leader, Wen Jiabao reaffirmed the Chinese position.
The acts and words of the Dalai Lamas showed that he attempted to split Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other today's provinces, from China.
Schäuble warns against crabs like in France
Street battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against cramps as in France.
The Federal Minister called for everything to be done to ensure that social discontent in Germany is not discontented in violence on the streets.
Barricades burned, Randalier shot on the police with scrubs: After the heavy youth crawls in France, Federal Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We need to make sure that we do not build social explosives and discharge them in violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said to the "New Press" published in Hanover.
Not every young person is able to cope with the rapid change in social reality.
The federal government, countries and municipalities have already worked hard to remove problems," Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Islamic Conference, this already shows first successes."
However, it is too early for warning.
Schäuble also pointed out that in German suburbs there are no urban and sociological problems as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had spent the last few nights fighting heavy streets with the police.
Cars and public buildings also burned in Toulouse.
However, the president of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater integration efforts by the federal government.
In view of the Krawall in France, Colat warned against "imitation effects".
Although the situation in Germany is not as fragile as in France.
But there is still a need for action.
Colat pointed out that the unemployment rate for young people under 25 years of age was "over-average".
There must be more training places in particular.
Colat stressed, "We need to give young people a perspective."
The president of the Turkish community, however, added that in Germany there is more "social control in the families" than in France.
Many youths with a background of migration also did not want to destroy what their parents built up here.
Colat told me, "But yet we have to take care."
It is necessary to "swiftly give young people the opportunity to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile, it remained largely quiet in the night in the Paris suburb Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were in operation, a helicopter flew over the area with headlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning garbage and cars.
Since the day before, a call from around 1,000 security forces ensures rest.
The police will go through as long as necessary, Minister of Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburbs.
During the night on Tuesday, around 80 policemen had been injured at Krawallen in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the episode, the unrests took over on Toulouse.
The cranes ignited in a traffic accident where two young people had died on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the Attorney General, the police are not guilty of the death of young people.
In the kingdom of Angela Wolke
The reality of the Chancellor's appearance documents that the coalition is at the end of content - and that nothing can be expected of her.
In what country does this federal Chancellor actually live?
After her unconsolated appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was responsible and poor in content, you must say: not here - not in the country that would finally have to be ruled by it.
Angela Merkel rejected the claim that she was too focused on foreign policy with an abominable sentence.
That was provincial, she said, and it only showed that she did not want to understand what the critics were talking about.
In the Bundestag, she documented to all the people how much their accusations apply.
There was no concrete interest or even a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: an exalted politician fleeing into foreign policy and staying in the vicinity even there.
For example, climate protection: She praises the decisions of Heiligendamm unreasonably, but does not say how to achieve the climate targets in this country.
In general, the self-love - so much inconvenience would have failed the CDU chief two years ago.
Now she sticks to the flasks that the recovery comes from people.
So she damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems instead of talking the world nicely.
But in the kingdom of Angela Cloud, internal political problems are a marginal appearance.
Child poverty and the concerns of the low earners?
She's got a few extras left for it.
It means how often it promises itself when it comes to the child supplement.
Three runs need Merkel there to bring out a half straight sentence.
It stumbles like on a foreign ground when it becomes concrete.
Attack Division
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney have a tough blow exchange - and now have to fear an external candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already uncovered in the first theme.
He has made New York a "refugee for illegal immigrants", Mitt Romney throws his counterpart Rudy Giuliani.
This, on the other hand, contrasts with severe accusations: "I would say that his own house was a port for illegals," responds Giuliani and rejects the former Governor of Massachusetts for having employed private immigrants without papers.
The candidates are attacking: because the Republican base continues to have no clear favorites, the eight presidential candidates use the debate at CNN in particular to discredit their opponents.
The self-drawn 30-second videos sent by Internet users via YouTube are hardly more than keywords.
"With this kind of isolationism we have allowed Hitler to come to power," John McCain presents his counterpart Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round who calls for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also gets strong reading the Levites from Vietnam veteran when he refuses to condemn the so-called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation simulating drowning as torture.
The reactions of the Saal audience in St. Petersburg in Florida show that the main themes of the campaign are now beyond Iraqi war and torture debates.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, applause will be expressed in the Auditorium.
Once again, where are the weaknesses of the two favorites?
"I was wrong then," Romney explains, "and in front of the base and television audience, he bitted that he was still one of the abortion advocates in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes into the sleeve when he thinks he is asked about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules for the first time in civilians
One day after his resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani ruler Musharraf was obeyed as President.
This ends eight years of military domination in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was promised for another five years of office on Thursday.
Pakistani television passed on the ceremony in the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad live.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the benefit of the nation.
On Wednesday he had handed over his office as head of the army to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus devoured himself to international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after his seizure of power in an unblooded military coup, the former General now rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation as the commander-in-chief of the forces, Musharraf had met a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is an end to the state of exception imposed by Musharraf on 3 November.
Musharraf, according to the Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, will soon after his prosecutation lift the state of exception and thus meet another demand of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied with weighted lawyers at the beginning of November following the imposition of the state of exception, had rejected all objections to the contested reelection of the Head of State on 6 October last week.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy and four more were injured.
According to an army speaker, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of the herb rock return
Germany's supergroup of the 1970s is musicing again: the three band members of Harmonia again adopted their consoles at a concert in Berlin.
For the revival, an average of her great time "Live 1974" appears.
Even then, they were much more famous abroad.
The enclosed sensation then occurs in the form of three men set up at the evening table.
Everyone has his box in front of himself, his cables and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius thront in a white shirt with 63 years of age in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years old and owned by laptop and guitar.
On the right, from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, focuses on the console.
Everyone contributes to sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds to a conventional piece of music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band musicizes Harmonia again has provided some excitement among grass rock lovers.
Where you can reveal: Targeted demands showed that, although the name was swaying through a collective pop memory, it was not so lasting to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why shouldn't the German also be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the 1970s?
Especially what is misleading grass rock was always more common in England and America than in its own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for Lifework to the survivors of the Cologne Can Group in 2003, the German pop faces were seen in the hall.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and New in Laudatio, the surprise did not know any limits.
At concerts, Michael Rother later picked up at the Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage like an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and the declaration in the stranger is one.
The memory is already overburdened with Harmonia, because the trio existed only for two years and at that time also developed a much less effective power than it was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously musiced with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name cluster.
First, they played in the basement under the Berlin stage.
Afterwards in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had shortly helped at the power plant and then played a reputation as a guitarist at Neu!, then perhaps the most radical German group.
However, around 1973 Rother followed the cluster musician in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as a city escaped municipality.
Less ideological than in the municipality of I, where Roedelius was still allowed to plague himself as a babysitter.
Preferentially in a spicy artist's act.
It was alleged that in the blockage waste there was also a whip of the Harmonia Ottenstein singing association and a name for art.
Some kept Harmonia on it.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
Because so left and modest the music also sounded, the band suffered material distress.
The collection of rice did not only serve the self-invention.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was cut in a concert in Griessem, in front of a almost 50-headed record scene, as someone thinks to think of.
At that time Rother came to the desire to force Harmonia and to practice occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral requirement.
The band declared its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the Esoteric Spheric and secured his existence with albums like "Flaming Hearts".
Cluster was revived again in the eighties and has since been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
The Griessemer live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its plate company Greenland has set its goal to maintain the herb rock as its original German contribution to lively music.
New! has already been excavated like Roedelius Solowork.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Publicly subsidised, as part of the Woldtronics festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, Altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the Loveparade inventor Dr. Motte.
This would enshrin the entire bandwidth of the influences of the herb rock on the following pop music.
Harmonia fills out the space of the supergroup.
Brian Eno's sentence floats with the most extraordinary sounds in the hall: "The only true music, you belong to the future."
There are pictures that show the producer with harmony in the farmhouse.
The legend formation serves projections of further black-and-white photographs of wire wired devices.
Before that, the three veterans are again involved in improvisation.
No longer by sticking microphones to the organ and to the drum to distract sounds of instruments from self-plated power devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three technically deepened tufters.
The choir of the house does not change any of that.
Under the leadership of Barbara Morgenstars is housed and secured under sound clouds and singing in a beautiful place with emphase "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never rock.
The roots were sought less in Blues than in Music High Schools (Can), Technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever calls here "'68!" is not quite wrong, and harmony cannot be put out of peace even now.
Even the most natural is thoroughly reconsidered on stage.
Where does music begin and when does it stop?
This can rob your nerves or give you great happiness in fleeing moments.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Mörderischer Frieden" again two films are dealing with the Balkan War.
But both don't convince.
Either the concepts put too much on action and Geballer or they are too touchable.
Richard Gere can't help at The Hunting Party.
The good news first: Although the war criminals are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, the actor Richard Gere has been found in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man in the eighties last time, because too many nicely-important roles in well-being films for women and too many press conferences on Buddhism gave you the desire to see.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - If the hunter becomes a hunter" (Why must movie titles be as long and we like locomotive leader tariff contracts today?) perhaps.
He provides a wonderful eye-twinking presentation: In principle, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have been done if fate and the film industry were not so merciful: a man who has his best times long behind himself, but who, even as a ruin-like monument of his decline, has preserved considerable remnants of the former charm.
But in spite of this trumpet, the Hunting Party, together with the German production of "Morderary Peace", which also begins this week, only continues the endless series of failed Balkan War films.
With "Morderary Peace" you can make a short process: The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from Kosovon snipers, and one who is also in love with her quickly.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are not presented here as the sole root of all evils, the television film loses too quickly in Geballer and Action.
There remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without motorway but with war for it.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" is quite exemplary, why there has never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who open up to detect the Serbian superwar criminal "the Fuchs" could have become a new "Apocalypse Now" at another time with another director and script author (both in the Staff Union Richard Shepard).
Because the stories are strikingly similar: both times small teams go into the forest to accomplish something that the military cannot do and both times it will be a trip into the madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt is not just the downcoming cynic with heart as he is presented to us at the beginning.
No, above all, the script must have a romantic relationship with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" will go down to the stream if the reporters in the last five minutes in the time raffer process succeeded in what NATO, CIA and all the hunters of capital money have not done in five years: catch the war criminals and leave the Muslim Bosnians to a fair revenge.
This is so bad that the International Court of Justice in The Hague is called for crimes against the cinematology.
The film has a deep human concern.
He wants to accuse Karadzic and Mladic that he is still running freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (this is to be exceptionally agreed here) not to be too intense to pursue the persecution because of secret political agreements.
But the good community and the evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes into mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's desk: "With compassion, I see the swollen fronts, suggesting: how laborful it is to be evil."
Films like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such swellheads, but they indicate how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of Balkan War Film.
Recently, this newspaper reported that all Iraqi films were Hollywood's big flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa movie.
Almost always, if a star runs around the world's crisis flocks or mine fields, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond all the borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blue Diamantes" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all the conflicts are too close in time.
After all, it had to take decades before Hollywood could make a good movie about the Holocaust with the "Schindlers List".
Some films will probably still mature - the now classic Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" have not been celebrated unanimously as masterpieces at the time.
But maybe we know today where every mass murder comes home on just two screens in real time, just too much about the conflicts in the world.
And this robs the scriptwriters of the doubts it needs to tell good stories.
"Being himself or none" or "The great dictator" have finally become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin didn't know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Maybe you have to have the sarcastically distanced artist view of the Romanist Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was questioned about parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières dictionary" and the Balkan war, he replied: "This is just because some things never change.
Great cities will always be terriblely dangerous, people will always be murdered in a horrific way and war will always prevail in Yugoslavia."
Criticism for Olympic Resignation harvested by Beust
The bridge of the mayor from Hamburg’s application for Olympic Summer Games has been severely criticised by politics and the economy.
Many want to continue fighting for the games on the water.
But from Beust, realism encourages the assessment of opportunities.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, the Chief Executive Officer of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, described a renouncement on Wednesday as "not good for the place of business".
No other project has recently developed as big motivation forces in the city as the Olympic Aids.
"Without this objective, the sport policy stimulus could not be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to enter the project, but to find a new long-term approach to "which is based on a change in time".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained in previous statements on Wednesday that Hamburg's Olympia ambitions were unrealistic by at least 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said Beust World ONLINE.
He referred to the decision expected by the Sportbund on an application for the 2018 Winter Games in Munich for early December.
"This preference means for us that we will not have realistic opportunities in the period before 2028."
Nevertheless, the dream was not dreamed forever, said Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This gives the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for Olympic games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to build a chance by burying the plans already at that time," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A resignation of the application is also contrary to the statement made by the senate leader on the occasion of a reception to the general assembly of the General German University Sports Association.
There Beust described Hamburg's application for the 2015 Universiade as "not a replacement" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association had nominated Hamburg as a candidate city only last week.
The SPD Citizenship Group gave the Senate the opportunity not to use valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Small Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has placed Olympia on the map and excluded housing," said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the Small Grasbrook had always called for integrated planning for Olympia and later use of homes, the CDU had set one-sided on the "Event Factor".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg at that time had triggered a great enthusiasm.
Hamburg, however, failed in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Who combines the terms of Sweden with the wooden box, thinks about Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Right?
Currently, wooden boxes manufactured in Sweden throw dark shadows on Warhol's catalogue.
Most of the ninety-four Brillo boxes listed there are counterfeiting.
After a few months ago, the Swedish newspaper "Express" raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes of 1968, internal research at the Moderna Museum in Stockholm has now come to an aggravating result: the six "Brillo boxes" made by the former museum director Pontus Hultén to the Moderna Museum in 1995, are copies - and probably also the majority of the about 100 other Brillo boxes of the "Typ Stockholm", which are in circulation on the international art market.
The prehistory is sealed, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo boxes", painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the paperboards of the soap powder "Brillo".
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 - with Warhol's consent - produced hundreds of Brillo boxes from cardboard: these came (for cost reasons) not from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo carton factory.
It was not artwork, it was their models, it was just exhibition pieces.
At the same time, Warhol probably granted permission in 1968 to produce a few Brillo wooden cushions in Sweden, but they were not issued at the Moderna Museum.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes, which were rightly entered into the art and auction history as authorized original Andy Warhol-Brillo boxes with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have earned more than $100 000 on auctions.
The problem is now that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that it had been produced and exhibited about a hundred wooden boxes in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were produced in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg only in 1990.
At that time Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, Chefkonservator at the Moderna Museet, has also investigated three Swedish private-owned Brillo-Boxes, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their press panels were only founded and molded, and then white oil colour was applied with a brush.
On the other hand, the structure of the copies from 1990 reveals that the colour has been applied directly to the press panel with a painter roll without foundation - and it is not oil, but acrylic.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes," says Lars Nittve, director of Moderna Museet: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to another conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exposure material."
Already in July, the Authentication Board has announced that it will follow the "heavy accusations" raised in the case of soap powder boxes.
But since then you have been silent there in unreasonable silence.
Rebelling soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebellious soldiers who sneaked into a hotel in Manila and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not blame bloodshed, said the leader Antonio Trillanes, who blamed the President for corruption and election fraud, reporters in the hotel.
Government-reliable soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under tear gas operation.
The about two dozen soldiers had been in the building for hours.
Around half of them stood in court on Thursday because of a failed coup in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly stop with about 30 sympathizers.
The military officers who were supposed to guard him had apparently passed over to him and joined his melting.
They entered the Peninsula hotel and called for the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government forces locked the district around the hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the operation of the soldiers.
"The people have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who previously commanded the elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said that other army units wanted to join the march shortly.
Government critics had called for major demonstrations against the President for Friday.
Your government has been overshadowed by corruption for months.
Manila's financial district was already the main scene in 2003 of the attempted militia of around 200 military members against Arroyo.
After almost 24 hours, the revolt failed to join the army.
Since 1986, at least seven attempts have already been made against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes large shareholder at Versatel
United Internet has secured a share of more than 20 percent of Versatel's telecommunications company.
The average price per share is 14,46 euros, as the company announced on Wednesday evening.
It is now held 20.05 percent of the capital.
A acquisition had previously been speculated.
The option is open to increase the proportion of Versatel.
This step aims to promote the consolidation of the German DSL market, said United Internet.
Previously, on Wednesday, there had been suspicions of an entry after Berenberg Bank increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator by another 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The money house only considers the shares to be a third party, said in the financial market.
The previous day, United Internet had already participated in the mobile company Drillisch with almost 10 percent.
As part of a capital increase, Drillian has invested 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
5.15 million shares of them have purchased the United Internet for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, companies have started discussions on marketing cooperation for DSL and mobile products.
"We strengthen our partnership," explained a United Internet speaker.
The two companies set up the MSP Joint Undertaking to take over the competitors Freenet.
First, the two companies want to satisfy themselves with a share of more than ten percent of Freenet and do not take advantage of their right to take over another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet announced on Thursday.
However, the two companies held all options open, especially to further increase the participation in Freenet AG, said.
Discussions between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had been completed in mid-November.
The poker around Freenet, which has lasted for months and is hard to see, is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers at the end of the third quarter and 1.27 million DSL and complete closure customers.
The holding of United Internet and Drillisch has up to now held 6.01 percent of Freenet shares directly.
Now it was agreed that Drillisch would bring another about four percent.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
