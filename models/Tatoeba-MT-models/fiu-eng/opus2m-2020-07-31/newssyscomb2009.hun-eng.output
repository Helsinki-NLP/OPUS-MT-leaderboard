Victory of right-wing populists in Austria, total 29 percent
The noticeable weakening of the two parties to the great coalition so far and the significant strengthening of the populist parties on the right, according to the first preliminary findings, was the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of the current president Wilhelm Molterer has been seriously undermined, has suffered particularly severe losses.
On the other hand, the President of the Association for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Head of the Caribbean Province, Jörg Haider, is preparing to return to national politics.
Based on the preliminary results, the country's strongest party will remain the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) with 29.8 per cent of votes, but it has lost 5.5 per cent of votes compared to the last 2006 elections.
The ÖVP was even worse, which loses nearly 9 percent of the votes by 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of both major parties in the post-war history of Austria and, in particular, of the People's Party that gave rise to the pre-elections, the result is literally disastrous.
At the beginning of July, the People's Party had a significant advantage over SPÖ in terms of public opinion polls when leaving the ÖVP coalition.
However, the voters were apparently punished for allowing the government to fail.
In the first reactions to the results, speculations have already been made about the possible resignation of Vice President Wilhelm Molterer and the current starting cell.
The observers believe that this could take place already on Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the Party.
This development is likely to facilitate the renewal of the election result, i.e. the large coalition SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) had previously gained 18 percent of the votes and the BZÖ gained 11 percent of the votes - however, the Social Democrats have expressed their fear of repeating the year 1999, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (the FPÖ was still united at the time, it was replaced by BZÖ in 2005), which even brought sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Haider, who has already declared that he is willing to cooperate with any party, and I assume that he can return to Vienna for national policy, obviously expects this solution.
The Greens Party came to Parliament, which, however, has somewhat lost its popularity, and has fallen from third place to fifth place between Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties exceeded the four-percent limit and did not enter Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Indian relations may cool
If the problem of Czech scientists for illegal beetling could not be resolved, according to Czech Minister of Foreign Affairs Karel Schwarzenberg, there could be some confusion in Czech-Indian relations.
This was published by the Minister in New York after his meeting with Pranab Mukherji, his Indian partner today.
"If this were not resolved, yes, there would be a certain chill," he said after the meeting, which was inspired by the Czech Republic.
After the trial, Mukherji said that enforcement power could be difficult to intervene in judicial matters.
However, he pointed out that, in the case of Petr Švácha, which has been dismissed and fined, the central government may negotiate with the local leadership of Darjeelin, the subject of which is the subject of the case.
"His problem could be solved," said the Minister.
However, for Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherji said it would be best to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Then you could apply to be released from bail and wait for the verdict, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself similarly during the trial.
"He offered to appeal to the Supreme Court, so it would be possible to exonerate him," said the head of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech party can intervene in the whole case is to provide the convicted with "competent legal support", the Indian minister mentioned.
At the same time, he said that the Indian party has already provided them with such help.
"Our main interest is to maintain the best connections with India with many years of inheritance.
This is acknowledged by the Indians," Schwarzenberg mentioned.
At the same time, as you have said to the CSTC, your partner stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We consider the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scientists to be a serious mistake," he said.
The question whether the Indian party promised to deal with the case was ignored by the Minister.
"I've already made a lot of promises," he said.
Czech judges in the fight for the seabed
It enters the wall's electronic map on which Australia and the neighbouring sea areas are visible.
But he doesn't care about the continent. He cares about a point in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with the neighboring seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosoosso, who is part of the United Nations Division's 30th Working Group on the Ocean and Law of the Sea.
His boss, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, is monitoring the explanation, which is sometimes supplemented.
Work and enthusiasm prevail here.
The seabed is rich in natural resources and hardly known worlds so far.
Oil, ore and other minerals can be found here, but also living organisms that have not yet been identified, for example, could be the key to developing anti-cancer medicine.
Seabeds greater than dry land
Coastal states today are intensifyingly seeking out new sub-sea areas.
According to the United Nations Convention, their rights are respected, which was agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is primarily about the area of the so-called continental stock, which often extends up to a few hundred kilometres from the coasts of that country.
Such a country shall have exclusive rights under the Convention to all sources of the continental fund.
"Simplified, we keep that part of the continental base and the layer below the seabed, which is the natural continuation of the subsea continent.
The coastal sea borders, often two hundred miles from the sea, extend beyond the borders of the economic zone," Mikulka explains.
The application submitted by that country to the Commission for the designation of the external borders of the Continental Council shall be supplemented by a number of extensive scientific and technical documentation based on costly research and measurement.
This is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is legal and professional assistance to the Committee.
So far, the Committee has discussed five requests: Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three countries have succeeded," Mikulka adds.
In the world, Australia's success has recently echoed, which has first substantially expanded its underwater country.
But New Zealand has also won - the area of the seabed that the Committee considers to be about 1.6 million square kilometers, which is six times the size of the country.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in research.
Profit resulting from the future use of the seabed is expected to be invaluable.
Other countries also submit their applications on an ongoing basis.
They can do so within ten years of ratification of the "Montego Bay Convention".
At the end of the continental scale, the area of the ocean floor declared by the Convention on the Common Heritage of Human Beings begins.
No country has an exclusive situation here.
The right of extraction in this area shall be given by the international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed, however, is not Klondike," says too much, Director Mikulka, saying that "some areas are legally defined and their regimes are laid down in contract".
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed belongs to the Czech Republic today.
He shares this former Eastern bloc with other countries within the framework of the joint "Interceanmetal" organisation.
This organisation received the status of "tourist investor" under the Convention in 1991, just like investors in some other countries.
He was entitled to produce in the ClarionClipperton zone between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati on the Pacific.
The area reviewed by the investor is slightly larger than that of the former Czechoslovakia.
It's about a copy of the Tatra under the sea.
"This can be produced in a total of 75,000 square kilometers.
The rich location of polymetalic ores containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese is mentioned by another lawyer, the Hindu Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, a member of the division Macedonian, is another example of concrete.
It reminds me of a potato or a parchment with a little fantasy with the magic words of Golem.
German special forces were present at hostage release
The Egyptian government asked Germany for help in solving the hostage crisis - and the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but their deployment was not done.
The release of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt is becoming more and more pronounced.
According to the information provided by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Interior, the rescue was directly attended by German special forces.
According to this report, in addition to the experts of the Federal Army of Germany, GSG 9, the Federal Police Air Force (GSG) and the Federal Crime Office were also members of staff and logistics experts from the German Technical Service at the point of release.
According to the information of the Ministry of Justice spokespersons on Monday night, however, the German forces were not necessary, since the hostages allowed their prisoners to run and then fled when they recognized the signs of violent hostages.
The Egyptian Government has accepted the assistance offered by Germany to involve it as a support force on the ground.
"There was no luck in this," said the spokesperson of the Federal Ministry of Interior.
The attackers were abducted on 19 September by a group of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian woman and eight Egyptian escorts in southern Egypt.
Following the kidnapping in the desert of South Egypt, the hostages were dragged around the border of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostages has so far remained unclear, as have the details of the release of the hostages or any ransom payments.
In the meantime, the refugees arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the hostages released were under the protection of the German Embassy.
He didn't say anything about release details.
For the time being, there was no information on when they would return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", the five tourists and the special forces will arrive in Germany on Tuesday on the plane of the German Air Forces Airbus.
The U.S. Assembly is rejecting the rescue package.
The U.S. Congress's lower house failed, by a small majority, the $700 billion rescue package proposed for the financial markets.
Dow Jones fell deep.
The U.S. House of Representatives did not vote 206 against the Government's rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite the appeals made by American President George W. Bush and the leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority in the programme that was intended to stop the chaos on the financial markets.
The supporters desperately tried to convince the critics of the need for a $700 billion package during a dramatic operation.
Barney Frank, one of the negotiating leaders of the Democratic Party, called on the Members to support it, even if the plan was still unpopular.
"There is no need for political support to avoid something that has not even happened," he said.
Dow Jones was still down by more than 6 percent and 600 points during the vote.
The investors were concerned that the state rescue package might fail.
The index rose shortly before the vote ended, so that it would fall again after failure to be published.
Experts are still experiencing serious shocks on international financial markets.
In order to enter into force of the programme, approval of both the Assembly and the Senate is required.
Directors register more and more reservations.
It's a good winter for the German tour operators.
According to a study, for the next few months, the traffic of travel reservations increased significantly compared to the previous year - by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak cyclical outlook, the Germans did not find themselves in the study's interest in travel.
In winter reservations, travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in traffic compared to the previous year's period - the German Travel Association (DRV) announced in Berlin on Monday.
According to the GfK Market Research Institute, the number of reservations for autumn months is also higher.
The October turnover of travel agencies was around 11 per cent higher than October 2007, reported by the DRV.
These results are based on GfK data, which evaluates the monthly booking data of 1200 German travel agents and then extrapolates it to the whole market.
The Institute took into account the travels booked until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak exchange rate, travels to the USA in particular were sought - DRV stated.
Here, the number of reservations increased round by one third.
The most popular destinations of the Germans are Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the domestic landscapes.
Mostly organized roads were looking for - said Klaus Laepple, president of the DRV.
Due to rising energy and food costs, the costs for organised roads "can be calculated better for passengers than for individually organised trips."
Passengers can save money with, among other things, reservation discounts or all inclusive offers - he added Laepple.
The booking rate for the summer months was also very good, so it will be possible to record traffic growth again compared to the previous year - although another study indicates that fewer German tourists have undertaken travel than in the previous year.
My First Oktober Painting
Uninterrupted ballermann hits, literate stems and design dirndlit celebrities.
Debut in Wiesnen.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I are actually not much alike.
She's a blonde, TV show manager, and she's wearing a scaled dirndi.
I'm a dark girl with my hair, and I bought my clothes in the turquoise.
But one thing connects us: We've been on Wiesnen for just three minutes, we've already been rushed by photographers and filled their memory cards - very flattered, and all this on my first visit to Wiesnen.
That's how we make friends.
It seems the cheap Dirndli will do their job.
As a local Wiesn tourist from the white sausage to the north, my comfort area is still bordering on the population.
But when you arrive at Theresienwies, it's not that bad.
Almost everyone wears shorts or leather pants; no one looks smiling or awkward - everything is fine.
A strange look at the chocolate banana stand is just my dirndli apron.
A woman in Munich draws my attention to the fact that I mistook the apron: "You're left-handed, in the middle of a virgin, you're right-handed, widowed in the back."
I secretly tied the bow from the back to the left.
"That's good," say and laugh.
Others make less noise around fine flirting and carry a simple filter base with "I'm too drunk to get dressed" and uncomplicatedly displaying their naked backs.
The young man with exhibitional traits is called Bob, and he also visited Oktoberfest for the first time.
What you find very fantastic is long stretching the "aaaaa."
He'll tell me all this after he's gotten rid of the contents of his past drink.
Right next to one of the firecrackers everyone sees as garbage.
So Bob's one of the famous "nosed waterers."
Others are not so lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, the ambulances are going through the scene and taking care of the poor couple.
Patient nurses always appear on the team — four carry a covert stretcher from tent to tent at once.
This works as for most Wiesn visitors: Arrival empty, departure is packed.
Who's lying in the liquor basket under the pony, it doesn't seem.
"These are the ones who are completely ready," shouted one of the heroes to my question, and then in the round.
The police named the victim of the accident.
The police named the 63-year-old woman who was hit by a vehicle in Essex County and hospital.
The Brentwood resident, Chelmsford Road resident, Carole Paulson, had an accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road, in the city.
She was moved to a hospital called Queen's Hospital in Romania, but she died later.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested with suspicion of reckless driving.
Since then, he's been released for bail.
Turkey's enlarged diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey intended to join the European Union, the European powers were inspired by the desire to enter the Turkish back country deeply.
On the east side of Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps from the European border, is one of the greatest relics of a failed imperial ambition.
The Hydrapasha railway station is designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in a neorenest style.
At least that's what the travel books write.
The building encircles the end of the platforms, with a tower on each front corner, and it looks like a German rural town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building's a little down.
However, in view of the interior of the ticket shop, it is obvious what large-scale company this was the most Western gate.
The station was opened by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation in August 1908.
Germany, through this Damascus through Baghdad, the 'the late future' of the conquests, with the help of today's railway to Saudi Arabia, intended to achieve its ambitions for the capture of the Middle East.
German conquest efforts collapsed during World War I.
His railway lines were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and the Arab partisans.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The British colonial army has left Egypt and has driven the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
The Hydepasha station was no better.
In 1917 an ammo train exploded and destroyed the building's well-prepared top.
Turkish sources say there's been a sabotage operation.
Since then, it has slowly been destroyed and history has gone a long way beyond it.
At the same time today, as the gate of the Anatoly and the railway to the entire eastern region - in a symbolic sense at least - serves as a expanding diplomatic horizon for Turkey.
The Party of Truth and Development in the Government - the ACP - has developed a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The new policy is marked by commitment.
It is remarkable that the Turkish Government is in good relations with Israel and Syria, with the groups of Hamas and Fatah in Palestine, Iraq, Iran and, of course, the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to assess the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I boarded a night train to the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the ACP, the Turkish MP, Suat Kiniklinglu.
The next morning, after about ten and a half hours of escalating, which at the time gave me the rhythm of the famous documentary "The Night Mail" about the old world, I arrived in the Turkish capital. The new city is intended for the symbol of the new secular state, which turns its back on the past.
However, the AKP, with well-known Islamic roots, represents a paradigm change in the Turkish consensus.
This has created some suspicions in the West, especially in Washington.
I took a cab to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern, made of stone and steel, specifically for this purpose - which is in a developing suburban district, between semi-prepared shopping malls and coffee houses. In the latter, the middle leaders of suits - both men and women - met early in the morning to make a deal.
Suat Kiniklu would have joined a right-centred politician in any other European country.
He wore a suit, a tie, and I'm sure he even had a Blackberry.
"The party's foreign policy aim is to help Turkey reintegrate into the immediate environment.
The Cold War upset the order," he said.
Turkey is isolated from its country of origin.
Today he had to turn east and west at the same time.
You couldn't choose between two.
He had to open in both directions.
"But is it possible that he'll be forced to vote sooner or later?" I asked.
"Turkey never wanted to get in the way."
He then stressed what almost everyone I was talking to here, almost mechanically repeated: Turkey, not only its relations with the Middle East, but also with the countries surrounding the Caucasus and the Black Sea, has the same advantage for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
It is as if they are trying to convey the message that, in a forward sense, together with Turkey, the whole of Europe can reach Asia and the Middle East along those railway lines to the east.
When I was back at the Hydrapasha station, I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conura, the two German gentlemen who watched the restoration of this beautiful building 100 years ago.
How they would have wondered if they had learned that the ambitions of Europe in the Middle East are now largely in the hands of Turkey.
And as I waited for the ferry at the port to take me back to the Bosporus, I remembered that at that time Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe".
At least there was no question at that time as to which part of the land would be demanding this exciting country.
Memorial Lifeways: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown wrote: "Tod" Handley (Nekrologg, September 11) led the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir as the music director of Guildford since 1962.
Based on her music plans for the part of the city, she founded Proteus her wonderful youth choir the following year.
In principle, only under 21 years of age could have belonged to the chorus, but when Proteus sang his finale in 1979, many of us had already been at the end of our 20s - we simply refused to get away from the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the name of the mythological shape changer) was in line with the chorus' determination and ability to cope with any bag they put in front of - be it the Madrigal or a Messiah piece; without escort or with the great band temptation.
The music diversity of such a young chorus was often astounding and always exciting, and we owe it to the man whose inspiration for music remained unchanged over the years.
How often Tod told us to "let the music speak on its own."
He always said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the bag.
So sing it."
She was always fully understood and accurate, but never dictatorical or over-emphatic.
Whatever the level of music was, he always raised me on it.
John Frayn Turner wrote about him:
If you've ever lived as a conductor who was supposed to be hit as a knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I was well acquainted in the two decades during which he led the Guildford Philharmonics from 1962 to 1982.
In the last 40 years, I wrote criticisms about her more than 100 concerts, but she never disappointeds me with one and often cheers me up with them.
Tod Handley had all the greatness and modesty together, which is very rare.
He hated the citadels who, living with his words, simply "galled with a well-known battle all over the world."
Many of us will miss it.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to your necrologue of William Woodruff (September 25), "in 1946, he continued his economic history studies in Oxford, and in 1950 he became the scholarship of the Houblon-Norman research institute... while he was constantly preparing for his basic degree, master's degree and PhD title."
It comes from the author's notes of Woodruff's "Beyond Nab End" work, but it's wrong.
Between 1946 and 1953, he completed his economic history at the University of Nottingham and, under the leadership of Professor J. D. Chambers, graduated PhD on the British rubber industry, which he then published in 1958 under the title "The British rubber industry".
In 1950-51, he was in the USA with a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, New York and Harvard.
In 1953 he left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
There's no way to know why Woodruff decorated this period of his career.
J.Vente Resino on the Philosopher's arm
I recommend the exhibition "J.Vente Resino" "Flamenco and Lifesnim" because his black-white, documentary-style photos are impressive.
The simplicity and strength that flowed from them, as well as respect for the people in the photographs, have drawn my attention to them.
This exhibition is transmitted by emotions.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second sale record at Honda
In November, Honda will start marketing second-generation Jazz.
True, his predecessor has already had a large passenger space, but the development of the new model’s internal area is even more extensive.
This is combined with sophisticated mechanics, making driving more comfortable and increasing fuel savings.
Evolution versus revolution.
That's how the second generation Honda Jazz looks.
Although the new Jazz is very similar to his predecessor, many internal changes have been made.
These include, for example, innovative design, new bodywork, larger sizes and new mechanics.
But before we go over to the detailed description of the new model, we have to say that the new Jazz has been released six years after the first generation was placed on the market.
So first of all, it is clear that Honda managed to renew this model in a shorter time than other producers.
In Europe, Jazz is less known, but it sets sales records in other markets.
Such a market, for example, Japan, where Jazz was the most sought car brand in 2002 and then in 2008.
In Japan, for example, almost a million copies of Jazz have been sold since being placed on the market.
The second market was the Old Continental, with an example of nearly half a million in six years.
However, Honda wants to further increase traffic in the area with the new Jazz.
That is, while in 2007 the Japanese company sold 83,000 Jazz, estimates for the sale of 100 000 cars in 2009 will lead to an increase of 17% in the European market.
Since 2002, Honda has sold 8000 Jazz on the Spanish market, representing 6,7% of Honda’s total turnover in Spain.
In the case of the new generation, the Spanish subsidiary’s managers calculate 2000 of the examples sold during a year.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly mitigate the decline in Honda's traffic in Spain.
The company's representatives predict 22.000 copies sold by the end of this year, which is 4000 less than the 2007 data, i.e. a 16% decrease.
Despite the sales conditions, Honda increased its market share in Spain, which rose to 1.8% last year.
I would also like to increase this rate to 2% by 2010.
Honda hopes to achieve this by introducing a new model.
This would be the Insight, a five - door and compact size - 4370 mm long - hybrid, of which the Japanese company would sell 20,000 copies a year worldwide.
According to the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the Insight market distribution would be made by the United States, while the remaining share would be distributed between the Old Continental and Japan.
The introduction of Insight is due to take place in the first months of the year following the official demonstration of valence scheduled for January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz became more extensive in every way.
The length reaches 3900 mm (5 cm long), a width of 1690 mm (2 cm wide), and an axis length of 5 cm increased, i.e. 2500 mm.
However, the height remains 1520 mm.
In addition to the sizes, the passenger compartment has become more extensive.
The larger interior is guaranteed, on the one hand, by the new body and, on the other hand, by the fuel tank in the middle - this solution is already known from the previous Jazz.
In addition, the full load of the so - called double - floored container has increased by 399 litres, i.e. by 19 litres the capacity of the first generation.
Although this implies that these sizes apply to the type with an engine of 1.4, since the package holder of the 1.2 Honda Jazz is 379 litres.
Some external changes can also be discovered, for example, the easier accessibility of rear-end lamps or optional panoramic roofs, as well as rear seats.
In addition, the opening angle of the rear seats was raised to 80 degrees, against the first Jazz 67 degree angle.
The second generation Jazz engines are new.
At the start of its operation, this small model can be ordered with two engines of 1,2 and 1.4 litres.
Thanks to the i-VTEC technology, both resources use is more favourable than their previous model, as are lower CO2 emissions and excellent mechanical co-ordination, while the engine provides high performance in all respects.
The power of the 1.2 litre resource is 90 horsepower at 6000 speeds, and its maximum torque is 114 Nm at 4900 speeds.
This engine, which was 78 horsepower in the previous Jazz, consumes 5.3 litres and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
The other engine, which produced 83 horsepower in the previous generation, now reaches 100 horsepower.
The 100 horsepower Jazz consumes 5.4 litres on average and has 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
The colliding "car"
For the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan is now an inspiration from nature, precisely from the world of bees.
The Japanese company has designed a robot that prevents accidents by mimicking bees.
The Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C may be the first step in developing collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. Advanced Technical Centre have built this small robot in Japan in collaboration with the advanced scientific and technological research centre of Tokyo University.
Kazuhhiro Doi, Director of Technology PR and Research Development, has defined BR23C as a further extension of Nissan's four-level safety cover.
The robot makes the company’s products’ ability to avoid collisions more complete.
During the flight, each bee develops its oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety guard.
However, the role of the complex eye of the bee is far more important, with which it sees it at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions. Consequently, it can fly uninterruptedly in its own personal space.
In order to copy the complex eye function, engineers have designed a so-called Laser Camera (Laser Range Finder).
The instrument shall identify the obstacles in a 180-degree field of vision before BR23C within a distance of up to 2 metres, calculate their distance and send a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which shall immediately be converted into an operation to avoid impact.
"As the obstacle occurs, the small robot, mimicking the bee's movements, immediately changes direction by moving wheels at a smaller or larger angle to avoid impact.
The system is most distinguished from the instruments currently available, that in this case the avoiding manoeuvre is fully automatic.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
In other ways than bees, the avoiding maneuver shall not aim upwards or downwards, nor shall it move vertically, only in two dimensions, and only in the direction of the reverseability of the wheels, i.e. not in an infinite direction and in the way in which the bees are used.
Therefore, in addition to speeding and slowing, Nissan used a rotational function to avoid collisions.
"This structure only needs to process and respond to data every few seconds.
There is no need for data storage or intuitive logic based on previous manifestations, so it can operate without interruption only with a few dozen KB memories.
It may sound surprising, but it's not gigabyte, but it's not even megabyte-sized memories we're talking about.
This is the first step towards the development of instant collision prevention technology, which, according to Nissan's estimates, may be involved in serial cars within 10 years.
The robot operates with lithium polymer batteries that are easier and more durable than the lithium-ion variant.
In the future, the integration of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system may be an additional opportunity to get the driver to the end by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Fear of a mortgage
We must admit that the U.S. Treasury department has a lot of money that can be invested, and they're not sane.
Because of the crisis on their necks and the fact that the Americans do not question the abuses of marketable credit banks, they have created a fun and informative online game called "Bad Credit Hotel".
It's "The Hotel of Bad Loans"... or the Galibas.
The description of the accommodation and especially the receptional búmő suggests that we should consider once again, twice, and, rather, three times, whether the time has actually come for taking the credit.
And especially where to claim credit, because that's probably the purpose of the thing.
The information on the website is really useful, but it is not detailed enough.
It's more for teenagers than for the general public.
But what would happen if we were to supplement the game?
For example, the hotel would show up in the room of our dreams.
Actually, it's something, because we don't even want to dream about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens up capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced that it would provide equity to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). The largest Japanese bank will pay $9 billion for 21% of the company's capital after the Morgan Stanley stock exchange has fallen on the stock market.
One week after the preliminary agreement was published, the two banks said that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s share capital at a unit price of $25.25, i.e. a total of $3 billion.
The accepted price is more than 19% below the book value of the securities on 31 August.
MUFG will invest another $6 billion in the purchase of transferable securities, which will provide it with a 10% return and a conversion rate of $31.25.
According to Morgan Stanley, an average price of $29 is used for the implementation of the global transaction, which is 28% higher than the current exchange rate.
However, Morgan Stanley's stock price decreased by 6.79% at 17 o'clock in the middle of the greenwichi period, closing at $23.07.
"This strategic alliance offers Morgan Stanley a great opportunity to speed up the transformation into a bank holding company," explains John Mack, CEO of the US corporate group.
Morgan Stanley approved the new status last week to diversify its activities, while being controlled by the Federal Reserve.
The agreement with MUFG reaffirms that the current financial crisis calls for even greater caution from the corporations recorded on Wall Street.
In addition, the conditions announced on Monday show that the agreement has been amended in recent days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that it would sell 20% of its shares to the Japanese company for around $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, we thought that the share would consist entirely of ordinary shares," explained Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG in Tokyo.
"However, due to the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimise and avoid possible risks."
In terms of the weighted average price, MUFG pays more than 7% of the book value for Morgan Stanley shares.
As a result of the transaction, the return on a share will decrease by approximately 20%.
The agreement allows MUFG to convert half of its senior shares into ordinary shares in one year if the latter’s trading rate for a given period exceeds the exchange rate by more than 50%, i.e. around USD 47.
Morgan Stanley thus ensures that the funds from MUFG can make use of its investment opportunities, improve its balance sheet and increase its liquidity resources.
However, the group spokesperson did not want to provide precise information on the two new allies' strategic plans.
Following the MUFG’s association, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its Tier I solvency rate by about 15%, which will make one of its best in its own sector.
Morgan said that his balance sheet has been improved since the end of August.
Over the last few weeks, the group has been faced with a great challenge, as the stock price fell to half, while the cost of insurance against non-payment risk has gone to the sky.
This cost was moderated on Monday, but remained high at around 12%.
Of the large investors, one was left with the Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and after the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, which announced last week that he had made $15 billion: part of this is from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett Group.
Rafael Correa Monday's statement, Quito
The reconstruction of the Republic in the spirit of socialism in the 21st century.
This is a common plan for Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Raphael Correa.
Following the example of his fellow presidents and friends, Correa explained his ideas about the new constitution on Sunday.
His mission was successful, as 64% of the voters voted yes according to the official results of the referendum, which relate to 80% of the votes.
According to this, 28% of the population voted 'no', 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% were given by the voters.
The draft Constitution was adopted by 50% + 1 vote.
On Sunday, two surveys at the exit of the polling offices and both counting by a civil society organisation have demonstrated a huge excess of 'yes' votes with a 63% and a 70% ratio.
By the way, Rafael Correa was already talking about the victory of his draft constitution on the night of Sunday to Monday.
"The Constitution has won an overwhelming victory," he said, and from Quito, 280 kilometers southwest of Guayaquil, at the governor's seat, he thanked the people of Malaysia.
As well-known, Mr Correa Chávez, Mr Morales and President of Chile congratulated Michelle Bachele.
According to the report of the OAS mission, the vote took place in a calm atmosphere.The main topic was a 444-point text that incorporated the principles of "new socialism" protected by the President.
The proposed Constitution confers on the economy the power of the state to plan development on a country which essentially lives from oil extraction by foreign companies and the currency sent by migrants.
The draft Constitution of Correa, which was elected in 2006, confirms the power of the Head of State, who can obtain a mandate for up to two consecutive years and have the right to disband the Parliament.
Correa has already announced that she wants to make use of this opportunity and will again compete for the Head of State's mandate in February 2009.
Besides, the Constitution also included free health services and education, and the President has already started introducing it in a country with 13.9 million inhabitants and half of the population lives below the minimum standard of living.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country, which could put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of the Addiction Facility as the basis for American anti-drug measures.
Released 19 hostages in Chad
The Egyptian commando attacked the kidnappers, who took 11 tourists and their eight escorts hostage ten days ago.
The hostages are now in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts were held in the desert for ten days, from which they were transported unharmed to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
The hostages were released during the morning by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently, they arrived on an aircraft at the Al-Maza military base around 4:30, which is directly linked to the international airport of Cairo.
The hostages were forbidden to make a statement to the press and immediately transported to a hospital in the suburbs of Maadi, Cairo, where they were examined.
The hostages are "healthy" and the kidnappers were "not paid ransom" - said the Egyptian minister of tourism at the airport Zoheir Garanna.
On September 19 the hostages were taken captive at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they attended the safari on the SUV.
The group had 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and a Romanian woman) and eight Egyptians: two tour drivers, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Agyptian travel agency for the safarite.
According to information from an Egyptian security officer, a 30-member special commando has arrived on two helicopters at the scene where they were hit right before the flood on the hostage doors.
Half of the kidnappers were killed, the others escaped, said the leader who called for his name to be silenced.
He also said that a total of 150 special teams were sent from the Egyptian Flash Squad to Sudan, where German and Italian commandos were added.
The Italian diplomatic leader in Belgrade, Franco Frattini, stressed the role of secret agents and special Italian action groups.
"We must recognise that this result could not have been achieved without the professional and effective intervention of our secret services and action groups," he said without further details.
In addition, he denied that a ransom would be paid for the hostages.
On the previous day, the Sudanese army announced that during patrols they arrested a SUV on which the kidnappers traveled. Six of them were killed (including the Chadian leader) and two were arrested.
According to the military, the hostages were associated with a rebel organisation in Darfur, the Sudanese Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which was immediately disproved by the organization concerned.
Lettres - "the silent majority" of culture
The focus of the news and the election campaign is currently on the financing of culture.
That's the only thing we can be happy about.
But one piece of our cultural life will continue to be forgotten.
Who will raise his word to illustrate the ridiculous amounts of money generated by small museums, archives, archaeological diggers and national historical monuments on the edge of hunger?
What is the political sea that reminds the federal government that he does not care about his monuments and the buildings that form part of the cultural heritage?
Or that neither Quebec nor Canada have any laws that really guarantee the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French Government only spent three and a half million euros on the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
And the constitution of our neighbours in America states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture and that this heritage must be protected in a coordinated manner by all citizens, all elected representatives and all government bodies.
Within the framework of the Federation of Quebec Historical Societys (Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Quebec), more than 40,000 volunteers from 211 companies dealing with history, cultural heritage, archives and genetics are involved in research into history, as well as in the preservation of a large number of private archives and archaeological findings, with a minimum budget.
Often, these organizations defend our heritage with their teeth, and protest with the last power of drowning, when real estate developers and decision makers direct their bulldozers to our old buildings and forgotten cemeterys.
When will anyone stand up for the protection of historical and cultural heritage?
State a part of Fortis bank of the Benelux governments
With partial nationalisation, the Benelux States are helping, as a first European, the Belgian-Delg Bank, Fortison, with a total of EUR 11.2 billion in support of the financial and insurance institution with Hungarian interests.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and the Dutch Governments agreed at the highest level at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition authority.
In the euro area, the Fortis bank is the first major crisis in the wake of a crisis in the international money market which has been ringing for more than a year, and the decisions taken on the bank's case can therefore be considered to be somewhat precedentd.
According to the decision made on Sunday night, all three states buy half (49 %) of the bank’s existing property.
The Bank will certainly sell some of its interests, including, above all, the activities purchased from the Dutch ABN Amro last year, mainly insurance.
The shares of Fortis started to fall steeply last week, and during the second half of the week serious crises occurred at the Institute.
However, analysts agree that the bank is too large to allow it to fail with its 85,000 employees.
The company's papers only fell by about 12 percent on Friday, 14 years old.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
In terms of current stock prices, the total market value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the company managers this is not realistic.
The management of the company has, by the way, caused out-of-sea uncertainties in the market regarding the adoption of the USD 700 billion package plan for Fortis shares to fall.
On Monday, the papers were slightly up.
On Friday, a new CEO was appointed to the bank.
The financial institution has also been looking for private buyers, but no one has applied so far with a substantial offer.
The Belgian Government has already indicated that investors do not have to worry, do not lose their money.
Until now, no panic has occurred among bank clients, and the accounts have not been rushed.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate account and also purchased leasing companies.
Fox in the henhouse
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract with the applicant based on people’s drug purchase data.
Data protection professionals fear that the data market will become uncontrolled.
"There is a data protection programme that binds the use of prescription data in all cases to the consent of the person concerned.
This has to be in an independent hands, or we'll leave the fox in the henhouse," says Richard Dick, the developer of the drug program for tracking prescriptions in Washington Post.
Insurance companies depend on the health of the applicant client on the insurance premium and the amount to be paid in the event of damage, and if they consider the risk to be too high, they do not make insurance with it.
The person was sent to a medical examination and the contract was concluded only in the light of the outcome of the examination.
Dick has found a much cheaper procedure for ten years: from the pharmacy's identification number, he easily acquires what medicines he's been buying for the last year and a half, and the program itself concludes what disease he's suffering from and what his health status is.
For example, if you take a high dose of cholesterol regularly, it suggests that your blood fat levels are practically unmanageable, which is immediately classified in a higher risk category.
There are several versions of the programme on the market, some of which also specify a risk factor, so the insurance company has little to do outside the paperwork, although minor difficulties arise.
The disadvantages include that some medicines may be used for several purposes, such as migraines or hot flushes, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter is a significant risk-enhancing factor for business insurers, and they are not.
Special companies were formed to request and process the data, and before receiving the necessary information from the pharmacies, they asked the patient for their consent.
They are now obliged by the authorities, although they have not been punished for their failure so far.
Some companies have also recently processed the results of laboratory studies and are linked to drug consumption data, so that they can provide a more accurate picture of patients’ health status.
More and more companies have access to the data and, at the same time, it becomes increasingly difficult to control the use.
There is a separate health protection law, but only applies to healthcare providers and insurance companies.
Before the convention, there is a legislative proposal which also confers control over firms specialising in reporting.
Dick Richard understands that this is not enough: he has therefore developed his programme, which would link the transmission of the data to the express consent of the data subject.
The second question is that the person concerned is not allowed to deny the consent, otherwise the insurers will not enter into a contract with him.
So the chickens are all referred to the good will of the fox.
Global Martian Menu
Doubles trade between the European Union and India
As the mutually leading trading partners of the European Union and India, the agenda for the ninth summit has also been dominated by this issue, alongside the rest of the global problem.
Today there will also be a French-Indian summit, where nuclear cooperation will be the most important.
Although the European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic power that should be given greater say in international matters, Member States have not yet managed to reach a common denominator to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This issue was thus not hit at the 9th summit in Marseille yesterday.
Mr Sarkozy, French President of the Union, as well as President of the Union and Mr Barroso, and Mr Solana, High Representative for Foreign Affairs, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister of Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed to double in five years, i.e. to increase trade flows to a large amount of EUR 100 billion.
Given the rise in trade from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an overambitious objective.
In this sense, the twenty-six bilateral civil aviation conventions with India have been brought together in a legal sense, i.e. air traffic could fly in the future.
India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the conciliation.
The aim is to balance that while the EU is India's number one trading partner, New Delhi is only the ninth in the EU's list of partners.
The summit focused its attention on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism - the latter from both parts - were condemned in all forms and called for the UN Conference to be convened.
They also called for the end of the Doha trade round, although both have a large part of the failure so far.
The EU has confirmed that it will maintain its energy and climate programme, i.e. it would like to reduce harmful emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India has agreed with this, as has been the case for a global agreement at the next climate conference, to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
I would also like to prevent the rise in food prices and they supported an international meeting to review the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is going to the French capital today, where at the bilateral meeting he is going to conduct a business on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, they are confident that French companies will be ordered to build Indian nuclear reactors worth 20 billion euros.
According to information from the Agency, the agreement would last for 15 years.
More than three hundred Italian book publishers in Frankfurt
Italian publishers represent themselves with a strong field at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishing houses will be present at the most significant international copyright meeting at the 60th Buchmesse fair.
This year's Frankfurt International Book Fair is expected to have 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries in 171.790 square meters, where more than 403,000 books will be presented.
At the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion, the Italian Government will be represented by Francesco Maria Giro, the State Secretary of the Ministry of Culture of Java and Activities: Italy will have 264 square meters of exhibition area by setting up a single Italian Point.
The ceremony opening will be followed by a press conference in Buchmesse 5.0's "Room Structure" room, where data, trends and prospects will also be presented on the situation of Italian book publishing.
According to data, the share of foreign authors in the Italian publishing market is constantly decreasing, particularly in the field of adult and youth publications.
They found the missing billionaire Steve Fossett's plane a year ago.
They found the remains of the billionaire Steve Fossett's plane, who disappeared from the Nevada desert on September 3, 2007.
The wreckage was found on a 3,000 - foot - high upskirt, near Mammoth Lakes in the Sierra Nevada, bordering California and Nevada.
No human remains were found inside the plane.
John Anderson, the sheriff of the county of Madera, dissociated all remaining doubts: "We sent out a team after establishing the position of the plane, and we can now be sure that this is about the plane on the day Steve Fossett went missing", he said at a press conference.
The sheriff also confirmed that no human remains were found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Agency (NTSB) stated that, a few hours after the wreck was discovered, an investigation committee was asked to identify the plane and to find that it was indeed the Bellanca 8kcab that disappeared on 3 September 2007, on the day Fossett took a three-hour flight from Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, also in California, not far from the Nevada border, a couple found some of Fosset's personal items near Mammoth Lakes' home.
Two IDs for Fosset issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Control, some cash and a sweater.
His search for Fossett was given a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire set up many peaks that allowed him to enter history.
In 2002, on the sixth attempt, he first managed to fly around the earth with a balloon: two weeks of lonely flying.
Three years later, he was flying around the ground without landing.
Its many records include the flight over the Andes, at 15.445 feet [15.445 m], which he performed with a second pilot.
GLK, shocking advertising
An unusual, yet original, and definite form of hobby, with large surfaces and clean corners.
In a few words, this is the latest "compatible SUV" of Mercedes-Benz, which the German car factory has tried to bring fresh impetus to the market.
It is precisely because of this content other than traditional that will be surprising and unusual for SUV GLK's introductory campaign in Mercedes-Benz from 17 October.
The commercial campaign accompanying the introduction of the new vehicle is based on an unknown media communication tool, including utopian 3D posters that have not been used by the car brand in Italy.
The giant poster action, which consists of three stages, will dominate the shopping street of Milan by 15 November, the Corso Como.
The first phase of this new type of media communication begins with the spatial presentation of the car, with the new special glasses distributed around SUV, Corso Como, which will be displayed in almost real sizes and in three-dimensional form.
The viewer will feel like the car is getting out of the poster.
After that, using the innovative Elumina8 technology, every detail of the new GLK will be visible so that it can be combined in a uniform way.
There is no doubt that Mercedes is trying to introduce something new to this promotion into the stereotype advertising world of the automotive industry.
Is it possible to raise the interest of future customers?
We'll show you who the Italian football hooligans are.
Young people from Trivenet, probably excluded from the fields.
But who is this 150-200 boys and girls, who are now ashamed of the whole of Italy? members of the group "Ultras Italia", who has been following the team for years and which, in truth, has not caused too much trouble so far.
They never bumped into the opponent's fans.
The core of the group is on the right.
The lead organizers are coming from Trivento.
And Verona, Padova, Triest, and Udine.
These have been joined in Sofia by smaller scattered groups (in fact only a few units) from Campania and Puglia.
Italian flags were flying on which the home city of the fans was marked: on Saturday they were taken off so that they could not be identified.
They follow the example of English fans.
In Bulgaria, they faced a real Nazi cheering team with the Levski Drunkers.
The Italian football association made 144 tickets available to Italian fans. These were tickets for names, making it easier to control the cheerleading team.
The Ministry of Interior also checked everyone out: there was no one in progress among those preparing for Sofia, no one who would have been banned from visiting the stadium.
Four Italian fans with a record of football were denied the ticket and the trip.
At the moment, the Ministry of Interior is waiting for the minutes from the Sofian police to take the necessary measures: those who have been arrested or identified during the riots may be subject to a five-year ban.
It is an international ban, which applies not only to the visit of Italy but to all the stadiums in Europe.
So our football hooligans can't put their feet on any football course.
Fortunately.
However, we must also fear that the hooligans will find followers, that is to say that few hundred and fifty people will be joined by others.
"However, this fire must be strangled, not apologised to the person who acts like this," said the Ministry of Interior.
So we'd better keep an eye out, especially since we're getting closer to Wednesday's selected match day, Lecca.
In Puglia, there is a small cell that supports the Italian ultras.
Tomorrow, the Monitoring Service will meet, and Tuesday, the Security of Sports Events Committee, which can count on a section of the Home Security Service, will be held in secret services dealing with the conduct of supporters.
"Duce-Duce's scandal and flying arm under the Italian hymn?
He expressed this idea in a rather unfortunate way, Domenico Mazzilli, who was appointed to serve as an observer at the Ministry of the Interior a few weeks ago (the post was taken by Francesco Tagliante, and before that was taken by Felice Ferlizzi).
Before that, Mazzilli was chief of police, Triest, the city where a cell has been working since 2002 to support the Ultras Italy group.
What Mazzilli says is true is not prohibited in Bulgaria, but the behavior of that 150-200 fan was shameful.
I'm not a sociologist, he's the first man on the surveillance service, but crimes must be judged in the country where they were committed.
Until now, this group has not caused any problems; we need to examine exactly what has happened and consider how to continue.
But let's talk a little bit about the whistling of the Italian hymn: it's not a crime, but, if I may say so, it can't be called well-being."
