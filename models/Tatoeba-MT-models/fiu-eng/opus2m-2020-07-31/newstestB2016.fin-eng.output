Found a 9-year-old boy on the run in Tampere.
The police have been on a search mission for a 9-year-old boy's runaway in Tampere on Tuesday night.
The missing report on a boy who left the West Tampere with his friend has spread to social media.
According to the police station, the boy has been contacted, and there is no risk of life and health.
The boy's father told Ilta-Sanom half-night, knowing he's been found.
He's fine, and now we're gonna start the post-surveillance.
The boy was found in the neighborhood of the home, and Dad told me.
Ronaldo again wild - rips the paint difference to Mess
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish League during the weekend and continued his factory in the Master League.
The fight between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo against the Masters League’s goal king turned for at least a moment in favour of the latter.
Real Madrid Ronaldo moved alone to the top of all-time goalmaker statistics when he shot a visitor on the Shahtar Donetsk network two hits on the penalty kicks and one on the gambling situation.
Ronaldo raised his goal balance to 80 when before Tuesday, the Barcelona Messiah, reading with him, had a total of 77 hits.
Real won a 4-0 match.
Juventus has been colliding in the Italian football league in Serie A since the early days, but in the Master League's division D, it started with a strong 2-1 guest victory from Manchester City.
The victory goal was made over ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The attack on the city bore the absence of a kneeling Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the Valioli all week’s game, only came to the field in the last ten minutes.
The second Manchester Society also had a tough experience in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after suffering 1-2 deaths.
Luke Shaw, a 20-year-old ManU, had only a quarter of an hour to fight.
The dangerous-looking slip coat of the PSV Hector Moreno hit the target of the attacked ManU package so badly that Shaw was likely to break his leg.
Shaw lay at Eindhoven’s home stadium for ten minutes before the medical staff left to carry him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests to the 1-0 line on the 41st minute, but the joy of ManU lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno evened before the break in time.
In the second half of the year, Luciano Narsingh was the winner of the PSV.
In the Master League of the Painting season, A-block Paris Saint-Germain began.
It was the Argentinian Angel Di Maria who switched to PSG on Manchester United's shirt.
Di Maria broke through the right and picked up Johan Wiland, Malmo’s goaltender, past the back corner of the ball.
Edinson Cavani made PSG 2-0 for the second half.
PSG's been bets on the successes of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of the league's small euro, is not the best benchmark.
For the first time, the PSG star winner Zlatan Ibrahimovic met with his professional career starter Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmo in 1999.
Roman Ermenko played 90 minutes when his team, Moscow's TsSKA, lost in the B-block game in Germany to Wolfsburg, 0-1.
The opposition party immediately called for a break-up - the president gave the wrong speech
Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, has once again given the same speech he gave at the end of last month in Parliament.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently didn't realize the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether Mugabe, 91 years old, was fully alive.
The MDC of the main opposition called on Mugabe to resign because this is too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants rushed to say that the confusion had only taken place in Mugabe's staff and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mr Mugabe's speech discussed the impact of China on the country's economy earlier and now.
Germany and Austria want an extraordinary summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an extraordinary summit of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council leading the summits, will assess the request.
According to the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to better register for Europe.
The negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are, according to Merkel, part of the Minister of Interior's table.
The professor's admitting in an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend.
The university professor, Shannon Lamb, asked for a voice in an emergency call to shake the police at his house and told him he shot his girlfriend.
Lamb specifically mentioned that their beloved dog was present and alive and probably scared, and the professor told me that the contact information of the dead woman's family would be on her phone.
The police inside the house found the body of Amy Prentiss and the message that was written on the white paper: "I am very sorry and I wish I could cancel what I did. I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," Lamb's letter said to the authorities.
There were no signs in the house that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 500 kilometers to the school campus.
Lynn Buford, Head of Police at Delta State University, said that the university's official was informed of the shooting at 10.18 a.m.
According to him, Lamb called a fatal emergency call for a while after this.
One more death was possible in one day, and the Lamb took his own life when the police reached out to him.
On the next day, students and teaching staff remained visibly behind locked doors, and the authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb’s motive.
The researchers examined the details in both locations, and the Lamb’s students told us about the man. The researchers had a picture of a talented but perhaps problematic teacher.
Students always said they were looking forward to professor hours.
According to the Gautier Police of Prentiss' death scene, the professor had no previous history of violence or crime.
Schmidt, for his part, had mentioned Lamb in his book, which had given recognition to the "happy people" with whom he was allowed to live a academic life.
Both worked at the Institute of Social Sciences and History, which included 17 people in the teaching staff. Many of the students participated in both men’s courses.
However, there were indications of problems.
The student, Brandon Beavers, told me that the professor seemed agitated and nervous, "as if he had a problem."
Another student Mikel Sykes said that Lamb had told him at the end of the academic year 2014-2015 that he was suffering from stress.
She had previously applied to Delta State University for a sick leave because of some kind of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's remuneration policy meant that the claim that Lamb had worked hard for would not automatically guarantee him the post of assistant professor.
William LaForge, Director of the University, told us that he was not aware of the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but noted that something was clearly bothering Lamb.
The Lamb can no longer answer these questions.
After leaving campus, the police found out what route the Lamb had come from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before the police reached Lamb, he had taken his own life with a 38-caliber pistol in the back yard of the house in Mississippi Greenville, about a mile and a half from the home of his parents, methel Johnson, D.C.A., told him.
The Lamb's car was still on the driveway.
The police did not immediately find out why Lamb had gone to this very house, but Johnson told me that he believed he knew the people of the house.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb started his work as a teacher in science and education at the University with 3 500 students. The city had 12,000 inhabitants in 2009 .
He got his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb’s most long - term friends described this as intelligent, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston told me she met Lamb through her friends when she was 15 years old and she was 20 years old.
He was still friends at high school, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who tried to teach Hairston guitar for years.
"That was when the sheep was quite a heartbreaker.
All the girls were on his meds," said Hairston, now 40 years old and now lives in Jackson's suburbs in Brandon.
I guess Lamb and Prentiss had been seeing each other for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb told me he killed his wife, but according to no document, they were not engaged.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, and they lived in a brick house in the river shower in Gautier's small town.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen told me that he broke up with Prentiss 15 years ago.
"He was totally shocked," O'Steen said of his daughter.
"Daughter and mother were best friends."
O'Steen hadn't met the Lamb, but his daughter Abigail told him he liked music and played blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail both appeared at the summer event three years ago.
Later, they also played together.
According to O'Steen, his daughter plays music and plays her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and a part-time entertainment coordinator at a modest restaurant outside Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss on September 5 when Lamb had played guitar and lip harp to a few audiences.
Nothing told me anything was wrong.
"Happy couple," Shaffer said.
"We were joking together.
They both had a good sense of humor."
"Professor Schmidt, who died, directed the first year's seminars and was specialized in the history of the Indians and colonial times," Don Allan Mitchell, professor of England, told.
She was married, and she had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was the chairman of his own brotherhood and the student community.
The campus at Delta State University in Cleveland has 900 people gathered at the memorial ceremony in candlelight, including teaching staff, other staff, students and residents of the region.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a nighttime event where the university choir presented the songs "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The teaching continues on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get the students back," LaForge said.
"The crisis situation is over.
This is a healing day."
Amy and Rogelio Solis are reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Assistant journalists: Associated Press journalists Emily Wagner Cheats in Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana New Orleans.
The case has been corrected because the police are now telling us that the Lamb called after Schmidt was shot, and it was also specified that although the Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife in the emergency call, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us does not intend to hire seasonal workers as much as last year. However, the dealer of toys and baby products tells us that they are offering their current employees and seasonal workers the opportunity to take extra hours.
The company is planning to hire 40,000 people for shops and distribution centres across the country. In 2014, it hired 45 000 seasonal workers.
Most jobs are part-time.
The interviews of applicants will start this month and new employees will start in October-December.
Although there are still months to go, the trading season is approaching a good pace, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers for shops and the delivery and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "date" with Princess Diana.
The first night of the film Return to the Future was an important moment for Michael J. Fox's career.
The first night also had a personal meaning.
"We sat in the theater and waited for the Royals to arrive, and I noticed that there was an empty place next to me, and it became clear to me that Princess Diana was coming next to me," Fox told me about the coming back in Time document in the trailer.
"When the film started, I realized that the situation reminded me of a lot of dating with Princess Wales."
Back in Time is related to the Back to the Future, and besides Fox, there are interviews with Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd and director Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the future film got its first night 30 years ago.
"This film is definitely a time travel film for me," Spielberg said.
Back in Time will be published in VOD and DVD format and will be presented in selected cinemas from October onwards.
UN Secretary-General: No military solution in Syria
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon commented on Russia's enhanced military efforts and stated that there is no military solution to almost five years of conflict and that weapons only bring more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The Secretary-General again urged all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to join forces and support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
At the press conference on Wednesday, Ban told of his intention to meet five permanent member states of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain and France, to discuss the situation in Syria, which would take place later this month in connection with the Ministerial Week of the UN General Assembly.
Mr Ban regretted the fact that the disintegration of the Security Council, the Syrian people and the regional powers has caused a situation that cannot be resolved.
In the context of the Syrian crisis, Ban called for the five permanent Member States to show the same solidarity and unity that reached the Iranian nuclear treaty.
Eight chapters on support polls: is Donald Trump serious?
They've tried to label Trump as an empty-speaker.
He's also been considered a joke.
Some predict a collapse for Trump.
The Republican circles have (to one degree) tried to pull Trump down of the gallup.
Ten of the eleven national gallups show Donald Trump two-digit numbers of support, some seriously wonder what it is about in practice the real estate mogul's chances of running.
However, the elections are only in the early stages.
There has not yet been an announcement that Trump will be elected candidate for the Republicans.
Experts point out that at this time Rick Perry, in the galluppärje in 2011, was allowed to give room to the rising Herman Cain, neither of which finally won the candidate election in any state.
For many reasons, Trump would be difficult in the general election.
External groups, such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth, have taken note of Trump's strong position and have begun digging their pebbles to bring him down.
The following fresh gallup data show that the property mogul cannot be ignored by the ostrichation:
There's been a complete translation of Trump's support.
Just before Trump announced that he would be a candidate in mid-June, only two of the ten Republicans, according to the Gallup at Monmouth University, had a positive picture of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, 40% already had a positive image.
At the beginning of August, the corresponding share was 52 per cent.
Now six out of ten Republicans have a positive image of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten images are negative.
These figures also hold in the states where the elections are held first.
In last week's Quinni Market Gallup, 60% of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two thirds of the Republicans would be pleased with Trump's nomination.
Last week at CNN and ORC gallup 67% of the Republicans expressed their great satisfaction or satisfaction with Trump's possible choice as candidate.
Only two out of ten would be very dissatisfied with Trump's candidacy.
Ben Carson will receive almost as much enthusiasm as Trump (43% would be very satisfied with Carson's nomination and 40% with Trump's candidacy).
Who's next to the most popular candidate?
The third is Marco Rubio, which represents 21 % of the total support.
On the other hand, 47% of the Republicans would be dissatisfied or very dissatisfied if Jeb Bush were elected candidate for the party.
Most Republicans do not consider Trump's temper to be problematic.
Donald Trumpi has been widely criticised for his mightiness and insulting comments. 52% of Republican supporters across the country consider the properties of the property mogul suitable for the President. The views are reflected in the opinion polls of ABC News and Washington Post.
The same reading applies to Iowa, where the first party meeting is held: According to the Quinni Market Gallup, 52% of the Republicans consider Trump's personal characteristics to be appropriate to the Chief of Defence Forces.
However, according to ABC and Posti Gallup 44% believe that Trump is unable to function effectively, and six out of ten consider Trump's temperament inappropriate for the White House.
The Republicans are getting used to the idea.
They're starting to take Trump seriously.
When the Republicans are asked who is most likely to be elected as candidate for the party, CNN and ORC Gallup claim that four out of ten believe in Trump's potential.
The situation has changed since mid-July, when four out of ten would have put their money on behalf of Jeb Bush.
Overall: Republicans have never had a very reliable crystal ball in use before.
At this point in the last election, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry was likely to be a candidate, and only 28 percent of Mitt Romney.
The majority seems to think Trump's campaign is convincing.
Even if Republicans support another candidate, Trump covers almost all the other candidates.
Some experts consider that the divided camp is likely to benefit Trump when Trump’s opponents are divided into different candidates.
The opinion poll at Monmouth University at the beginning of September revealed that, in an imaginary double struggle between Trump and almost any other Republican candidate, Trump would almost always receive a larger support group.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubiota with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points and Rand Paul, John Kasch and Chris Christie with 33 points each.
Ted Cruz and he's even.
Is Cruz Trump the only real opponent?
Ben Carson would take the victory of Trump 19 points apart from the imaginary double struggle.
A small majority of Trump's supporters say that they have already taken a vote.
According to the Gallup published by CBS and NYT on Tuesday, a fair half of Trump's supporters are sure of their vote.
Of course, the situation can change for a number of reasons, and at the moment a certain voter can also change his or her mind.
46% of Trump's supporters have not made a final decision.
Trump's most competitive at this moment is neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who have already elected their candidates are twice more likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans share Trump's view of immigration.
In his campaign speech, Donald Trump called migrants from Mexico two months ago, migration has been a hot topic for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's powerful speeches will banish important Latin American voters from Republican troops and hinder brand renewal.
However, according to the opinion polls published on Monday, ABC News and Washington Post, six out of ten Republicans are on migration issues along the same lines as Trump.
As long as the migration is in the brilliance, so is Donald Trump.
Dissatisfaction with the administration is at its top.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently collecting about half of the Republican votes.
According to the latest opinion of ABC News and Washington Post, this opinion was made by six out of ten Republicans.
These two candidates are also mad at Washington.
According to the opinion poll of Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Iowa, three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with the Republican activities of Congress: 54% are dissatisfied and 21% are on the edge of rage."
Jeremy Corby's debut in Prime Minister's Question Time
Since the elections, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been looking forward to Corbyn's first appearance.
The Labour Party Labour's new image, Jeremy Corbyn, is expected to be up for the first time in David Cameron's Question Time.
Corby's first six questions are being asked shortly after noon, and the media and the Labour Party's representatives are following the man with a hard eye.
Corby's been calling for less theater and adding facts to the weekly show.
He has also stated that he can skip part of the sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
At the meeting, Corbyn's leadership will be considered for the first time in connection with the parliamentary test after the assembly of the shadow government and the annual meeting of the Corbyn Confederation of Trade Unions at Tuc's annual meeting on Tuesday.
The decision by the Labour Party to silence the composition of the national song during the 75th anniversary of the British Air War on Tuesday has received criticism from many representatives of the Tory Party.
The silence of Corbyn during the national song attracted attention.
Corbyn’s representative observed Corbyn’s standing during the national song, silently respecting the heroism of the Royal Air Forces in the Battle of Britain.
However, Mr Smith, a member of the Corbyn shadow government, said in the BBC Two's Newsnight programme that he would have urged the leader of the party to join the national song, despite the opposition to this monarchy.
Ten shadow ministers have refused to join Corbyn's first-rate group, calling for differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs. Less than a sixth of the party initially supported Corbyn's choice of party leadership.
In the view of BBC’s policy correspondent Robin Brant, the political differences about British membership in the EU and the conditions for granting benefits tightened up by the government have been accumulated by the Labour Party since Corbyn.
At the meeting of the Tuc, Corbyn said that Labour was going to propose changes to remove the restrictions altogether.
An hour later, Mr Smith, Minister for Labour and Pensions of the Shadow Government, said that the party's position is very clear: it is only opposed to the government's plans to count the limit from 26 000 to 23 000 pounds.
Corbyn is the fifth Labour Director, whom David Cameron will meet over the past decade under the leadership of the Tory Party.
The new approach to politics, the promised Labour Director, says that he has chosen the questions to Mr Cameron for the 30 000 proposals he has received from the public.
According to Corbyn, elected from the constituencies of the Islington North, Question Time has too many clashes, and he promises to avoid clever wording and licensing and, instead, to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corbyn has stated that the shadow minister Angela Eagle is visiting her during Question Time, for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corby has also given up the idea that others could sometimes vote, and he will tell us that he has discussed this matter with Mr Bercow, President of the Lower House of Parliament.
After Corbyn took up the party leadership in 2005, Cameron stated that he wanted a doll theatre-like policy, often linked to Question Time, but some years later he admitted that he had failed in his efforts.
Since Question Time was first broadcast in 1990, it has been considered as a key measure of the leadership's judgment, control of the lower room and position. However, according to critics, Question Time has become a caricature that needs major reforms.
"Shot in Joburg": from homeless young photographers
Johannesburg center is a challenging environment for a homeless person.
A meaningful way to learn and make money has been found for a group of former street children.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit film studio that teaches homeless young people to photograph their home area and earn at the same time.
BBC News met a young person who had completed the project among the first.

The weight will be strengthened as the UK wages rise.
The weight was strengthened as wages rose in Great Britain, and SABMILLER drew the FTSE 100 to increase.
In May-July, wages and salaries rose by 2.9 per cent in the UK compared to the corresponding period last year. Bonuses were not calculated.
The faster than predicted growth was the fastest since 2009.
The rate was increased by 1% and the rate was quoted at 1.5505, and the rate was also strengthened in relation to the euro, and it was quoted at 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1.49 per cent to 6.229.21 points.
The biggest increase was made by SABMiller, whose rate hurt by 20 % when the company received a preliminary bid from AB InBev, the competing company.
When the trade took place, two of the world’s largest brewery companies would unite and bring under the same roof brands, such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 per cent in the old water of the competing Richemont Group.
Richemont’s latest sales figures are better than forecast, and the development of sales was also rising in Burberry’s key market in China.
Glencore's share rose by 5 percent of the miner's reported intention to raise $2.5 billion in share capital as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The shares in Mondin, the packaging and paper group, were the largest drop by 4.3 per cent when Goldman Sachs dropped the company's share price for sales purposes.
The JD Sports rate rose by 3.1 per cent after the sports company announced that its profit before taxes would increase by 83 per cent to GBP 46.6 million.
JD Sports boss: increased wage expenditure could harm enlargement
According to Peter Cowgill, Chairman of the JD Sports Executive Board, the increase in the minimum wage in the United Kingdom would mean more purchasing power for potential customers.
However, increased purchasing power is not sufficient to cover the higher labour costs incurred by the company.
According to Cowgill, the increase in labour costs may jeopardise JD Sports' enlargement plans and reduce the need for additional labour.
Metcash launches a grass-rooted campaign against Ald's tug
Metcash is trying to secure his IGA shop from Ald's empire in South and West Australia.
Metcash, a wholesaler of food, has launched a grass root campaign to maintain the market share of IGA retail stores in South and West Australia against Ald’s $700 million invasion.
Aldi intends to open two distribution centres and a first up to 120 shops in South and West Australia at the beginning of next year. Metcast and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relationship with local food suppliers and build IGA brands for marketing in mainstream and social media and organise events such as Adelaide show.
IGA stores and suppliers and many brands are involved in the campaign. For example, Simmo, an ice cream factory in Dunsborough, offers tasteful IGA shops, and traders sell tickets to the primary customers for the games of the South Australian football league at a discount price.
Metcashin is expected to publish more detailed information on its defence strategy on 29 September, when the food, alcohol and iron trade close will organise an annual investment strategy date.
It is an important market, since South and West Australia account for almost 30 % of Metcash's footprint of IGA shops, and in these areas the coverage is higher than that of the IGA network in the Eastern States.
South and West Austrian consumers are well known for their cornering, and IGA traders in the region have a significantly higher market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. In South Australia, the market share is 30% and in Western Australia 24%, while in the eastern states only 14%.
For example, Morgan Stanley's analysts believe that Aldi will capture 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of the first stores, which will eat sales from all operators, but in particular from non-chain operators.
This week, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimated that the sale of IGA traders could be made at 360 million dollars and the sale of Metcash at 250 million dollars by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open up 25 stores in South and West Australia next year and will reach the sale of 500 million dollars and 600 million dollars in these areas.
Metcash’s fixed costs are high, so the loss of food sales and volumes can result in a loss of $13 million before interest and taxes,” Kierath says.
At the same time, Metcast loses market share in the eastern states mainly to Ald and Coles, although according to a recent investigation by Roy Morgan, IGA’s customers are the most loyal ones.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018. Its market share would fall from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, Magellan Financial Group's leading portfolio manager Hamish Douglass reported at a meeting in Melbourne that it is very likely that Metcash will disappear entirely within ten years.
Metcash has refused to take a public view of Douglas' comments.
It is understandable that Mr Metcash's board member contacted Douglas last week.
Since 2010, the market share of IGA has fallen from 18 % to 14 % and the results of Metcash’s food business serving 1200 IGA retailers have decreased by 43 % from 2012 levels.
However, the wholesaler takes countermeasures and makes over 150 million Australian dollars a year in order to meet the prices of Coles and Woolworths for hundreds of products per week. Ketju wants to support traders in the renewal of stores so that they can increase the supply of fresh products and improve the food mix of their own brands.
According to Metcash’s CEO, Ian Morrise, price revision and shop reform plans are at a good pace and the company will be able to re-grow its profits in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Australian tennis union president Steve Healy defends Thanasi from Kokkinaki
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves his behavior instead of his criticism.
According to Steve Healy, the chairman of the Australian tennis union, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a collateral victim in a recent piece of Nick Kyrgyos. The chef deserves a special mention instead of criticism.
A younger party named "special K" Kokkinakis was put into a less favourable photo-bully when Kyrgyos provoked his opponent Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal ATP tournament.
Soon thereafter, in a fight between Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison in Cincinnati, the judge had to break up twice with each other. "Wawrinkan should have turned his back on Kyrgyos and my friend," Harrison said.
In the U.S., Kokkinakis was frustrated at the field when powerful cramps ruined his fight, and Healy has faithfully defended the Kokkinakis.
At the moment, the teen star is in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth for the second-rate single-game champion behind Bernard Tomic at Davis Cup's semifinal against Great Britain.
"I strongly believe that Thanasi has been dragged into her dispute," Healy said.
"He broke the bat when he lost the match in the U.S., and he's not the first player to break his bat because of frustration. I know Thanas so well that he's not proud of his actions.
However, he has suffered very well from, for example, the provocation of Harrison in the U.S. authorities, and I think he deserves recognition.
He's got a strong team and a great family around him, and I think he's just been treated a little unfairly.
He is very mature at the age of 19, he works very hard and completes a very team. He has never had any problems with other players, and he is respected among players. He is practicing hard, is in good condition and really stable and mature young man. I think he should be evaluated on the basis of his own merit."
Healy also supported the decision to drop Kyrgyos from the Australian team on Friday’s important round. Healy describes the solution as a joint decision that works for all parties. However, he supports Canberra’s return to a long-term confirmation.
"First, we want to focus fully on the fights instead of on the part of Kyrgyz," Healy said.
As Federer and Murray have pointed out, the young man has to grow up in the light of the public, and he deserves the criticism of his bad mistakes. However, we are trying to support him in order to understand the consequences of his actions. We are also trying to arrange his own peace. I believe that it is best for both the whole team and Nick."
European migration crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
The state of emergency declared Hungary closed its southern border from Serbia's direction on Tuesday and captured illegal immigrants, with the aim of preventing the flow of the migrant.
There was chaos at the border when hundreds of immigrants gathered together in no country, and the Serbian authorities reacted vehemently.
People fleeing violence had to stay in their tents between national inspection posts for an indefinite period of time
The desolation began to rise to the surface.
As the police helicopter flew in the air above the migrants, they said "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some became protests against the eating and drinking strike.
The Serbian Foreign Minister stated that it does not accept the return of migrants to Hungary at the same time as more arrivals from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not increase the damage.
The situation will need to be discussed in Brussels and other countries in the next few days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The death at the border between Hungary and Serbia began one day later when the 28-state grouping failed in its efforts to develop a common migration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed that the responsibility for the flooding of 40,000 asylum seekers in Italy and Greece was shared, with a view to reaching agreement next month or by the end of the year on which 120 000 immigrants, including Hungary, would be admitted to the EU Member States.
On Tuesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened an extraordinary summit next week in order to discuss the migration crisis in the continent.
However, Hungary did not wish to take urgent action in Brussels or in neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation developed so that authorities in two southern regions were able to adopt more effective means, i.e. to close you and speed up judicial processes in the area of asylum.
At the same time, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, Peter Sijjarto, said that Hungary is also planning a barbed wire fence at the Romanian border to prevent the flow of migration flows from that direction, now that the Serbian border is already ready for a fence.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners participated in the tender for the finishing work of barbed wire fences between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear bottlenecks for migrants and a transit point to the European Union, many of which are refugees from Syria and the rest of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban claimed that the majority of the people arriving are people of high standard of living, not war refugees who have the right to seek security, but the view of the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
Under the new law, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, it is a crime to cross or harm a four-metre-long barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border towards Serbia, which also defines longer prisoners for convicted traffickers.
"As a result of the mass migration situation, the government announces the crisis situation", the government informs the journalists in the city of Szeged in the southern part of the country.
"We follow a strict line: illegal crossing is a crime."
In practice, Parliament still needs to accept military action, which is expected next week, and journalists at the Associated Press News Office have seen heavily armed soldiers with their vehicles and their military dogs for several days.
Orban's internal security advisor, Gyorgy Bakondi, told us that the authorities have intercepted 45 border crossings to attempt immediately at the border and 15 further away.
The police are now in charge of helping people who have crossed the border, and they're being accused of crimes based on new laws.
The authorities will immediately repair the fence.
In addition, the Hungarian authorities closed two of the seven border crossing points on the Serbian border on Tuesday.
Chaos took over the main border crossing point near Roske in Hungary, when the Hungarians opened up a small metal container where people packed in.
About 20 could fit in, but thousands were left out.
Another group of immigrants blocked the main street, which connects Serbia and Hungary. People announced that they were in a food and drink strike until they were released to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton’s leadership in relation to Bernie Sanders reduced half by national gallup
The support rate for former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton is still a two-digit race for the national candidate for democratic president, but Senator Bernie Sanders has closed the gap.
Clinton's support now stands at 47% of the votes of the Democrats (down from 58%) when Sanders is the second in favour of 27% (up from 17%).
The Vice-President, Joe Biden, has not yet announced his possible departure in the Presidential Competition, which is 15% in his support among the Democrats.
More than five months before the pre-election, it is too early to tell the majority of the Democrats who they support.
However, Clinton’s supporters are more sure of their choice of candidates.
Since the Gallup by CBS News last month, Clinton has lost the support of several democratic groups, while Sanders' camp has joined new supporters.
Clinton still has a strong leadership among women and moderates, but the leadership has narrowed.
Clinton's support for men has fallen significantly, and he has only a 5% bow in front of Sanders.
Clinton has lost leadership among democracies under the age of 50, and now he's even with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a clear advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton's head start in support shares among the liberals of Sanders was two-digit, but now Sanders has taken five percentage points of its neck to Clinton in this group.
About half of the Democrats will be happy to support Clinton if he is elected candidate for the party.
A fourth would support Clinton with minimal reservations, and 15% would support him only because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support Clinton.
It is no surprise that the current supporters of Clinton would also be particularly enthusiastic if he was elected candidate.
There is more disintegration among those who are currently not in favour of Clinton, and only about one quarter would support him with zeal.
48% of Democrats would support Clinton, while only 35% of Republican voters would be keen to support Donald Trump, the most popular Republican candidate.
When the Clinton voters are asked to freely describe why they support his or her proposal, the most popular argument is the correct experience of Clinton (16%). Secondly, the most popular answer is that it is time to choose the female president (13%) and, thirdly, that Clinton is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton’s supporters also mention his connection with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
There are also common views and opportunities for winning the actual elections.
The Vice-President is still weighing up his potential candidates, and 57% of the Democrats would like him to go to the competition, and the third would prefer to leave him out of the race.
When a second most popular candidate is sought from democratic voters as a candidate for the party, the majority of them choose Biden.
Over half of Clinton's supporters Biden is, after Clinton, the second most popular candidate and significantly more popular Sanders.
If Biden does not go to the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton will increase his head start over Sanders. With Sanders, the head start is 20 percentage points, and it will grow to 30 percentage points if Sanders doesn't go to the race.
55% of the democratic voters consider Clinton to be the candidate with the best chance of winning the actual elections, but the share has fallen from 78% last month.
Biden, number two, is a long way from Clinton, but more and more people believe that Biden's chances of winning the real election.
However, democratic voters attach greater importance to the chances of winning candidates on matters.
The voters do not consider any of the candidates for a democratic candidate or potential candidates to be impossible to accept.
The voters consider candidates for democracy or potential candidates to be appropriate for their characteristics.
Most people think of Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest, reliable and leading types.
Biden is often described as being honest, whereas Clinton is often considered to be the type of leader.
As many as 30% of Democrats do not think Clinton is honest and reliable, while 15 percent of Sanders is unable to say whether Sanders is honest.
Democrat voters believe that the views of Clinton, Sanders and Biden are close to the ideology of voters.
For all characteristics, about a quarter have no opinion on Sanders.
When asked about the use of the private email of Hillary Clinton and its own server as Minister for Foreign Affairs, the majority of the democratic voters say they are satisfied with Clinton's explanation, and that it has not changed the view of these voters about Clinton.
The Americans disagree more widely.
Half of the Americans are dissatisfied with the Clinton report, and only one third of them are satisfied.
The public's views were divided in March, when the conflict had just come out.
The majority of Americans believe that the controversial use of e-mail has not affected their overall image of Clinton. 36% say that the image has changed in a negative direction.
Of this 36 percent, the majority, six out of ten, are Republicans.
Although the voters of their own party consider Clinton to be honest and reliable, there is room for improvement in these characteristics when asked for the views of all voters: Clinton is only said to be honest and reliable by 32%, which is 8 percentage points less than in the last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
Of all voters, 62% do not think Clinton is honest and reliable.
On the other hand, 55% of all voters across the country do not consider Trump to be honest and reliable.
But both Clinton and Trump get good grades in leadership.
Of the six candidates involved in the survey, Biden, Carson and Bush were considered the most reliable.
Most people think Sanders is honest, but just as with Carson, many people don't have Sanders' opinion.
The sample of the questionnaire is 351 voters, with an error margin of 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson will catch Donald Trump's head start at the National Support Survey.
According to the latest support survey by CBS News and the New York Times, Ben Carson has reached Donald Trump.
These two candidates took more than half of the votes in the new poll and left the other candidates far behind.
Trump still has strong support for the Republican voters of the whole country, which has risen from 23% of the survey conducted by CBS last month by Fox News.
However, Carson's support would increase enormously over the same period, from 6% to 23%.
According to the polls, Carson has strong support for all groups of the population, and in a high-school group, he's going to beat Trump.
Other candidates, apart from Carly Fiorina and the governor of Ohio, John Kasich, will stay far away. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support is weakest and has fallen from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, and Senator Marco Rubio to Florida divided third place by 6%.
The error margin in the sample of 376 Republican voters is 6 per cent in the direction or the second. The survey was carried out in September.
According to the latest survey published by CNN and ORC last week, Carson's support is on the rise, supported by 19% of Republicans, while Trump's support is 32%.
The latest survey by ABC News and Washington Post, Trump, was also clearly led by Carson.
At last week's meeting with the men, Trump charged an inexhaustible charge to a retired neurosurgent, but Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said on Saturday when he campaigned in Iowa.
Five members of the department charged with the death of the Baruch College fux
Almost two years ago, after the death of a student in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people are charged with murder.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Division of Baruch College (City University of New York) brutally abused Chun's "Michael" Deng in September 2013. According to the police, the department did not deliver Deng in time to the hospital, which was considered to have contributed to his death.
According to the authorities, the eyes of the victim had been tied, his back had been placed in a box of nearly 15 kilos of sand and had been attacked repeatedly by him in an attempt to reach a target placed on the other side of the icy field.
Deng is reported to have complained about the headache and then lost consciousness.
According to the police, Pi Delta Ps's department didn't call the emergency number when Deng lost consciousness, and they said they were waiting an hour before Deng was taken to the hospital.
At the press conference, Commissioner Chris Wabner said that the members had time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the president of the department.
At this stage, the members began to hide the instruments, putting the benefit of the department above Michael Deng's health," Wagner said.
Deng wasn't revitalized, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng had been hit several times in the head, the upper body and the thigh with a dull object.
"Too many families have been shocked by the ploughing of the department, as at least one student per year has died as a result of the blizzarding since 1970," says Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the family of Deng, in his opinion.
Divisions and their members must be held accountable where the authorities must take an important step.
The grand jury in Monroe County brought five members of the department on trial for the murder of a third degree.
In addition, 32 members of the department are charged with mutilation and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
"We want to be responsible not only for the individuals but also for the organisation that officially or informally accepted the simulation," Wagner said at the press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the department, and the national department resigned from the local department.
Thus the increase in the interest rates of the Central Bank of the United States of America (Fedin) has an impact
The rise in interest rates and the rise in the stock market became fragile, the return on securities is rising and the economy is falling into recession.
We know that.
On the other hand, we do not know how long it will take and how long the effects will last.
Especially in economic terms, we find a reference in history to timing.
The recession has arrived up to 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank often increases interest rates aggressively, not always, but the determining factor is how the economy and financial resources react.
Therefore, the central bank officials have already been very stressed that investors would not pay attention to the start of interest raising, but to the length of time it takes to normalise the situation.
There are, of course, several variables involved.
In the end, however, market operators may note that any increase in interest rates may be exaggerated.
"The first lifting of the central bank after the global financial crisis was undoubtedly often interpreted as a sign of the end of cheap money," Julian Jessop, a capital economics chief global economicist told his customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect a gradual normalisation of interest rates to a rather low level, which is a frightening standing shock for many people.
However, that does not mean that there are no effects.
Examples of how the impact can be seen in different economic areas are based on this historical trend:
As has already been seen on the market for about a month, the increase in interest rates can increase instability for some time.
When interest rises at last, the effect is not so dramatic.
"The trend appears to be the stagnation of interest income on capital after the first increase for 12 to 24 months, which may reflect a delay in monetary policy," the analyst at Deutsche Bank noted in the recent study of the consequences of the increase in interest rates.
A sharp increase of approximately 14 per cent at the time of the increase in interest rates is generally seen in the market over 35 years, with an average increase of 2.6 per cent for the next 250 days, a normalisation of 500 days, and an average interest rate return of 14.4 per cent after six share movements, says Bob Doll, Nuveen Asset Management's chief equity strategy in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutsche, the impact on the shares will generally increase at a slightly later stage of the cycle and interest income will start to decrease.
The recession is a fact in the economy, but the increase in interest rates usually works for it.
In this case, if the central bank encounters conditions that did not exist earlier and which could speed up the downturn.
Particular attention is paid to the fact that GDP is at its lowest ever in terms of the increase in the central bank’s steering interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, the increase in the 118 interest rates since 1950 has only twice the nominal value of less than 4.5 per cent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 shows 3.6 per cent, many did not imagine it to last, and in the third quarter 1.5 per cent, says Atlanta Regional Central Bank.
The increase in interest rates in such a sensitive economic situation may be at risk and may be asked whether this situation is different,” Deutsche said.
The market players have been talking about raising the steering interest all year round, and the views turn to this week's Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
Many strategies and economics believe that, even if the Open Market Committee were to approve the increase at this meeting, futures trade would only show a 25% probability.
"From 1950 onwards, all the lifting cycles in our research have been in a supercycle, where GDP before the downturn is rising very rapidly," the report states.
The recovery has been very slow compared to the worst recession in the reference period.
The cycle is clearly the longest one that the central bank has been waiting for since the last recession. The record had been 35 months, now it is now on its way to the 74th month.
In addition, fixed-income securities have been unstable when the market was already buying interest, and the formula is repeated on the capital side.
"The fundamental difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than on shares when the central bank changes the exchange rate.
In the case of bonds, the return appears to change the direction immediately when the first up/down cycle starts.
At the end of the rising cycle, income will fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's strategicists believe that the weightings will make long and short-term bonds approach each other and balance the curve.
"High-income bonds often do better in such an environment, although we are still careful about profits," said Kathy Jones, the analyst for solid-income securities in Schwab.
Fascinatingly, Jones said that the market has already adapted to the future change in the direction of the central bank.
"In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and inflation forecasts, there are already several signs of a tightening of financial policy," Jones says.
Short-term interest rates are on the rise, the yield curve is on the rise, the credit risk margins are on the increase and volatility is on the market in a situation where the central bank is tightening up policy.
Broadly speaking, companies that operate mainly on the US market benefit because the interest rate is falling and local products are becoming attractive.
The prospects for debt-intensive multinationals are lower, as a stronger dollar will make their products more expensive in global markets and debt higher.
"Historia shows that quality shares are more profitable in the next three months", Goldman Sachs analysts tell their customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet were defeated by the weak-balance-sheet companies after the 1994, 1999 and 2004 interest payments on average by five percentage points.
Companies with a high return on capital and low volatility shares also did better than quality, on average 4 percentage points and 3 percentage points respectively.
"Velka is a big question.
Companies with a significant share of variable interest rates lose the most," Goldman said.
Consumers, outside the stock market, are generally also benefiting from the increase in the dollar.
Savings also benefit from higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly the effects are visible.
Parliamentary Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM
Conservative Andrew Bingham criticises the radio station for being too popular.
According to Bingham, it is difficult to distinguish the channel from its commercial competitor today.
Also claims the BBC Music Awards Award Gaul only for a copy of the Brits Gala.
Parliamentary Damien Collins, on the other hand, blames the Voice channel for impersonality.
According to a significant parliamentary review, BBC Radio 3 will gradually be converted into a copy of the Classic FM channel, which will increase the pressure on the station to prove that each and every other commercial radio station will be offered.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told the BBC manager that the radio channel of the broadcasting company is becoming too popular and that the channel is no longer very different from its commercial competitor.
"I don't want to talk about popularization, but Radio 3 seems to be changing in the direction of the Classic FM channel," Bingham said.
The BBC Music Awards Award Galleries held last December will also receive criticism from Bingham:
"The BBC Music Awards, which was organised for the first time last year, seem to be a copy of the British Prize Awards.
These two are examples of the fact that, instead of new and different, only what is already on the market is being considered," says Bingham.
The BBC Director-General denied the accusations and noted that BBC Radio 3’s offer had significantly more live music and educational content than a commercial competitor.
"From Radio 3, I learned something from classical music that I can't learn from other channels.
The channel’s commitment to live music and music is entirely in its own category.
I also consider it important that Radio 3 is also committed to looking for new music and to ordering new works," the President said.
Earlier this year, Alan Davey, director of BBC Radio 3, said that the station must work harder to keep the public interested because the British feel more classical music.
However, Radio 3 is not the only critical of entering the territory of commercial channels in consultation with the BBC channel, the restricted Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Mr Collins, the Tory Party parliamentary, criticised The Voice's search for capabilities, which BBC purchased from the Dutch producer Talpa Media, which is estimated at £22 million.
"The programme is not much to be discussed, as it is not unique or particularly distinctive."
According to Lord Hall, the program presented by BBC1, the star judges of which were Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced in a typical manner for BBC.
Collins also required the company to look for a hit program in its own stable when it next launches a new series of entertainments.
Collins, however, refused to rule out the continued ordering of The Voice or the use of taxpayers’ money for other entertainment formats.
The slowest growth of online trade in August – perhaps due to black Friday
In the first months of 2015, online commerce increased by 7 per cent.
Net trade sales have been recorded since 2000. In the last month, growth was the slowest ever.
The online shop was strengthened three years ago by mobile shopping.
Experts believe that a black Friday in November can control purchasing desires.
For more than ten years, the conquest of online commerce has desolated many of Britain’s shopping houses.
According to the experts, there are indications that the online trade is on the move and that the new sales figures show only a 7 % increase in the first three months of 2015.
In August, overall sales growth was the slowest throughout the period when the sales of e-commerce have been recorded, i.e. since 2000. Last year, online sales increased by only five per cent.
According to the experts, there are indications that the online trade is on the move and that the new sales figures show only a 7 % increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If we compare last year's growth with the 2000 readings, it is clear that the growth will stabilise over time," the IRG's chief editor, Andy Mulcahy, told Guardian.
According to Mulcahy, online commerce accelerated three years ago when consumers took up mobile shopping.
"This enabled more and more people to buy from the network, and for many people it was possible to buy in different environments, such as the homewarm.
When mobilization is more moderate, growth can stabilise."
Black Friday from America is a phenomenon that is considered to be one of the causes of the slowdown in growth.
According to experts, the last Friday of November may lead consumers to postpone their purchase decision before Black Friday.
Last year, five times the number of online buyers compared to normal, many of the traders’ websites have fallen.
Experts believe that the black Friday, which makes consumers push behind offers, can slow down purchasing desires during the rest of the day.
According to a study published by the British Retail consortium, fair pounds per five pounds were consumed online.
More than a third of certain products, such as television and washing machines, are purchased from online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes from the network instead of shopping collections.
The place is buried in crane accidents, the victims of the Bin Laden family.
The Muslims carried the bodies of 29 victims on the streets when the first funeral was held in Mecca.
According to Saudi Arabia, the construction major company Saudi Binladin Group is partly responsible for the accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were also injured after the crane fell.
The bodies were carried in high air when Muslims gathered together to bury the 29 victims of the crane that fell upon Mecca Suurmoskeija.
A number of white people had gathered on the streets to say good-bye to the victims on their last journey to the cemetery of Al-Moaissem.
The grief story went to a pilgrimage where the fallen building crane had only been penetrated a day earlier through the mosque roof on the Muslims.
The king of Saudi Arabia demands that Bin Laden’s construction family company be held liable for an accident involving 394 people.
The bodies of 29 victims who died in the Mecca Suurmosker accident were transported on the streets.
After the fall of the crane, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, the Great Manchester, was among the dead, who had traveled to Mecca with his first pilgrimage.
Akram had been with his parents at the Great Mosker, who were about to start their annual journey of hair-sacrifice.
The Saudi Arabian authorities have pledged that a Hajj pilgrimage will take place when thousands of people are currently arriving in the city for the pilgrimage.
According to King Salman, the Binlad Group should not have left the crane booms up when the crane was not used.
According to the Arab press release, Binladin Group is a part of the accident.
However, according to the English press release, the Group’s management is prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall in the yard of the Great Mosquito. Thousands of Muslims are heading to their Great Mosquito for the Hajj-Hos.
The Binlad Group has not published a notice on the accident of the crane and the Group representatives have not been reached for the opinion.
The king also accused the group of not complying with the up-to-date safety regulations and cooperated with meteorological experts.
Tens of cranes surround Mecca’s Great Mossier as part of Binlad Group’s huge construction project.
For decades the Bin Laden family has had close contacts with the Saudi Arabian family, and the Bin Ladens are responsible for several important construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a apostate whose family had abandoned in the 1990s.
Just a few days before the pilgrimage of Mecca, which is the duty of every capable Muslim to do at least once in his life, was an uplifting accident in severe rain and severe wind.
According to the authorities, 158 people are still in hospital care.
The authorities ordered a million ryals (approx. EUR 250 000) to be paid to the victims' families and permanently injured.
Other injured persons receive half of the amount of compensation.
According to the B&Q boss, it's a cheap Eastern European workforce.
The British hire the generals of the home more often, says Veronique Laury.
People coming from Eastern Europe who work as professionals have increased their popularity.
More than 200 new sources of Screwfix for workers are opened.
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores around the country.
Text: Rupert Steiner, Director General, Daily Mail
The British are said to transfer the hammering and painting work of the home to those arriving from Eastern Europe.
Vasaring and painting skills seem to be few these days.
Today, the British employ more and more the generals of the home to carry out the house’s nickel work, says the manager of the company behind the B&Q.
Veronique Laury is the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the home's repair supply chain. According to Laury, the phenomenon is driven by professional workers from Eastern Europe who provide services at low prices.
As a result of this phenomenon, Kingfisher intends to open 200 new Screwfix stores for traders, while 60 B&Q shops are closed.
Laury needs more female work force for B&Q stores, because out of eight ten shopping decisions in the shop she makes.
At the moment, most of the staff are men.
According to Laury, we should take into account demographic trends, since more and more women living alone today are also in the home.
"Our sales personnel are still mostly men," Laury says.
"We need to balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80% of our product buy decisions are made by women.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of the five women who are behind companies in the British FTSE 100 index and has also reorganised the company's management group so that male and female managers are equally.
Kingfisher is almost the only one of its kind, as 50% of its staff are women, including the Managing Director and the Financial Director.
"This was a conscious decision, and diversity is an important topic for us," Laury told.
"It hasn't been hard to find good women for the board."
The business profit and sales figures for Kingfisher's half-year period have fallen, although the company worked hard after the closure of the stores.
Kingfisher corresponds to current trends: the company owns the Screwfix and B&Q chains and intends to open 200 new stores.
The three aces government decided to resort to coercive legislation to save the country's economy.
The apparent effects were achieved quite quickly.
The sharp head of the SAK and other employees' centres began to be forced immediately and as a result the country stands on Friday due to the widespread expression of workers.
Quite a bit of people think there's a reason at that point.
Let's ask if it's worth the strike when it's bad.
Even a resistance movement has been established.
More than 50,000 people on the Internet have already reported that they are not going to participate in the demonstration, but are going to work.
In the old days of good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet where to protest, but openly declaring a rich person would have been a political suicide.
Millions of professional organisations are not much affected by the protest of a few tens of thousands, but it gives cause for thought.
The status of the trade union movement is no longer as clear as it was a couple of decades ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed
From the point of view of the interest of Ay business, the government's rough solutions can also be seen as a direct heavenly gift.
After years of looking like things are rolling on their own, the alliances finally get to the point, namely workers' rights to defend, visibly and properly.
In this way, the government may want to encroach on the role of the Ay movement when membership in the trade union is perhaps seen as more necessary than before.
Whatever the organisation's action, it's stupid that Friday's expression of mind would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial output has been falling for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product is still falling and unemployment is rising.
You'd think these things would force everyone's head.
Hard savings for Lappeenranta University: Objective 8.5 million savings, staff reduction by 130
The technical university of Lappeenranta will start with a savings envelope with the aim of reducing costs by a total of EUR 8,5 million.
As part of savings, the University starts negotiations on the whole staff, with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, this means reducing around 130 workers.
In addition, two million other activities will be saved.
The outcome of the YT negotiations is the 2016 budget, which anticipates a deficit of 8.5 million.
It is also affected by government cuts in appropriations.
During this financial year, the University will produce approximately 2.6 million deficits.
Expenditure will increase slightly next year, but funding from the Ministry will fall by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The university's total budget is around 85 million euros, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive cuts in teaching and research and the reduction in company finance on our university is very important, says Principal Anneli Pauli in the University's press release.
Before the summer, the effects of surgery seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in additional funding appears to be in new proportions.
The negotiations with the trustees will be launched next week on Tuesday and will last for six weeks as prescribed by the law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finland's railways
The owner of Onnibus, the British company Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company is also targeting rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in taking part in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of Britain's largest railway companies, Souter says.
Rail transport is expected to be gradually opened up to competition.
The first is close transport in the capital region in 2017-2018.
Long-distance traffic will take place after close-time traffic.
Souter says he's already approached the Ministry of Transport.
In the Ministry of Transport, Yle says that the plans for Onnibus are welcomed.
Other international companies have reported their interest in rail transport, at least Transdev (former Veolia), which also has bus and rail transport in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
The time of the interest rate decision with the US central bank
The whole world will follow the meeting of the US Central Bank Fed on Wednesday and Thursday, which will decide for the first time on a possible increase in interest rates to almost a decade.
A fair half of the economists who thought last week that the central bank would raise interest rates are now guessing that the central bank maintains interest rates in the current 0-0.25%, as shown in the survey conducted by 80 economists from Reuters.
"This is an historic situation, since the central bank has kept the interest rate at zero for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank can raise interest rates from the zero level, thus starting normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Senior Researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The state of the US economy has been relatively good, and recovery has brought billions of dollars to the balance sheet and only a small boost in inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore a global situation that is not equally rose.
It has called on the market to prepare for change, but there are also indications of the opposite.
The decision is due to be published on Thursday at 20 a.m. in Central Europe.
The shooter at Delta State University left an apology.
After his girlfriend was shot in Mississippi on Monday morning – before his colleague was shot later that day – Shannon Lamb wrote a message in which he apologized for the first murder and hopes he could cancel it, the authorities told him on Tuesday.
In the Mississippi Gautier, Delta State University, Lamb called the emergency number about 10 a.m.
Monday and she told me she shot a man.
She asked the police to come home in an emergency call.
"I shot my wife last night," Lamb told me, and he also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house that was no harm to anyone, but he's probably scared.
The police asked for the caller's name, but he didn't tell me.
And the Lamb didn't give us a motive for shooting.
The police arrived at the scene and found Amy Prentiss, 41, a message written by the body and Lamb, saying, "I'm very sorry and I wish I could cancel what I did.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb drove 500 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Professor Ethan Schmidt in history before taking his own life late on Monday when the police reached him.
William LaForge, Director of the University, told us that he was not aware of the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but noted that something was clearly bothering Lamb.
On Monday, it was reported that Lamb apparently believed that Prentiss was romantically also with Schmidt. However, on Tuesday, the authorities announced that there was no information or evidence of the triniod.
Shawn O'Steen, who had been married to Prentiss for seven years, described his ex-wife as a human being.
The couple had been divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen told me he and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who's upset.
A man said her daughter and mother were best friends.
According to Sun Herald, a close friend of Prentiss's, Lindsay Knowles, told me that Prentiss worked online from home.
Knowles said that Prentiss had been dating Lamb for three years, and he also told me about a woman named Lightning.
"He always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
According to the police, Lamb had called relatives on Monday and told them that he was not going to go to prison.
When the police reached Lamb Highway 1, near Greenville that night, Lamb stopped the car, ran off the foot, ran into the woods, and took his own life.
According to a CV on the university website, Lamb received his doctorate in Della State University in spring 2015.

Over the last few years, the actor has been heavy (in the picture on the left with his son Redmond).
In 2001 he fought leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actor has also fought with drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.

Manchester United Luke Shaw paged for months for two fractures
Luke Shaw's right leg broke in the Manchester United Champions League match against PSV Eindhoven.
The defenseman is sorry to stay aside for at least six months, but Louis van Gaal is still hopeful and believes that Shaw will return to the field this season.
20-year-old Shaw was injured in the P.S.V. defense area of Héctor Moreno's bad fight when 15 minutes were running.
Shaw got first aid in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he could be transferred to the hospital.
"Shaw has two fractures in his leg, and he's in hospital," Van Gaal said.
Shaw will be transferred tomorrow or the day after tomorrow for surgery to Manchester.
A young man who joined Manchester United's ranks at the age of 18 has been through a lot, and he's hurt now after some great gaming moves.
In the locker, Shaw was given oxygen.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but when the leg breaks in two places, he'll be sidelined for half a month and he's not playing anymore in the block phase.
I hope he can still play this season.
Moreno seemed to have made it to the point when the situation was not followed by a red card in the form of a penalty.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish a Mexican player.
According to Van Gali, the Italian judge made a mistake.
"You may conclude for yourself, but I thought the situation was worth the penalty and the red card.
It was a two-legged stick."
Shaw said, "Thank you for all your messages, and I can't tell you how crushed I am, and my recovery starts here, and I'm going back stronger than ever."
Add on: Manchester United's Luke Shaw paged in the PSV game
The defender of England has a special reason to recover from the European Championships in France in June.
"There's a very bad injury in this case," said the PSV coach.
"In situations of such injury, all parties are always very sorry.
The purpose of players is never to harm the opponent."
Moreno broke his legs when he played the Netherlands, which was shot by Van Gali, in the ranks of Mexico, only during the 2014 World Championship.
"He is very sorry, because his intention was not to harm the opponent. It is unfortunate to hear that the injury is serious," Cocu said.
"I didn't see the situation.
I only saw the ball going in the other direction, so it looked like he (Moreno) touched the ball, but I didn't see Luke fighting."
"I know how it feels, and I know how difficult this can be," Moreno said to the SBS6 channel.
"It feels really bad, I'm so sorry."
Andrés Guardado of the PSV was also taken to the hospital after a collision with Chris Sming.
David Cameron should know Lorax better than that.
Each parent will soon notice that the child learns his favorite book almost outside.
Except for seeing David Cameron.
When the children’s holiday organization asked Cameron to name his favorite children’s books, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, a Dr. Seuss’ teaching environmental story published in 1971.
In the text published on the SuperCamp website Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. "The story is fun, touching and creative, and it has a strong message. I am happy to read it to my children because there is always a picture or message that we have never seen before."
It sounds good, except that the next point where Cameron is supposed to describe the design of the book is a summary of the 2012 film version, with new characters and details added to complete the brief original text.
"In the city of Tarville, where real trees and plants have been lost, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, who wants to get into the heart of his dream girl Audrey by implementing this greatest dream: to see the right tree," says the text. In 1991, Dr. Seuss, or Theodor Seuss Geisel's version, had no object of love.
If this is not suspicious enough, Cameron's text is partly consistent with the plot summary of the Lorax movie on the Internet Movie Database. It starts with: "In the city of Tarville, where everything is artificial and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, who wants to get into the heart of his dream girl Audrey."
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the book’s plot would be so foreign to him. Ahne Kerskanen destroys trees and makes them the necessary name-gift despite Lorax’s opposition. Lorax is a small and thick, moustache creature that protects forests.
Probably like this, a minor pr-to-do is entrusted to an assistant, apparently to someone who, as a child, has not read Lorax 20 times in a pipe.
The Prime Minister's representative told us that the text is probably from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps did not comment further, but confirmed that the text was the handwriting of Cameron's staff.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being away from the English team, but it's still hard.
Pakistan's encounter in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but after seeing the team selected for the tour in England, it is not expected to repeat the loss of the last 3-0 series of Test series.
I wouldn't shut down the opportunity of a guest victory.
Alastair Cook's side may be more inexperienced than a three-year team, but the team has good players and the team's attitude is strong – they have no bad experiences in 2012, only a youthful positive.
As a ball player, Moeen Ali develops as a twister, and Adil Rashid, although he does not have Test level experience, represents an attack option.
Subject: Adam Lyth dropped from the English Test Team and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth away is obviously hard for me to understand as his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven tests have been against two good attacks in challenging circumstances, and the simple and cruel truth is that the critics are judged according to the results.
For example, Joe Root is not a questionable choice because, as I said before, players are the best voters.
A few 50-point fights would have kept Lyth on the team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets another chance when he hits Yorkshire for more runs.
The English head coach, Trevor Bayliss, also praised his attitude when he did not do as well as he could, which does not surprise me. He is, above all, a team player.
The question of how long the Test-binger gets an opportunity to impress him is difficult.
Lyth was given seven fights — like his predecessor Sam Robson — while Nick Compton received nine.
Only Compton got a chance at both home and guest games.
The only issue of complaint may be that England first used Jonathan Trot in the Caribbean — when Lyth was in perfect condition — but this past opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales is coming to the team, and he's a hitter, and I appreciate it.
He's the unidentified critic we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he scored 236 points against us on the Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but of course this depends on the composition of the United Arab Emirates team.
The idea has been thrown into the air that Moeen will start a shift with Cook, which will give us an extra spinner at the same time as four quick feeders, and I am not against the idea.
I do not see an obstacle to the fact that the top feeder could be hitting here, and this left-handed player has already shown himself to be a great cricket player.
Fashion may not have reached much in its local team in Worcestershire, but he has been team three player, and that is not a big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Test games as the first replacement player to start in 2001.
He did three hundred points right away, and there was no turning back.
Zafar Ansari is on the team as a detour feeder, and based on what I have seen from him, he has proved to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his statistics – an average of 31 points as a hitter and 35 as a pitcher – and this can be a search shot, but not a lot of circulators have shown themselves to be ready, and voters decided to take a young player.
He'll learn a lot during this fight.
Outside the playing team, England seems to have made a couple of intelligent choices for its coaching staff.
The appointment of Sri Lanka's hitter, Mkörk Jayawardene, as advisor to the Test Games may be a breakthrough.
This is one of the most beloved men of the species who bring much experience, because he has played under all kinds of circumstances and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes on a trip to the white ball and brings both energy and mercy.
I think he has always influenced the appropriate international critic, whether he is a player or a coach, and like Mahela, he has the intelligence to exploit.
Sometimes a new sound in the dressing room, even if it says the same thing as before, can be a spray.
Colly's teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, has rested in one day's match, Root has had a similar opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Even though not everyone agrees, trainers and electors do not set the match schedule.
And it should be borne in mind that, like players, their jobs depend on results.
These decisions will never be made without consideration.
Brexit camp can be won if the economy is off track in 2017
David Cameron's renegotiation strategy for Britain to stay in the EU is increasingly in the swamp every day, even without the 'yes' or 'no' Corbyn choice for the head of the working party or TCC, making a lot of fun for Europe on Tuesday.
Other countries also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farags.
The European diplomat recently explained how many crises the EU is collapsing – although not everyone is doing something of their own – some Member States are fed up with the British selfish agenda, which includes dissenting concessions and harmful Treaty changes that they do not really want.
In Brighton, the TCC's annual Congress decided that they would not like to see social security broken down in the EU either.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor will hang out at summits and bilateral negotiations in the capitals of different countries, take a picture of themselves in front of the famous monument, with or without high-ranking people, return home and tell them that they have acquired allies for reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants the open-minded Britain inside the EU tent, says: "Don't leave us alone with France", Berlin, and suggests that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in different capitals have come to the point that we don't care whether we will be left or leave.
Angela Merkel, the German discretionary Federal Chancellor is an ally, but has been in power for ten years and wants to leave office before it gets ruined, as happened to those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France is facing a re-election or the choice of a successor in 2017.
His power is sinking, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalistic right-wing government, while Spain has a left-wing government.
It is difficult to imagine them running away to help selfie Brits who could use their energy better to try to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, and they do not want it because most people have separatist tendencies.
Some of these ministers may be planning to deliberately throw useless comments into the Scottish National Party's style in the UK's 2017 national election campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
The renegotiation was organised and nothing left to the British side of the renegotiation.
Europeans know how the British press is preying and how the EU's sceptical oligarchy is, as is Tony Benn's work in 1975, the result of a referendum of 2:1 in favour of accession to the EU in 1973.
Someone may well remember Boris Johnson, a knife-like Euro-Opportunist, who became known as "our direct EU banana correspondent" in Brussels in the early 90s.
At least Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They include tax evasion, hacking phones, and apparent-time residents who own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but then he realized that when he's in a cage with a rough gorilla, he's gonna have to stretch bananas into a puzzle so that the gorilla doesn't eat you both for lunch and dinner.
Mr Miliband was even more buririd in his opposition to the referendum, and Blair agreed to the EU Constitution, which was then rejected, and when France and the Netherlands rejected the agreement in the referendum in 2005, Blair was able to get away with it.
The press never forgave him.
But nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly killed me in the back of Westminster on Monday, and I told him he didn't have time to waste on me anymore.
It may take some time, but Corbyn needs to develop a consistent strategy for dating with the media, not with me, but Andrew Marrin, who was sitting on a BBC-back on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what we politely call constructive.
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed Europe.
Most people outside Ukipi and Tory are likely to respond to this.
That's what Hilary "Benn, but not Bennite" Benn told me on the radio and television this week when her inside Boy Scout tried not to admit that it was a bad move from Corbyn to name a rough John McDonald shadow government minister.
It reminded me of the '70s, when his old father had trouble being on television without going too far and losing his place in the lower room.
Hilary's difficulties were more interesting.
Mr Benn said that he was opposed to staying in the EU 'in all circumstances' and that McDonald did not say so to his colleagues and subroom members at a private meeting on Monday night.
He wanted Corby to care about any image of the miracle, to remember that he even touched me. The media is important during the 24/7 era, especially in the discipline of social media, where paranoia and fraud are plunging.
Cameron does not need to be given a free passport in relation to the EU, with which he could see Labour's support as self-evident in the referendum, as McDonald has said.
At least that's what Simon Jenkins thinks.
McDonnell and Corbyn's equivalence of membership of the EU fits into an island economy and the past against capitalism, which is no longer just a small group of left-wing dissidents, who have the idea of a similarity being combined, being a key doctrine in doctrinal mischieves.
There has also been an Equivocation with regard to NATO, and Tom Watson is inconceivable in the fact that Corbyn is not campaigning for leaving, and foreign diplomats are forced to try to clarify it to their own countries.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital?
The United States has already been quite disappointed with the poor British military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in the time of the Tory regime, and I received a reminder of it on Monday in connection with the launch of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise the British authorities’ opinions on electric cigarettes
According to the researchers, the claims made by the State-funded institution that the burning of electric cigarettes is 95% less harmful than traditional smoking were made at a meeting of 12 participants with links to the tobacco industry.
Experts criticise the evidence provided by the Public Health England (PHE) report of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and Lancet Medical Journal.
PHE described its report published last month as "reversible and comprehensive review of results".
However, several researchers have questioned the certainty of the data and raised the links of some experts to the tobacco industry.
Last month, Lancet Medical Journal's headline included a "remarkable horse base" on which PHE's main conclusion is based.
In addition, two researchers in the BMJ have considered whether the claims were established on "cold or sand".
The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Professor of European Public Health Martin McKee and Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at Liverpool University Simon Capewell have stated: "The basic assumption of public health is that the policies are based on clear evidence of their effectiveness."
According to McKeen and Capewell, the general public assumes that PHE's argument that "the best estimate at the moment is that electric cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes" should be based on detailed analysis and modelling of the research results.
The claim is based on one 12-person meeting, which was convened to develop a model based on a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), which was designed to harmonise the views of the participants on the risks of nicotine products.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the meeting sponsors included EuroSwiss Health, which, according to sources, was financed by British American Tobacco (BAT), the CEO's former independent research.
In addition, the Executive Director showed support for BAT’s public health activities in the sustainable operation report.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting was granted funding from an electric auxiliaries manufacturer, but the alleged funding from Philip Morris International as a tobacco company was not granted by that participant.
The selection criteria for the panel's composition have not been explained, but there are a number of well-known supporters of e-cigarettes, some of which contribute to the financing of industry.
However, some participants are not aware of their expertise in the field of tobacco prevention.
The meeting was also attended by PHE’s smoke charger.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the Group's study report shows that there is no uncontroversial evidence of the harmful effects of the products on a wide range of products and their compliance with the criteria.
However, links or shortcomings are not mentioned in the PHE report.
According to the PHE report, so far no evidence has been provided that electric cigarettes can promote smoking for children or non-smokers. McKee and Capewell consider the claim premature.
According to PHE's health and well-being director, Professor Kevin Fenton's arguments have been answered in the past.
According to Fenton, electric cigarettes are significantly less harmful than traditional smoking.
Every other person who smokes through life dies because of tobacco addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of electric cigarettes are lower than the risks of traditional tobacco, but the long-term effects need to be examined further.
PHE is obliged to inform the public what evidence shows and what it does not show, especially in situations where the relative risks compared to traditional tobacco are unclear.
In the United Kingdom, there are nearly 80,000 deaths related to smoking per year, and the cost of tobacco to public health is 2 billion pounds per year.
Responsible action requires that we clearly present the current evidence that electric cigarettes are not a risk-free option, but that the disadvantages are a fraction of the harmful effects of traditional tobacco.
BBC should give up EastSenders, says Channel 4 boss.
Luke Johnson, led by Channel 4, said that the BBC should stop sending certain programs, including EastSenders and The Voice. Johnson said that commercial competitors would give their right hand on the series of hitters, such as the soap series Albert Square.
According to Johnson, the licence fee should only be used for programmes that other television stations do not do.
He criticises BBC's presentation of programmes that are likely to reach a smaller audience at the same time as those of competitors' large audiences, and, for example, on the BBC4 channel.
When Tony Hall, Director General of the BBC, announced that the company wanted to increase cooperation with other organisations, Johnson said that he had been trying to get Channel 4 to cooperate with BBC for six years without results.
"I do not agree with the idea that BBC buys formats and sends programs that are clearly part of the software of a competing channel," Johnson told the Communication Committee of the Upper House of Parliament, which explained the future of BBC.
If the BBC wants to keep a broadcasting charge, which I do not think is necessarily a good idea in the medium to long term, it should reduce its supply to at least programmes that are not produced and purchased by others.
The BBC sends The Voice to the best view time because it wants the widest possible support in the future.
If any other channel doesn't worry about the program, it's clearly ridiculous nonsense.
"I do not understand why a regressive tax should finance programmes that could be financed without subsidies," Johnson said.
The Voice is one of these, EastSenders is another, although it is its own production.
A lot of channels would give their right hand out of it.
I don't understand how this serves the service of the broadcasting company.
I don't think this would be a loss to the BBC."
Johnson is a serial entrepreneur who was led by Channel 4 between 2004 and 2010. In his view, BBC has a good number of viewers because the company works for ambitious people and because they believe that it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson's comments on the BBC's most popular series are in the same direction as the former Sky boss Tony Ballin, who suggested at his MacTaggart lecture in 2003, that BBC sell out series like EastSenders.
According to Johnson, the BBC’s Niche programme is shown on the BBC4 channel, where viewers can usually not be measured, but the programs meet their purpose. “The BBC can say, while defending its hypocrisy missions, that it did make a very special broadcast of £4 billion, and that no one was watching.”
"The BBC will present them in times when no one will ever see them."
With regard to the public service charges, Johnson said: "I challenge you to find another system that is as old-fashioned as that, who gets the best benefit.
Everyone, of course, thinks that 150 pounds a year is affordable, but people for whom it is a large sum, especially if BBC is not much looked at."
David Elstein, former Director of Sky and Channel 5 channels, who also expressed his views in committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should exchange its ancient missions with new "information, teaching and entertaining".
According to Elstein, the current offer of the BBC is unlikely to have a teaching programme – 1 % on TV and 0.1 % on radio – and he adds that the BBC should learn from Australian and Canadian broadcasting companies and give its mission a new belief: "information, lighting and entertainment".
On the cooperation issue, Elstein proposes that BBC be able to increase transmissions, for example, from events such as the Proms festival, which was sent only a fraction of the concerts last year. "The BBC should also join allians in commercial channels, so that the entire supply is also available online," he continues.
The brain cells can be controlled by sound waves using sonogenics.
The video shows how the shuttle carpet changes direction when exposed to ultrasound.
Researchers have grown worms whose nervous system has been genetically modified, so that worms can be controlled by ultrasound.
Small axes change direction when they are subjected to ultrasound with a frequency above the hearing area of the human ear.
Sound waves activate movement nerve cells that are genetically modified with a transport membrane that reacts to ultrasound.
Add on: Researchers follow brain activity with light
According to researchers, the effectiveness of the new sonogenetic method (dubbed sonogenics) was demonstrated in the worms.
Salk Instute, a researcher in California, La Jolla, informed Guardian that one day the method could replace deep-brain stimulation (DBS). DBS is an invasive method for treating Parkinson’s symptoms, where the brain is stimulated by electrical impulses.
But Chalasani noticed that worms begin to react when they are placed in a liquid with microscopic small bubbles.
According to Chalasan, the domes amplify ultrasound waves that advance inside worms.
The reinforced ultrasounds affect the TRP4 ion channels, which are part of the worm's cell membranes.
According to the article published in Nature Communications, sound waves make these ion channels open and activate the cells on which they are attached.
In order to control the shuttle worms with an ultrasound, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of the nerves controlling their movement appeared in the TRP4 ion channels.
When conducting ultrasounds on modified worms, the microcubes reinforced the sound waves and went to the worms, when the signal went off in the nerve cell.
The method resembles some optogenetics, which is a revolutionary tool that allows researchers to activate nerve cells using light.
However, according to Chalasan, sonogenics has certain advantages compared to optogenetics.
The light is directed to the brain that is being studied by light fibers. In contrast, low-speed ultrasounds can penetrate the cell easily, so the ultrasound can be channeled to the brain through the skull.
"We believe that gene therapy and viral treatment can temporarily expose human nerve cells to ultrasound signals in a clinical environment in certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
According to the investigator, the method could also be used in muscle cells and in cells producing insulin.
Illegal torture devices — on your doorstep!
The commercials are a disgrace to the British arms trade.
Look at Amnesty International's anti-armoured mass video.
Creepy killer missiles!
Irons breaking ankles!
Drink bombs!
Proliferators that cause insufferable pain but do not leave traces!
The happy voice and drawings clearly reveal that this advertisement of the largest state fairs in the world is a parodia. The video is produced by Amnesty International, and is designed to highlight the British regime's attempt to sell arms to repression governments at the DSEI (Defence Security and Equipment International) fair, which will be held at the ExCel Centre in Docklands, London.
Add on: DSEI Stations: authoritarian administrations arrive in London
There are also posters leaking to bus stops and metro cars, which require another look.
"The important announcement: are you moving on the subway from 15 to 18.9?" The notification reminds you of the London metro announcements in appearance. There is a picture of the tanker on the other side of the metro line.
"In September, a number of arms dealers arrive in Docklands. Customers are asked for help in order to put an end to the weapons fair."
Three hundred posters have been made by artists whose work was displayed at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped distribute posters around London with a six-pound "hackering package" with six-clock keys that claim to be able to access about one third of the advertising posters of bus stops worldwide.
Transport for London does not laugh at poster vandalism.
One of the pollution commercials of the Special Patrol Group.
According to the curator of Cruel Designs and the professor at the University of Essex, Gavin Grindon, artists have begun to question things and want to bring their political work to the public outside the gallery.
Artists have noticed that social influence through art requires that art be brought into the real world, and many move to work with activists in protests.
One of the anti-armouring posters greets public transport users on the subway.
Amnesty video has been viewed through Facebook more than 100 000 times per day. It has been designed without compensation by VCCP, and both the graphic designer and the odds have also done their work without compensation.
The VCCP's artistic director Matt Lever knuckles the absence of a masseuse and empty point in ExCeL's event calendar, and he realized, "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They tried to make a more realistic, vague corporate video, but bright colors and animation attract more attention."
"They have done a wonderful job and helped us to highlight masses where illegal torture is being traded," says Amnesty Tom Davies.
"Now, the government must take action and ensure that the means of torture are not illegally traded at our home door."
However, perhaps the most creative anti of the station fairs are displayed in exCeL itself, where exhibitors take advantage of great circular expressions from their goods.
In his press release, Saab announced an order made by the US Army concerning "portable AT4CS RS."
The product includes a "specialized warhead that penetrates the target effectively".
That doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight golden rules for people living in student housing
I moved to a student apartment 11 years ago. I was an innocent 19-year-old, and I still believed in berets and moral relativism. Only now I remember the violent smiles I provoked, and countless, long complaints from others.
I can sum up the most important lessons in eight simple rules.
The move to the apartment building is the least burdensome experience and worst shocking.
The situation is easy to talk about: you tell everyone where you are, do you like the interim year, and why what you like about Corbyn, and why you don't "really hate or love Marmite, because it's just yeast, hakhaha, I'm in my room".
Take a breath sometimes.
And help others breathe — show interest and ask other questions.
The question will guide the debate and help you find people you like and people you wouldn't even talk to when your eyelashes are in the flames and these people share the extinguishers.
Give the others space.
The private rooms often function as drinks, cinematographs and public accommodation rooms, but the private room is also a place to dress, starting with underwear.
Add on: Don't even think you're joining together with dating and university studies
For the Introverts, the university is a tough place.
The private room should be a place to calm down. However, many residential homes have a social culture that travels from room to room and creates lifelong friendships.
Such a culture can be a nightmare for a person who needs a place to return.
In this environment, it is not possible to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to go away so that I can recharge the energy I used by dating you."
Try to find out if one of your fellow students is exhausted with social interaction. Perhaps you should not knock on the door and send a text instead.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
In my own student apartment, there was this guy who thinks that the door that was not locked meant that he was welcome in.
He saw all kinds of things.
Make friends with bakery.
You start your studies properly when the bakery is in, so if you bake brownies and knock on someone's door, you don't seem like a 50-digit, a little strange case: "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something small.
Homemade treats are a great way to make new friends.
Your students will have to talk to you, and thanks to a delicious surprise, they will be able to have a positive image of you.
This, of course, requires reasonable bakery from you.
If you serve poor cooks with flour, sugar, and fat, others will probably pretend to be asleep when you knock on the door.
Food moaning is also a common violation of student housing facilities.
Of course, taking another chicken is stealing, but can you drop a drop of someone else's milk can?
Always make sure the owner of the milk can.
I'm sure you'll get permission, even if it's the owner of the can.
I understand very well that it is annoying if someone asks you to do something. Still try to deal with the situation as adults as quickly as possible — unlike my own study partner who gave his milk detergent a penalty for milk thieves.
She's in jail now.
Don't make any noise when other people try to sleep or go to sleep.
Not just because it's polite, but because it's also worth remembering that every man digging another hole...
In my apartment, a girl asked the next room resident to adjust the music to a lower level, for it was three in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
The neighbor just increased the volume.
When I finally got quiet in the next room, the girl let the neighbor sleep for two hours, and she went to the exam for three hours, left the music in her room and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future mate had to move into the same dorm?
And wouldn't it be strange if you thought that your fellow students would be your future mate, that you would start dating, break up and have to see him every day and lose the right to meet him with your mutual friends?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants. If the study partner is not the only one right, try to control it.
If you notice in a moment that someone has forgotten their keys to a room whose door is not locked, the limit of the fuck and bullying is more fluffy than you might think.
It's a good joke, but it's the kind of one that's gonna get better in a minute.
Hideing an object can be a valuable and fun lesson, but no one’s room should be confused with toothpaste and sampoolla.
The door to the other room can be locked and dropped on a glass of water that you put in the freezer, but do not attach anyone’s items to the ceiling on the blue tar a couple of times more.
Racist attack on Kite on the residence of foreign students - The house planned as reception center was hurled in Salo
There was a racist attack on Kite in the home of foreign students on Saturday night in North Karelia.
Unlike the police told us before, it is not the accommodation facilities of minors, but the sleeping facilities of foreign students who have already been in Finland, says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher at the Evangelical National University of Kite.
The windows and walls of the accommodation rooms of the National Institute were bled with racist signs, such as the branchers, and a metal object had been thrown through the window of one of the accommodation rooms, says the Eastern Finnish police.
According to Luukkainen, who was responsible for providing social guarantee training to young people at the University of Nations, there were an estimated ten people at the time of the attack.
"There was a weekend and adult people are free to move, so there could be some elsewhere," says Luukinen.
The National Institute has people living in 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time, as well as newly arrived underage asylum seekers.
Everyone in a messed-up building has a status.
Some are studying in adult basic school, some are studying professionally and some are studying in Finland," Luukkainen says.
A status is a so-called continuous residence permit, which can be granted for four years to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
The police of Eastern Finland investigate the attack as an act of harm and a violation of the peace of the home.
According to Luhkkainen, on Monday an information meeting was held for the students, including the necessary interpreters.
There's no panic in here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for the past ten years, and this is the first time that something like this happens," Luukkainen says.
I don't know. I've got a lot of people saying the mess's already been cleaned out of the walls.
They were suspected to have been at least three men and had been on the move on a light passenger car.
I think this is the head of the youth weekend, when this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious," Luukinen says.
There is also a hospital planned for at the reception center in Salo.
The incident happened last week.
This was reported on the MTV website on Tuesday night.
The hospital wall was drawn by a hacker and written in English "You are not welcome".
There's been a criminal report to the police about this.
Amendment 15 September at 4:02 p.m. Repaired incorrect information provided by the police on the age and status of the people living in the building.
The state will put an end to the Y-train to the herd... passengers in their throats, "open idiotic"
The Y train from Helsinki to the Raasepor herd will cease to run in March.
The news was annoyed by the arrivals of the train at the main railway station in Helsinki.
In particular, the downfall hit the Siuntians, said Torbjörn Bengtström, a municipality.
It's just idiotic, because the population is growing all the time and people at work need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be anything but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says on the HSTV interview video he'll be here with a tractor to the capital.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H- and R-trains on the main track are combined into a new R-line.
Purola's position in Lake Head and Nuppulinna in Tuusula are out of use.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on the route to be purchased by the Ministry during the following contract period.
The contract period will change at the turn of the year and there will be endless routes throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement, which will be finalised in autumn, will subsequently be approved by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
The Siuntio Bengtström considers that the State’s train cutter is a short-sighted operation.
We make the same mistakes we have made in the past and we repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then the regret comes on.
The Y train is also used by people other than the Raaseporians and the Siuntians, because it is fast and passes several stations.
The fate of those travelling further beyond the city area was damaged by the train from the Espoon Annina Pöyry.
"It is particularly bad for those who have to redesign their journey," he said when he was in pain on the Y train.
A little relief is promised.
There is probably a new train connection to the beach, which will replace the Y-train in the Helsinki Region (HSL) area, which will take it to Kirkkonum.
This will increase costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for municipalities and taxpayers in the region.
"We are now looking at different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to assess the costs accurately.
According to Rihtniemi, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid for the Y train in about a million years, of course, much more than that.
The R line on the main track misses two positions.
Instead, the number of train shifts in Ainola and Sauna Kallio will double.
A total of 28 small positions and numerous routes will cease across the country.
The Ministry no longer buys rail traffic from Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
Pieksämäki Joensuu route is shortened to Piksämäki-Varkus.
The trains are reduced on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka harbour and Kajani-Oulu.
More than half a million trips per year will be made on the ground that the total volume of transport purchased by the Ministry is about nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring to the state the annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote in the book The Timeliness of Capital: "Marx should be studied"
The crises in the world economy have raised the surface of Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work, published in 1867-1894, Capital, of the former President of GDP, Yrjö Hakanen, in his book The timeliness of Marx's Capital, published today.
"They're taking him more seriously than they've been for a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx's estimates of the development of the capitalist economy, internationalisation and invading all areas of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of capital capital and imaginary capital have proved to be astoundingly visible.
The list of books organized by Hakasen based on the Capital Seminars also contains Professor of Aalto University, the highly respected Economist Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes Marx's current "Yet and Forever".
But the former Managing Director of the Institute for Research and Business is not Marxian, is he?
Not at all.
On the phone, Korkman says that he does not consider Marx as a current economic thinker but rather an interesting socialist.
Today, social sciences are distinguished and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and professor of literature.
"The usual concept is that the theory of the false opinions of dead men is to begin with," Korkman says.
It's true that Marx's predictions went seriously wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and meaning of the industrial revolution, he drew too far - reaching conclusions from the beginning of capitalism, Korkman wonders.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"The most relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now we are discussing again Marx's interests, such as the division of wealth.
"Marx may give inspiration to someone who wants to understand a big picture of the changing world as a result of the technical upheaval", Korkman analyzes.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is not going to help Marx.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should only end.
Still, Mr. Korkman thinks it's worth getting to know Marx.
"Can't read Marx in the '70s," Korkman says.
"The Maoist and Trotskys and the other sects hated capitalism, but more and more of each other".
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political weight of the years ahead.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's thinking world, like other classics," Korkman says.
The United Nations calls for war criminals to be convicted in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes committed in the civil war in Sri Lanka, reports AFP.
The UN report on civil war in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both the Sri Lankan armed forces and the rebels known as Tamils of war crimes.
It is estimated that at least 100 000 people have died in the civil war in Sri Lanka.
There's no precise record of the number of victims.
In particular, during the last months of the long war, the large attack by the armed forces in 2009 should be properly investigated, and the UN report calls for it to be properly investigated.
The Sri Lankan armed forces report accuses torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which were as likely to be victims as men and women.
According to the report, rebels are guilty of coercion of bystanders and children as fighters.
According to the report, both parties have committed murder.
On Wednesday, Sri Lanka replied that it intended to conduct the investigation itself, but did not intend to allow the establishment of the UN Court of Justice because foreign judges.
In the yo test in England, the social media was hit.
On Wednesday a long foreign language, which most of the students had English, was in turn in the autumn.
More than 16,000 test subjects tested their English skills.
In the experiment, it could be written about social media.
Based on our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, an English-language text of 150-250 could have been addressed to the person holding the website’s advisory board.
The headline was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt corresponds to the Finnish Leelian resting chair.
He was asked how parents could look at things from a young point of view.
There were four subjects of the substance, one of which was to be chosen.
"It was the hardest of them", evaluates the third topic of Porvoo's Swedish-language high school in English by Mia Lybeck.
The third issue was merely a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth topic, Lybeck said it was nice.
It had to write a fire speech about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school, we've had practice writing words," Lybeck says, and evaluates the whole experiment as "almost normal".
In English or Swedish, questions were answered about texts, such as the adaptation of the summer camel to climate change and the processing of large data masses.
On Wednesday, some length of Russian (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).
The autumn articles will continue on Friday, when there will be another Finnish or Swedish test.
In the upper secondary schools, the test is organised normally, so the expression of employees is not affected by it.
The student qualification board invites testers to search for suitable connections in time for the trial.
Even more time can be obtained if it can be shown that the delay was not due to self - carelessness.
In Oulu, the store was robbed with a gun.
In Oulu, on Wednesday morning, a store was robbed in the city of Kello.
According to the police, the kidnapper was dressed in dark clothes and a face-covering commando.
He's normal, and he's about 30.
According to the police, a man had threatened his staff with a handgun and received a small sum of money.
They're investigating this case as a serious robbery.
Police are preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of protestors in Helsinki - support teams from elsewhere in Finland
The government's anti-surgery demonstration will block the centre of Helsinki on Friday, predicts the police.
According to preliminary information, even tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, Akava and STK alliances will meet at the railway station at 11 a.m.
The police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
The police at work, on the other hand, are responsible not only for the alarms and other police activities, but also for ensuring that the giant expression is smooth.
The roads leading to the railway station are closed from motor vehicles for about 9.30-14 hours.
Only alarm vehicles are allowed to enter the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic will be cut from the direction of Kaisaniemi to the direction of the west from the direction of Mannerheiminti.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
For the time being, it looks like it's enough.
I'm not taking a position on the police's work-related issues.
According to Kujala, support teams from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki because of the demonstration.
The police won't tell us about the exact patrol.
"There is a certain amount coming, but as a rule, we can do it on our own," Kujala says.
The police are calling for the avoidance of private car traffic in central Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic route goes from Hakaniemi level to the core centre.
Standby traffic is expected from the morning to the early night.
With protestors from other parts of Finland, there are also many ordering buses to Helsinki.
They won't be allowed to go to the Railway Center.
By definition, the buses are quite distant.
The end of the journey then has to walk to the demonstration site," Kujala says.
The expression also stops Helsinki’s public transport.
From the point of view of the police, there's a positive side.
The question of fluidity in public transport, which is normally addressed by these large crowds, is now partly self-sufficient.
The organisers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of government economic policy may come to Helsinki.
The police expect the demonstration to be smooth.
After all, the people are ordinary working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
The Finns are reasonable and peaceful people," Kujala says.
Local demonstrations are also held throughout Finland on Friday.
On Friday, the expression of mind is unusual in many ways - do you remember these strikes and expressions of mind?
The great demonstrations organised by trade unions on Friday are interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is no very good reference point in Finnish political history, says Martti Siisinen, professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It's no wonder the Ay movement protests.
If it didn't, it would raise your hands in front of the government," says Siisinen.
A very right-wing government has taken on the core points of Finnish corporateism - and also on points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's tough grips are missing in contract law.
There are many features here that the Ay movement is really trying to get on its knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement also has a place to look at the mirror.
For example, a mirror is needed because the Ay movement does not have the support of all employees for Friday's demonstrations.
The new one is now the steep division whose expression of mind brings about amongst those whom the Ay movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
The unemployed from all over Finland expressed their views at the Parliamentary House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a reference point for Friday’s demonstration, it could be the giant demonstration of the unemployed, Murrostorstai, in 1993, says Siisinen.
In the middle of the deepest recession, Murrostorstai gathered 20 000 unemployed.
Esko Ahon (Central) government tripped from labour market crisis to crisis.
It was said that the relations between the Finnish government and the employees’ organisations had never been as bad as they were during the Aho bourgeois government.
Now the government and the Ay movement may be even worse than in the days of Murrostorsta.
Besides, Finland's most bourgeois government is now in power, says Siisinen.
The current government coalition is still so interesting that it is so strictly right, despite the speeches of the Finnish basics.
There were certain elements of the old labor movement at the time of the gloom.
Thousands of protestors are expected to be present on Friday.
The expression also stops public transport and possibly closes day-care centres and schools.
Although the expression of mind does not receive the indivisible support of employees, it can become the largest for years.
In Helsinki, around 300 protests have been organised annually in recent years.
They're all over the floor.
Traditionally, the demonstrations of the Finnish Ay movement have been quite peaceful, even though the way in which they have been operating has been tightened up in recent years.
Traditionally, Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is law-abiding.
The protestors seek to avoid damage to or destruction of property, says Sisinen.
But the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of demonstration has changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs, and the police were prepared to get pig shit on them.
In 1998 the strike of firemen lasted three months.
Among other things, pilots and air traffic controllers had visible strikes.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical varnishes of the 1970s
In the 1970s, the most important strikes were the metal strike in 1971 and the power and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metal men participated in the metal men strike.
The strike was suspended by a committee of reconciliation after seven weeks of the strike.
Metal men received a 16-percent raise.
In the spring of 1977, the electric strike lasted 49 days and caused power failure throughout the country.
Migration in 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20 000 people met at the Parliamentary Assembly, many of which have been made unemployed, to show their support for the work.
Firemen strike for three months in 1998
Firemen's strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, unless the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were caught in egg rain in the protest of farmers against the EU in 1994.
"Siberia teaches, the EU stops", was one of the slogans.
For Espa, the farmers put tons of snow on it.
The EU Summit in Helsinki in 1999 also allowed farmers to protest and burn hayballs in front of the meeting place.
The nurses strike in 1983 and 1995
For about a month, the nurses struck in 1995.
The last time they had been in strike in 1983.
Some deaths during the strike were the colour of the 1995 strike.
The factory threatened with strike and mass layoffs of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass deportation eventually accelerated the negotiations to the outcome.
Doctors licked 2001
"Doctors in the strike - from the obligation" was the slogan of strike doctors in 2001.
The strike of municipal health centres and hospital doctors lasted for five months and led to a lively debate on how the strike could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the salaries of doctors.
Students moving in 2013
About 5 000 students marched for study support in Helsinki from Senate to Parliament Hall in 2013.
Central Crime Police will find out the backgrounds of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police.
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police for assistance in finding out the backgrounds of the refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped at Aisterheim near the German border with 42 refugees.
It is not known whether the truck was potentially on its way to Finland.
The ones on the cold truck were all in good shape.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
Investigation and main responsibility are at the scene in Austria, says Inspector Tero Haapala of the Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling by truck in Austria became more fatal.
At that time, it appears that all 71 passengers on board died by suffocation.
According to the General Radio, which first reported cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited company.
Among other things, the company conducts restaurant activities and its CEO is a foreign-based man, about 40 years old.
In Austria, there have been two arrests for human trafficking in Iraq.
Captain beating refugees, a former drug dealer and a brand-new businessman - a story of five smugglers
The subprime king of smugglers, the violent boat driver, the stylish missionary and a cab driver who thinks he's a good guy.
Such people, for example, carry on transporting human beings to the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci at the University of Trento have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and their written book Death Travel Agency will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the hips of trafficking in human beings, put forward proposals for solutions and introduce smugglers from different levels of business.
HS presents five of them.
I'm gonna beat the crap out of them right now.
The islands of Kerönna on the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians are heading there for summer holidays.
On behalf of their location, the islands are also ideally suited for smuggling, as the island of Lampedusa, Italy, is only 120 km away.
For comparisons: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, the captain who burns in the chain, and the father of six children.
The islands are famous for their shrimps, but the fishermen are more profitable in transporting people.
That's what Emir has done hundreds of times on his blue, ten-metre wooden boat.
If the boat's full, it'll fit 40 people.
After one trip, Emir earns about 8 000 euros.
Emir has five assistants looking for clients all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab spring a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until another outbreak of the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the island of Kerkenna in small groups.
Emir will house them in empty houses for as long as he can see.
Food is given in such a way that customers just and just stay alive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer runs out of money, that's their problem.
We're going to go to the water with the lights shut down in the middle of the night.
The first night is driven off the islands, then stopped, expected the day and driven to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and passengers cry and vomit in waves of 20 metres [20 m] high.
At the destination, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir is on his way back.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats his customers and at least claims to beat up the hangers to death.
He tells us in the book that once the police reached out to him, he threw all his passengers over the side and ordered them to swim to the nearest island.
"I needed customers one by one from the neck and threw them over the side," Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers are coming from the south of Sahara.
I hear his countrymen are gonna have to take this out on him.
I'm gonna beat the crap out of them right now.
We need to show them who's in charge right now.
Just a regular cab driver.
Goran's a very common cab driver in Bocovasha, Serbia.
His cab's not very good. The starter engine's pulling out its last one, and it's seen its best days anyway.
The most important thing for Goran’s customers, however, is that the taxi is moving at all, moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovasha is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers from Belgrade to the southwest.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where families are mainly allowed.
In the forests around the centre, without their families, men are staying in tents, lavas and abandoned cars, which everyone has now managed to find or build.
Families living in the forest who have not for any reason or for any other reason submitted an application for asylum to Serbia.
Some also stay in private dwellings, but it's a public secret.
In the forest population, Goran finds most of his clients.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of border crossings and weekly walks in difficult areas, often in mountain areas and in the dark.
At the end of their arrival in the territory of Bogovasha, at the nodule of large human smuggling, people are dying.
The Goran cyclists are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistani, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their thing once, and that's enough," Goran says.
He says the Africans are trying to make a move.
That's what Goran doesn't like.
Stupid fool all the way.
For example, the price will be set at 300 euros, then they will put it down to 200 and eventually offer 150 euros.
Goran insists he's a nice and kind man.
I don't care about the money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran says he's doing a job cheaper than others, and he's going to charge only 50 euros per person for a ride to the Hungarian border.
It is a third hundred kilometers away, most comfortably on the freeway.
I hear colleagues are asking for a three or four-fold price.
Goran earns around EUR 50,000 a year.
It's not a big deal for a smuggler, but in Serbia, it's a pretty nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis do not carry migrants within 12 kilometres of the Hungarian border.
Goran does not care: he knows the roads and the shortcuts and takes his rides a mile from the border.
Then he points his clients in the right direction and shakes them out.
At Work of Consequences
A 35-year-old Congolese is called the Missionary, and it's not just a nickname.
Indeed, he has a Protestant church in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, with many believers fleeing the Congo, and a small center to help Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing the work of mercy.
It's important for the messenger to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and makes sure that the white underwear is squeezing elegantly under the low belt of his jeans.
The messenger is proud of his new Mercedes, his off-road vehicle, and his three motorcycles.
When the missionary does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
At first, the customer calls from one of the five telephone numbers of the Messenger.
He advises that it is worth arriving at the border in the morning, hiding the money, and drifting into the midst of the traffickers crossing the border.
In order to obtain the status of an asylum seeker or refugee, the Ugandan authorities must be told that they come from, for example, the war zones of North Kivu and that they have had to flee from their homes for violence.
Often it is true, but if it is not, the Messenger will arrange a new identity for the customer.
The old I.D. will be destroyed and another will be acquired.
It's helping the Ambassador's contacts with the Ugandan police.
After that, the customer will be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers will go: asylum application, NGOs, and finally the UN Refugee Organisation (UNHCR).
The missionary knows the bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He invoices each portal separately: lodging an application to the Ugandan police costs about €100, handling documents to a humanitarian organisation about €150 and the migration process, for example, to a European country of €4 500-7 000.
Folio and ice blocks
Tom is a beginner, a former drug dealer.
An Irish citizen in his 40s is on the French coast in Calais, where his job is to load people into the trucks on their way to Britain.
He has a Afghan, French taxi driver, and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they're in a human secret transport business in London.
At night, Tom and the cab driver picked up their clients, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near Calais Center.
They're driving the freeway A26 and they're trying to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car on the freeway, Tom and the driver would go directly to prison for illegal immigration.
That's not what Tom wants. He's been sitting here seven years for drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom runs across the freeway with his clients to the resting place where the drivers sleep before continuing across the canal to the British.
Tom picks the right truck to make sure it's on its way to England right now, not to the Netherlands, for example, and cut off the safety liner.
It must be done quietly so that the drivers do not wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wrapped his client in an aluminium foil, similar to the one wrapped in the kitchen around the cooker or oven potato.
It should stop the police's thermal scanner from detecting a hideout.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the place hoping that he doesn't drive any sudden travelers before Britain.
King of smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous human traffickers in the world.
An up-to-date Turkish citizen has been called the master of marketing and an undisputed king of illegal Mediterranean landings, which governs sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and has been constantly developing new smuggling methods.
He also has one competitive advantage vis-à-vis other entrepreneurs: he is only demanding the money.
One of the new methods is a luxury subscribing: Turkish ports are rented out of the port to take American or European families to a few days of tourist cruises.
In reality, ships will be loaded into a full range of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurdishs and Afghans, who will first be transported from Istanbul to a port and from there to Europe for a fee of between EUR 5 000 and 7 000.
Customers are stored in human stocks, for example, in old industrial halls until it is time to leave.
People get caught in mini-buses and drive somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it is delivered, you must board quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden under cover for the entire journey.
The Marine Guard can only monitor the depth of the ship, as no other sign of the crowd is visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers ejaculate and vomit, the better.
Küçük will receive some EUR 53 000 for one luxury ship after the expenses.
He does not handle practical matters himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, lodgings and other smaller factors to do the work for himself.
During the summer season, transports will take place at least hundreds and Küçük will make millions.
He is believed to have bought land through cover companies, a pharmaceutical company, and over a hundred flats he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 with a representative of the Democratic Party of Turkey and an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical sector.
Apparently, since then, he's disappeared.
Corrigendum 16.9.2015 at 15.10: The Death Travel Office book will appear here, not next week.
The American Olympics tells us in their book about his illness and becoming a prostitute
Three times at the Olympics, Suzy Favor Hamilton’s new book, a 1 500 - foot - long racer, has attracted attention in the United States.
In his book Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton tells about ending his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated-letter published some breaks about the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the top of the game and ran for the second best time in the finals.
In the finals, however, he was panicking.
Right at the beginning, he rushed to the top and defended his lead with a manic run.
However, 150 meters before the finish, his strength ran out.
He collapsed into the track, and the other competitors passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot and thought I'd never run again.
However, I forced myself to cross the line, Favor Hamilton tells me in his book.
Later, it became apparent that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before Sydney’s competitions, and he himself felt enormous pressure for success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of making money for having sex with strangers.
He also overspoked his husband to accept his actions.
Favor Hamilton's cab was EUR 450 per hour.
He says he spent the money on luxury life.
One of Favor Hamilton’s explanations about becoming a prostitute was that he missed the kind of adrenaline spikes he had competed with in sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton discovered that he was ill with bipolar disorder.
The double life of the former star runner came out at the end of 2012, when the Smoke Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was the world’s statistical first at 3.57.40, but remained the last of Sydney’s Olympics.
The world champion cheered when the alliance put Norway's skis under control, "Frenchbacks."
The Norwegian ski king Petter Northug has exceeded the limits of suitability for at least one of his colleagues.
The Northug and the Norwegian Skiing Federation have overturned the sports agreement as of last year and last autumn.
Even though Northug has been offered a better deal than other athletes, it has not been enough for a multiple world champion and the Olympic champion.
The Norwegian Ski Association decided to exclude Northug from the world cup of the coming season.
The decision was given thanks to the double world champion, Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was happy that the alliance put the skier under control.
"Thank you for pointing the spine," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one of the active athletes to avoid working for the union's sponsors," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian skiing union and Northug is about money.
The Northug seems to want to be part of the season's country team so he can promote his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent a union that also takes care of future generations and does not give one athlete with the salts.
At the same time, he recalled that the Union has granted Northug both economic and other privileges for many years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that a single athlete has different rules than just because he has the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own release, in which he assured himself that he wanted to be brave in Norwegian colours next season in the World Cup as well as in the World Cup after the World Cup and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six MM medals, two gold medals.
He was a part of the team that won the messenger gold last winter in Falun.
The Tortoise Day is also celebrated in the Nordic Country.
On the day of September 25th, a stopover takes place at various restaurants and shops, which have been awarded the Bread translater shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high level of food expertise and lower the threshold for going to a restaurant, and to raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, it is recalled that not all high-level restaurants are concentrated in the capital region, but the top restaurants inspected and classified by an impartial operator can be found around Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the importance of the event as part of increasing the visibility of the turtle restaurants and the organisation.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is held in the restaurant Fondisi and Kantarellis in Vaasa.
In Kokkola, the Tortoise Day is attended by the Old Town restaurant.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It was therefore decided to make the event one of the most significant international events of the organization, which will take place in the same day in a different world.
Finland will remain the host country of the event.
Kahahaoki-lehti: Reported to the Chancellor of Justice on the establishment of the Kauhava reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a refugee reception centre for the premises of the current Kauhava ex-registery owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the area continues to be permanently located in the critical infrastructure of the crisis period, which is at the disposal of the Defence Forces and its partner, the Finnish Special Networks Oy.
According to the Kahahaoki magazine, the investment of the reception centre in the same building would constitute a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interests in the area and airport of the former Leniency School, the impact of which has also not been clarified in the preparation of the reception centre, is written in the newspaper.
The case states that negotiations have been held over the last two years on the organisation of flight training and the outcome of any foreign operator at the airport.
This has been discussed, among other things, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and Head of State of the Ministry of Defence, Arto Rädy.
The private person points out to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not a matter of principle opposition to the reception centre, but of the fact that the intended location in the former reserve area is wrong.
The City Government of Kahavan dealt with the reception center issue last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The administration means that the immigrants and the people here have the necessary conditions, and the Niinistö commented to journalists in the evening after meeting the presidents of all the parliamentary parties in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, concern about the management of the refugee situation was linked to all the participants.
He values the ability of the government and opposition parties in Finland to discuss the fundamental issues in a confidential manner.
Especially in these days when we face great challenges
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and the activities of Russia and the United States in the region may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, the Baltic Sea region.
Nimbles are hopeful as regards the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia will be able to do so, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and the continuing tension in the Baltic Sea.
According to Niistö, the NATO issue was also addressed in the discussions.
The President did not take a position on the labour market situation.

Media investigator: Sipila takes a high risk
According to Sipila, communication requires a wide range of channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio calls are one of the other channels.
Such a direct speech channel will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä said to journalists in the Parliament.
The Sipila did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister's television and radio calls become.
According to Sipila, talks may not always be conveyed on the Ylen channels.
If other channels report as a channel, then let's see.
Now we're using this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipila, Finland's economic situation is so serious that it requires television and radio to be given to its citizens.
This issue, which we are talking about, is quite complicated and calls for a longer justification.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä figured it out.
The speech will be sent at 21.05-21.20 both on TV1 and radio in Finland.
You can also watch it in Yle Areena.
Sipila takes a high risk
The media scientist hopes that Sipilä's television talk will not tell us about a more general introvertion of the government.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define a public debate more firmly into your own hands and to refuse to discuss the issues of public debate?
I recall Mr Soin's recent comment that he does not respect the media agenda and does not allow it to define itself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these matters are not related.
Koivunen understands that commercial media is inflamed by Sipilä's announcement.
It would be strange if the media didn't react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not democratic issues.
The role of the representatives of the media is to try to ensure that political agendas are not taken into account.
According to Koivuse, TV talk is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, the Sipila should bring something new and specific to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations of the speaker.
Is there more that we've already heard?
Or can he speak in a different tone, in a different way, or in different words, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old thing in the permit, we must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
In that sense, too, if this is not a particular situation, it is a routine speech among others.
The danger is that Yle will be labeled as a message from politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in line with the interest or general policy of Yle.
♪ On the side of a clever bet ♪
In the coming speech of Sipila, what the Prime Minister does not say is also important, the media researcher stresses.
At night we should look closely at where Sipilä is missing and what is not, says Jyväskylä University Research Coordinator Heikki Kuuti.
According to the Six, TV talk is a clever bet from Sipila, because it allows him to bring his own view out without a gravel voice.
This will give a public audience without a journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The Sipila will pass the media and speak directly to the people.
The danger, however, is that the media misunderstands something about speech because more specific questions cannot be asked.
According to the Six, it's very important how Sipila appears on TV, let's see if we can get sweaty, shake hands.
He compares Sipil to the father figure, which now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can do her job well, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government were to inform about something, because in this man, as if he were speaking directly to another person.
This is what Obama and his partners do on a regular basis ( President Barack of the United States).
That's really extraordinary.
Political scientist Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to the public to be truly exceptional.
According to him, this has not happened for decades when the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, Railo says.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister wants to make the Finns sympathetic to the blackmails ahead.
Wage organisations organise demonstrations and strikes against government actions on Friday.
The President of the Left Union, Paavo Arhinmäki, says on Twitter that Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in the Parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, in order to allow the speech to be discussed.
The SDP president, Antti Rinne (sd.), again announces his challenge to Sipilä's dialogue.
We don't have time for monologues.
Soon, six months after the election.
You can't hide forever, Rinne writes on Twitter.
The boy on a 9-year-old runaway has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time.
He's been hit, and in KUNNO, the boy's father upgraded to his Facebook page.
The Homeland Police Department will also confirm the case to the Evening Journal.
He went out for four o'clock this afternoon.
Later tonight, he was never contacted.
Dad thanks everyone who helped me find them.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
This update was distributed nearly 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time.
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed in the violent wildness of young people: You will be hated.
The Kurdita-based free candidate Makwan Amirkhani published a video on Facebook, which appeals in particular to young people from immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani considered the speech against the street fights of young people to be an issue.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and arriving in Finland at the age of five, has so far won both her professional match in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirhani tells me that he received a message asking him to look at one of his Instagram accounts.
Videos have been downloaded in which young people fight with extreme violence.
Amirhani tells me he's disappointed in the wild.
The 26-year-old Amirkan has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
You guys kick on the ground, sit on the other side, and take no notice of any of these consequences when you make these videos, Amirhani updates.
It's hard to defend
Some of the young people in the video have an immigrant background.
According to the Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinosen, both immigrants and young people from Finland have downloaded fighting videos into social media.
It's the fact that you guys are fighting in the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, the Turkish Amirkhani reminds you.
Amirkhani recalls that there are sites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These isolated cases have become quite atrocious.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you now.
You should remember that you're still in a foreign country and you're going to be guests for quite some time.
That's a different way to thank you for being here, Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges the young to remember their loved ones.
If they ever become the target of some kind of racism, then you're going to have to blame yourself for it.
Think about it a couple of times before you guys go along with something like that.
Amirchani says that violent acts are a factor in racism.
You're the kind of hate I don't like.
You have things pretty bad anyway, and that's not gonna make it any better, Amirkhani will decide.
SAK puts its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
The president of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, says on Twitter that the employees' organisation will consider its position on Monday in the alternative savings list presented by the STK.
Lauri Lyly commented on St.T.K.'s proposal on Twitter.
On Wednesday, STTK, the HRC, informed the Government of its proposal to achieve the 5% productivity gap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central).
Mr Fjäder, President-in-Office, believes that the government will accept the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest wage and salary organisation SAK soften its previous position.
In turn, the president of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, made a brief comment on the matter on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will be working on this matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open up the labour market", and that, instead of coercive laws, there is a need for agreements concluded by active parties.
Lyly recalls that Prime Minister Sipilä's proposal for a social agreement was not acceptable to the SAK.
In the past, Sipila cut off the negotiations on a social agreement when SAK refused to commit itself to the 5 % target of productivity.
Comment: The big talk is threatening to pass - "It feels a little funny to put a fist"
It feels a little funny to put a fist in your pocket, if you already have the reconciliation paper in your pocket, Pekka Tiinane will write.
The atmosphere varies from side to side in the employees' camp.
Is it supposed to call the government off or make a deal with it?
On Monday, the Federal Directors of the SAK took up holy hatred for the government of the Republic.
All of Finland was threatened to shut down.
The threat spread even to the Africans.
OAJ, a teacher's trade association, threatened to close schools and day care centres.
On Tuesday, OAJ withdrew: none of the schools or day care centres are completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd) was the chairman of the HRC.
He said that he had contacted the government and that he would draw up the alternative proposal requested by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) as a 5% productivity gap.
Mr Sture Fjäder (cok), President-in-Office, was quick to announce that his paper was already ready.
At first, the SAK's office didn't even belong to the yard.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to agree when the federal leaders just ordered the country to stand up on Friday.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to deal with the situation and that SAK would look for solutions to "open up the labour market lock".
In order to create a joint proposal for employees, the SAK should be inclined to accept a 5% productivity gap as an objective.
No wonder Palola's STK has a good relationship with Sipila's government.
The right hand of the Palace, Jukka Eminus, director of the social impact of the STK, used to be a special assistant to the central prime ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kiviniemi.
The fire was therefore characterised by the fact that the government's knowledge of ay has always improved.
Coincidence or not, but the entrance to Palola took a little bit away from the Finnish skirmishers, whose premiere of the wedding was the ACP Marko Piirainen (sd).
I mean, it's kind of funny to put a fist in if there's some reconciliation paper in the pocket.
Modified at 18:00: Added information on Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
The President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, criticised the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
According to the President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, Mongolia is better than Finland.
In the capital of Mongolia, the session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly in Ulan Bator has started, in which Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the Helsinki July Festival.
At that time, Finland did not allow the arrival of Russian politicians from the European Union's sanctions, such as Naryshkin, to attend a meeting - a matter which the President held to remind journalists of.
We believe that this was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again. Naryshkin stressed the news office according to the Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin's criticism was directed at the United States, where his access had also been prevented.
The words are political suicide by the EU, the Naryshk proclamation.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation was able to overcome the challenge, so Narysh also continued to blush Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for its "excellent organisation".
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with the most positive results - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The leadership of Mongolia understands that parliamentary dialogue should not have obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanervan (cok), who led the meeting at Ulan Bator, who has already spoken with the Russian delegation according to Russian media.
The lock meets the real playoff troll: "Paints in tight"
Killer and Clairvoyant continue in Hakametsa today when both are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti expects no actual goal party tonight in Hakametsa.
The killer went to Kuopio yesterday to pick up a 3-2-long-term victory from KalPa.
The rise was mild, since last season's silver team was worst at the loss of two goals.
The lock on Tuesday was more complex.
The Raumian catch was a guest of Blues, who started with a back-up, with a round zero point, and loss readings as well as 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if any of them play the same game as last year, Locker Janne Lahti anticipates positions on the club's pages.
The killer has become quite a playoff nightmare for the ironics.
In the last two years, the killer has just dropped the lock in the middle of the finals.
A decisive seventh match has been required on both occasions.
In the last season, the lock took the series to a break in the fourth game, but Tappera rose in three of the following breasts and passed.
There are no major changes in the group's configurations except for goaltakers.
Both of the cashiers who fought last night will be on the table today.
With the goal of killing Mika Norone makes room for Tomi Karhus, and between the lock-tips Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Face: A bad play is running at the top
The Sport Director Toivola wrote a copy of an inappropriate extension to Rautakallio, writing from Santtu Silvennoinen Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone wrote a Rocky movie where he played the main part himself.
The answerer sensibly set up a heavyweight series for the world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a lot of sympathy, even though he finally lost the title fight.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Toivola wrote a restless Cinderella story to Pori.
The anonymous and wooden pasta package advanced to surprise everyone with the SM finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous, but tough, underdogs like Rocky.
There was White Indian, Porin Matt and Pele Pelto.
In the falling games, the players colored their heads red and cut the irokes.
The hopeful one became a blonde.
The great TV reporter, JP Jalo, called Coach Neumann.
Aces took the won silver.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
The writer, Toivola, believes that this season’s novel works in the same way as ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports executive for the ace has built a pasta on the back of the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been rotting shit in the remote like Rocky's pig carcases at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäe, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparis are earned in a game other than a puck.
Toivola has forgotten that in Rocky VI, the main part is Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has crossed the Ironallion to Sean Connery.
In Rocky, Toivola’s handwriting work, the main performer was as clumsy as Connery would have been in the original work of 1976.
There's nothing else in the iron rock than Rocky's nickname.
The game philosophy of the Iron Fallion does not include rushing and small-scale fishing.
He appreciates the hard game, but it's different to play hard than a pig.
In the last season, the Aussian Garret Stafford taced the Lamb’s Jere Shepherd’s head.
He got two and ten minutes from the judges, but Rautakallion put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We're the only ones who deserve to play.
I don't accept a game like that, and it's not part of an ass-knife, and the hot iron-knifeed Iron-knife woke up after the game to the Satakunta people.
The team of this season has been strangely built.
There are trains, veterans, policemen and smugglers.
There are no key men of the best age in the game.
It's no wonder the head coach's been complaining about the art project.
How much have you been able to influence a player's acquisition, Pekka Rautakallion?
Last season's events affect procurement and unfortunately the situation on the market was rather narrow, Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
Under the surface of the stove.
The 1953 Ironfallio model is known to be interested in moving to Toivola's place as a sports boss.
Men's contracts will end in the spring.
The ace balance in the three leagues of the season is equal to the loss of goal difference 1-6.
Toivola shouldn't have written the rest of the script.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuki's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband when she was a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
For the first time, Olga Temonen acts under the guidance of her husband.
Yeah, I'm doing a movie with my husband's friend's mom.
It kind of feels crazy, the actor and the producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He has been married to the Austrobothnia ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple has worked a lot together before, but now Olga plays under Tuuka's direction for the first time.
Olga's role in the film You made us beautiful The mother of Sipe Santapuki is a drummer.
Sirkka semppapa and supports his son, even though his father Risto (to present Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I have become acquainted with my true example of Sirka, the easier it seems to be to play the role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me with the part.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but since then the twin has approached a lot.
They've met, they've been on the phone, they've been on the phone.
Sirkka's been very helpful.
We've been through a lot of different angles through their history.
Fortunately, the circus also understands that drama is a drama and the truth may have to be a little coloured.
Olga stresses that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apuland would become Finland's largest band.
It was a recession in the '90s, and it was really bad.
There was a little chance that someone would actually make it, but Sirka had some intuition, and she was right.
Olga tells me that she had heard a lot from Tuukka about this youth even before the movie plans.
However, the parents ’ stories have sometimes been slightly different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how many parents really know what you were doing.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from Tuuka, who was known as Heinola’s notorious skater.
Olga was a regular and kind girl who wouldn't have had anything to do with Tuuka.
At most, he could have been secretly in love.
According to Olga, he's been working so hard with Tuuka for 10 years that a big joint project is not afraid.
Everything's always been great.
Now the whole production group leaves for a month for the shoots in Heinola.
True, the couple living in Iti often plan to drive home overnight because of their small children, because the distance is not too long.
We're taking over Heinola for the whole month.
They have welcomed us very warmly, only to ask which streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 rose to Finland's most expensive play movie
The budget of the Iron Sky: The Come Race film, directed by Timo Vuorensola, is EUR 17 million.
The shoots will begin in October in Belgium.
Timo Vuorensola, director, starts filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
The follow-up to Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, is becoming Finland's most expensive drama film with a budget of EUR 17 million.
In the past, the title of the most expensive Finnish film has been Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation, which is under way, will rise once it is completed past Iron Sky 2, with a budget of over EUR 100 million.
Timo Vuorensola’s film and film by Tero Kaukomaa starts in October at the AED Studios premises near Antwerp and lasts for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium next week.
I'm not afraid of the garbage budget.
I've been so sick! I've been so tired!
I'm so relaxed about the script because I know exactly what it's like to be a movie.
Everyone in the working group seems to realize that something has been done.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, he'll tell the Evening magazine.
The original budget for the film had been planned for 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also grew.
The budget's big, but there's a big story.
But 100 million would be stuck in the film, because every angle and the effects are so expensive.
Now everything's been turned so tight that there's no loose ends.
Today, the film production company Iron Sky Universe launched a mass finance campaign and a bond, with an annual interest rate of 4-8 per cent.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
In no later than two years, the company will repay the loan.
The film includes Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junk or cool?
Big logos return to their shirts
In recent times, large logos have decorated the fronts of trends.
A while ago, a fashionable dresser avoided clear and large logos like Crocs in a console.
The advertising of a hood or a T-shirt was seen as a bit of a dung.
But times change.
Sport has become a megatrend of fashion, and so have old, familiar sports fashion brands such as Adidas and Nike.
And as often as before, the funny and trendy border is fluctuating: if something is right, it will become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. the tavis fashion, where trends surprised us by favouring as boring basic clothes as possible as a means to separate themselves from the mass.
Instead of putting on a gray basic college, the vervain that is buried on the bottom of the cabinet, before which the manufacturer’s logo is in front of it, is being added.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, Adidas is also identified by track blacks, the favorite team’s gaming shirts and the New York Yankees caps have made a return to the street fashion.
Now, Calvin Klein logos are cool detail at the edge of the jeans.
The trend seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands.
For example, the front of the Versace fall buffers makes it clear what brandy clothing is all about.
Would you be ready to introduce the logos when you dress?
The Russian politician published the proof: I was not stuck in the tank’s hatch!
It is claimed that a special incident would have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, where Russian Arms Expo, rapporteur of the Russian military industry, was held.
In recent days, the Russian media has spread colourful claims that the Russian emergency department had to remove large-scale Zoovia from the tank compartment for five hours.
Since then, Zotov has done everything in his power to deny the information.
He even published on his own public Facebook pages a picture in which he seems to be peeking at the door of the armored vehicle in quite a good mood, and not, at least, on the basis of these images, it is nothing to get stuck or angry.
That's total nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go in the battle armored wagon. It was an assault tank BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier myself, Colonel. I've served at Ural.
I went in there, looked around and came out peacefully, and Zotov said to Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I wasn't stuck, and I didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
To the Russian army TV channel, Zotov explained his desire at the exhibition for new Russian technology because he was himself a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what was inside the carriages. I was looking forward to our technology.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And I'm definitely going to visit every tank and every tank in the next show, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the journalist who wrote about it stupid.
One idiot wrote and everyone else repeated it.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside and came out.
I'm tall and ratty, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere, didn't happen, he said Russkaja sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov’s words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged hovering have been published, although a total of 50,000 people attended the arms show in a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck started from the Bloknot.ru site where Zotov was told about his ribs when he tried and threatened to shoot everyone around if he didn't get out of his garage.
Later, the Bloknot site published a follow-up story in which the organisers of the exhibition reported their views on what had happened.
Everyone's just used to soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles.
But Congressman Zotov, because of his size, simply stayed when he came out.
But in no way did he sit there for five hours, said the coordinator of the exhibition to Alexander Pisarevski Bloknot.
Here's the favorite item of decorating bloggers
Architectural brothers Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) The candle of Lassen from 1962 seems to have been designed today.
A cubed steel frame is like an art work, and that's what it was originally about.
Architectural brothers are known for their long and mathematically accurate shape.
It was initially presented only to the lords of a prestigious dinner party.
The Kubus candles are manufactured by the family company By Lassen, who maintains the design heritage of famous brothers.
The candles are produced manually in eight, four and one candle versions in Holstebro, Denmark, in four different colours.

There has been a leak at Agnico Eagle Finland's Kittilä mine, a Canadian-owned mining company.
After the clean process water of the gold mine, the so-called enrichment sand pool has leaked into the stream.
According to the company, the measures to repair the leak have been initiated.
In the pool is the neutralized enrichment sand and purified process water.
Usually, the water is either re-pumped for use as process water or channeled to the environment through a surface water treatment field, as authorised.
The bleeding rate was estimated to be approximately 300 cubic metres per hour when it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of the leak water meets the current permit conditions.
That's all the stuff that went into the environment.
The leak was detected during the check-up tour on Monday morning.
The leak has not been observed to cause structural damage to the tank’s dam structures.
The company reports that it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs around six hundred permanent workers.
Dansken Kuopämäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
The country report published by the IMF today follows largely the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation complained about structural reforms covering Finland in order to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed in the whole contract system and in the area of unemployment security.
According to Danske Bank’s main economist Pasi Kuopämäe, structural reforms are agreed, but there are minor differences.
The IMF estimates that there is a great deal of cooperative message for government activities, but on the other hand there are warnings about what should not be cut too much.
These include, for example, infrastructure investments, Kuopamäki says to the economy.
In the view of the IMF, growth projects should also be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
This year, the IMF forecasts a 0.4% growth rate for Finland, which will rise to 0.9% next year.
Danske expects growth to remain at zero this year in his new business forecast.
The IMF is a little more optimistic about this year.
They may have had the most recent findings.
This morning Statistics Finland reported a slight increase in total output in the summer, Kuopämäki says.
Less attention has been paid to industrial confidence or to other so-called softer measures.
However, the differences are only a few per cent.
A dying Nintendo appointed a new leader
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satuori Iwata who died of cancer in July, started her work on Wednesday, said Nintendo on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo from 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face in the game industry.
Iwata, for example, was responsible for launching a successful Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to track Iwata's footprints, assessed by Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima’s task is to bring Nintendo into mobile games strongly, but it does not eat the company’s bread on the side of traditional gaming consoles.
More and more underage asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service recognised that hundreds of children who have come to the country will disappear annually.
This has been reported, among other things, by SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter on their website, according to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of underage applicants disappear each year.
Juha Kannelmaa, Senior Inspector of the Finnish Immigration Service, explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is the same situation in Finland?
How many applicants disappear "under the country" per year?- In 2013, a total of 156 applications were made for asylum by a single minor.
Nine of them disappeared.
Similar applications were made in 196 in 2014 and 11 of them disappeared.
The reason for this loss may be that it is clear from the examination that the applicant is already registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of age there.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue processing the case in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for handling the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will be found later when they seek asylum from another Member State.
In 2014, there were 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 decisions were taken on the grounds that the applicant was likely to have moved out of Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared in the last 123 years, he says.
Is there an increase?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum by a single minor.
While there are no overall statistics on missing minors this year, the number of applicants for asylum is known and has grown clearly, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons, he stresses.
What happens to those who have received the conversion decision?
Will they also be lost, for example, to the "dark labour market"?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, because the police are responsible for implementing the conversion decisions, and Kannelmaa stresses.
Minister of Home Affairs Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of undocumented migrants.
He's taken action.
At the EU Home Minister's meeting, Orpo spoke on refugee issues on Monday about practical measures to manage the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen is selling Timo T.A.'s studio online - see pictures of the devices
Timo T.A., a pioneer in the media sector who lost its working capacity due to the incident, is now on the market.
Mikkonen’s spouse Nina Mikkonen sells Huuto.net equipment that used to be the most advanced professional tools in his field.
The first time we heard about the online announcement was the web magazine. It's my nightmakasin.
Today, much of the equipment has remained on the feet of technological progress.
In the digital media world, television programs are no longer filmed on Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that there will be people interested.
Of course, the equipment is no longer that up-to-date, but it is also necessary as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitised.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of amateurs - collectors and designers of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen is thinking about IS.
The reason for the sale is that the Mikkos are trying to move away from their present stormylä home.
There's no way we can take all the stuff with us.
I've started to invent and see where the goods are being disposed of.
This is where I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There's no more use for TV and radio.
It is clear from recent strokes that a man who has a long career will no longer return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are being sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen's real life work was already archived in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic threatens to drill worse than it thought: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
Today, the drivers of the metro and trams will decide whether they will expand their efforts in connection with the Friday demonstration.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram traffic only during the demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon, it will be solved if traffic stops all day.
Chief Agent Pekka Hirvonen says that the threat is great in the field.
The night and daytime cuts are arraigning drivers, so the government plans to cut the supplements generate resistance.
Hirvonen wonders, however, that stopping traffic all day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stop by Friday, public transport in the capital region is virtually completely stopped.
According to VR, trains do not travel between six and six o'clock on Friday.
There will be no short-distance or long-distance traffic on Friday.
Trains leaving before six o'clock are driven to designated stations.
According to HSL, most of the buses are left behind.
The ACP members are absent from work on Friday morning from 3 p.m. to Saturday morning at 3 p.m.
It is likely that a small number of buses can be driven, driven by a commanding force, and the HSL informant Pirko Repo is the one who thinks it is.
Repo says HSL can't tell you exactly what bus shifts are on Friday.
Wage and salary organisations organise a big demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Centre between 11 and 13 a.m. on Friday.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place at the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to make progress towards Europe, reports AP.
According to Sky News, refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, escaped under panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water guns against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested in a school in Texas, where the teacher thought the self-made watch was a bomb.
In Texas, Texas, a 14-year-old Ahmed Mohammed has been arrested since the teacher considered the selfish watch he brought to school as a bomb.
Mohammed told Dallas Morning News that he only wanted to introduce his electronics performance.
But one of the teachers thought the watch looked like a bomb.
The police were called in, and the situation finally ended with the boy being taken to a youth detention cell in the cuffs.
At no point has it been found that Mohammed claimed that nothing other than that he had made the watch.
However, it is still possible that the boy will be accused of making a false bomb.
According to Mohammed, the police said the watch looked like a film bomb.
The watch is in the custody of the police, but it was known to be made up of a circuit board and a digital display between which there were wires.
The case happened last Monday, and Mohammed was punished for three days on forced leave from school.
His father is furious about the case and the Islamic Council of the country wonders whether the case is another manifestation of Islam phobia in the United States.
Britannia Koskus - Director Labour refused to sing a national song
The song calls on God to protect the Queen, but Corby is an adversary to the Monarchy.
The criticism put forward by the press, which is going to be higher than the right, has also been accompanied by the representatives of Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has offended the people, thought the Labour People's Representative Kate Green in a radio interview with BBC.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday’s memorial ceremony respected the British Air Force pilots’ battle against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corbyn in its official opinion and stresses his respect for the pilots by taking part in the event.
We all owe enormous gratitude to the heroism of the pilots of the Royal Air Force.
He (Corbyn) spoke with respect during the national song, stressed the opinion.
Corbyn's choice of party leader has divided the ranks of the Labour.
In particular, there are those who fear that he will banish moderate voters with his radical views.
Mr Corby is in favour of unilateral disarmament, the abolition of savings and the increase in public spending.
For the first time today, Mr Corbyn is due to appear as a party leader in Parliament at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Mr Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what should be asked of Prime Minister David Cameron.
During the weekend, Cameron broke Corbyn's election on Twitter as a party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, our financial security and the security of our families, and the Prime Minister's advice in his own account.
The reason for the family death in Minnesota is still unclear, and the family's father was waiting for the case.
The South Lake Minnesota police have been investigating family death in Greenwood in Minnesota for a week.
The family of five was found dead in their home on September 10th, and a few days later, the police confirmed that the shooter was the family's father, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After the first shooting with a shotgun, his wife and three of her children, Brian Short, killed themselves in the garage of the house.
Dead for days
The family was found after worried about the absence of children at school.
On the basis of this report, the police went to the house to visit the house and found the short family dead on various sides of the huge house.
According to Star Tribune, it's possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Millions of houses and a successful company
The investigation into the case of Michael Sitar, chief of police, South Lake Mintonka, is still ongoing.
The motive for blood work is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property for nurses on the social media site AllNurses.com.
In 2014, at StarTribune interview Short reported that there were four million different visitors per week on the site.
I have received 50 offers of the company over the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
The success was seen, among other things, in the fact that in 2011, Short’s family bought a crazy house in Greenwood for $2 million.
The house is advertised in Zillow as a car collector’s dream: there are not only 12 rooms in the house, but also a garage sufficient for eight cars.
Court case pending
According to Star Tribune, the family's father was still waiting for the case.
Achieve Test Prep, offering various precipitating courses, had sued him for the comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, short-term comments had not been removed from the site, and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
According to Star Tribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on Short's business.
Vesku Loiri offered you cake coffees
In addition, the three owners were awarded at the therapeutic event with the Finnish hippos monthly horse-ownership prize.
This is great. Loiris commented in a good mood on his honorary chart.
The festive Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100 000 euros.
The artist legend Loiri was still confused by the success of Fabrice Duo in the grand contest.
I still don't think it's happened.
The success horse coach Korpi says that Loir will have full employment while working with the horse.
Pekka orders and decides where the horse is taken to compete.
And I keep my mouth shut, Loiri laughed.
"The greatest donation ever made by a sportsman"
The Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million (about 6.7 million) to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the hospital press, this is the biggest individual donation ever made by a sportsman to charity in Canada.
In addition, the 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital with other financial resources for the next seven years.
Subban and the Canadiens made an eight-year-old deal worth $72 million a year ago.
Subban’s donation amount is therefore significantly higher than his annual contribution of $9 million.
For the award of his donation, Subban will receive a lobby holding his name from the hospital.
The Canadiens players have provided significant help to local hospitals before.
A year ago, long-term Captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a giant amount of money for another city's grand hospital, which provided the hospital with a PET scanner for cancer studies.
You can order a wife tonight from a Japanese coffee shop, serve only bikinis and an Essu on top of your wife.
The theme cafes are tough in Japan.
The markets already have goat coffee, cane coffee, vampire coffee, fish coffee and now wife coffee.
It strikes the lonely, the depressed, and the hungry.
Metro's on the news.
You can order yourself a wife or husband for the evening from the Tokyo Ore no Yome (Finland wife).
It's a waiter who pretends to be a client's spouse.
Half is selected from the list before coming to the cafe and he prepares and serves food.
The wife is facing only the Essu and the bikinis on her head, while the husband is in tight bikes.
The website offers the wife to apply for all information about length and pressure, always on the type of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: the attacks on vehicle security started to take place
The Automatic Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological developments and innovations in the sector, reports Intel’s release.
It is composed of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of best practice in cybersecurity.
The company will update the report on the basis of ASRB's research results.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consultancy company, estimates that by 2020 some 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75 per cent of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share online data.
We can and must improve the cyber safety of cars," says Chris Young, Director of Intel Security.
With the help of ASRB, Intel can establish best safety practices and support the view that cybersecurity is an important component in the design of every car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in data processing.
Ford Focus RS costs approximately 52 000 euros in Finland!
The Fordin Focus RS model has been expected for years as a rising moon.
Finally, the car begins to appear in Finland.
Ford released RS data now that the car world looks at Frankfurt's car show.
Ford's new four-wheel RS is accelerating by its 2.3-litre, 350-hp engine in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and has a peak speed of 266 kilometers per hour.
The price is also interesting for Finland, it is provisionally reported to be 52 000 euros.
The car is already available, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford does not report.
The favourite sign Kia presented two new news at the Frankfurt Car Exhibition - this is the new Sportage and Optima
The new fourth generation of Sportage is certainly more important than two new ones by Finnish nationals, with Kia going to catch a bigger wing of the ever-growing street-storage market.
The new European design director, Gregory Guillaume, is more circular than before.
The axle and the outer dimensions have come in one cents here and the car is breaking up more efficiently.
The engine range is essentially unchanged, but it has been added to it by 177 horsepower-enhancing 1.6-litre turbo.
More Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported closer to sales.
It will have to wait a little longer, as the new Sportage will arrive for us in the spring of 2016.
Even before the change of year, new Kia Optimat arrived in our country.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a whole new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of higher middle-class buyers with better driving features, lower noise levels and higher-level equipment.
Optimise with 1,7 litres of turbodiesel and 2,0 litres of petrol is obtained from the start.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate when the Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbo engine arrives next to them.
At the same time, the Optima farmer will start selling.
The Chisu returned to the stage in a brave blizzard.
Singer Chisu is involved in the Life for Children concert with other domestic stars.
There's an electric blue pantsuit with an open neck opening.
The outfit is a beautiful show of the siro belt of the singer star.
The whole is crowned with a golden metal belt and a red lipstick.
During a three - year break, a singer who has become a mother has received several pounds of punishment with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to end a year.
The singer published his first single album in August.
Going back to the stage and facing the public after a long break is not really exciting for me.
I've missed everything I've done about music, the singer tells me.
In a few weeks' time, Chisu will release his new album called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired the creation of new songs.
At this point, you're wondering if people are gonna find my new album, Chisu is thinking.
Kim Kardashian's motherhood makes me startling again. Now I see her chest.
A true-tv beautiful Kim Kardashian gives speeches one after another.
She's showing her pregnant stomach and bras freely in sexy clothes, last night at 1:00 in American time, when she and her sister, Kourtney Kardashian, left Kanye West, a husband.
Black maternity dress is transparent to the breasts.
It exposes the skin-colored bras under the dress when the lights are flashed.
Last time, Kardashian was dressed for a matrimonial maternity dress when he visited his friend for a dinner party in New York only a few days ago.
The costume was highlighted by black over-generation boots.
The third special maternity dress is as fresh as last week’s Friday, when the presentation was carried out on pregnancy.
The hard laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, the competition is terrible
The top model of Manon Leloup wanted to make up for the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary on "Speaking Dolls", where Leloup and his colleagues talk about a model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine gathered six hard truth from behind the scenes of Leloup.
Every season starts with nothing.
In the previous period, even if you had posed as top designers in costumes, the new season will begin again in castings.
And every season comes with new, fresh faces that compete with the pastors for work.
The models rarely have a place to call home.
The work is a continuous trip and can go for one year with a hotel room or apartment in which fashion houses house their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be untenablely difficult.
New York and Paris are the desired jobs, but they are the most stressful.
There's not just one sort of weight loss.
Agent New York may be asking for the pounds dropped, but in Paris they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is always a risk game.
In fashion weeks, models and designers are together all the time and act as a support network.
When fashion weeks are over, it's a bad difference.
The models want this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but the fact that everyone thinks it's a job to introduce clothes.
They want to be their own people, too.
The work makes the models feel that they are actors who have some role to play.
But you can also express yourself in the work of the model.
You modeled yesterday at Tory Burch's show.
In New York, fashion weeks are currently being celebrated, where planners will reveal their collections next year.
Roope Salminen, who changed his style, plays the most unknown Assistant musician in the film
Roope Salminen performs Antti Lautala, the founder of the band, in a film based on the early years of the Abilanta Association.
Lautala was founded in Apulanda in 1991 with Toni Wirtasen, but resigned from the band in 1994.
It's a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm a rap artist from 26 years old, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I haven't wanted to meet the real Ant before the shoots, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
The talent is clearly unknown to people from that group, so I think it's perfectly good that I only learn his play style from the video.
I don't want to imitate a human being.
A man who shoots Roope Salminen and the Dogs don't go into the role.
The punk manners come naturally, according to the man.
In the punk part of the starry, starry and star programme, many people must have seen the first taste, as well as if they've ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything small, but we always go full-time.
The main actors of Tuukka Temose, who played the bass between 1993 and 2004, were published today.
A group of young actors who have become known to the audience are still quite unknown to the general public.
Rumbal Sipe Santapukki is performed by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtasta Tatu Bluesalo bassist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a tip about her future plague yesterday night when she mysteriously told Snapchat that she was preparing for the most important day of her career.
Roope has already published yesterday in Instagram a picture of his new character, which he has had to do for the film.
Roope, previously seen in mustaches and jaws, has shaved his face into silos and dyed his brown hair into black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
Many parents have had to wonder in recent days how to tell the child about the situation of refugees seeking Europe.
Or is it worth telling you at all?
There is no need to speak out forcefully, a member of the SPR crisis group, counseled by psychologist Ferdinand Garoff.
It is worth protecting younger children, for example, not letting them watch the news alone.
Little children are not always able to understand what they saw, and it can stay in mind and distress, he says.
However, if a child has encountered or heard from refugees on television news images, it is worth mentioning.
It is good to have a discussion about the child’s starting point and listen carefully to what he asks.
The fear of a child may be surprising.
They are not necessarily the ones the parent thinks he is afraid of.
A child should not be intimidated for nothing, even if he is harassed and frightened.
The younger child closely follows the conduct of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child too will feel safe.
Larger children are likely to encounter a discussion about refugees in school, with friends or online.
It is good for parents to speak with them if you think about the child.
The fact is, not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents and their children can reflect on our family’s view of this.
However, do we think that the world is, after all, a safe or secure place?
Parents may also have different aspects of education - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as much as possible.
On the other hand, if family talk about difficult things, the child will have a model of how to deal with the challenges facing life.
This could be useful for him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your children to help the weaker"
The end of your powers?
You can still be a good parent to your child
It's hard to control a blood attack on Pallosalamaa.
Perttu Pohjola got sanded into the abyss of Apila Pallosalama in the middle of the summer.
It only worked on the profits and the number two lines until, at the end of July, there was a collapse in the raves of Tampere.
Since the slave was completely clogged, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered a period of protection from the veterinarian.
The explanation for the exit was found in the sight.
The horse had an infection of the throat.
The disease was not the slightest in the head, but required two courses of medication to break it down.
Since Apila Pallosalama had to exercise lightly, Pohjola says she was positively surprised by the horse’s last run.
It was in Turku on record time after the second SE-Tarama Taruntule.
Apilan Pallosalama was in great pressure from a break when it could normally only be driven for a few weeks.
In view of those things, the slight tendency at the end was understandable, says Pohjola.
The coach assumes that a fair race made the slave sharp.
The horse’s vigor certainly moved on from it, and I hope that it would have evened up.
Apila Pallosalama has been so-called humorous horses.
After not enjoying it, it could have been thrown fat without sickness.
On a good day, however, the slave has been torn off by a lightning sign that the opponents have been amazed.
At high speed, rivals cannot cope with Pallosalamaa, from which even warm-blooded rides can be removed.
Pohjola's hopes include a fine run in Vermo.
However, there is a difference in how Apilan Pallosalama agrees.
It's kind of hard at the time of departure, and it might stick under the boom of the starter car and that kind of thing.
I hope the slave is more calm than Turu's leaving.
As Apila Pallosalama is in good condition, she can also come from the front, and we're going to drive it out of the win, Coach.
That's why you can't get rid of all the useless iPhone programs.
Apple's CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the software that comes with Apple's iPhone phones may sometimes be removed in the future - but not all of them.
Apple will possibly remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, says the CEO of the company Tim Cook Buzzfeed in an interview.
Apple's iPhone contains a number of programs that are relatively rare to use: for example, FaceTime calls, Journalism, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which came as a forced upgrade to iPhone phones, although it is necessary only for Apple's smart watch owners.
Cook says that the removal of Apple's programs is more complicated than it looks.
Some applications are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which iPhone Apple applications work closely with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
So, according to Cook, Apple is investigating this, because the company doesn't want to waste memory space on users' iPhone phones.
Euro area inflation fell to 0.1 per cent in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly in August, i.e. 0.1% year-on-year, while Eurostat reported today by the EU Statistical Authority.
The rise in prices was driven downwards by the decline in energy prices.
Thus, from a few weeks ago, Eurostat revised the 0.2% forecast slightly downwards.
In July the rate of inflation was 0.2 per cent.
In August, the so-called bottom inflation fell to 0.9 per cent from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's forecast for base inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2 per cent cheaper last month than one year ago.
In the EU-wide, the average inflation rate was zero in August.
In July, the rise was 0.1 per cent.
Consumer prices rose most in the euro area, i.e. by 1.4 per cent in Malta in August.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest as prices fell by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent negative according to the EU Harmonised Index.
Euro area inflation remains a long way from the European Central Bank's (ECB) objective, which is a two-percent increase in prices in the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year, the rise will rise to 1.1 per cent, the central bank forecast in its new inflation forecasts announced at the beginning of September.
The United States of America's next attempt is to tighten up monetary policy
The US’s next recession will begin at its fastest in less than a year, but more definitely within three years of Fed’s entering again for a long time to raise interest rates.
And in the financial markets, the recession begins before the next recession.
Fed has pointed out that he might have started the interest payments already this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession can hit it as fast as possible by next autumn and as a course of financial markets before then.
Or at least this happens if the world's largest economy and financial markets operate as they used to be, and if they react to the tightening of Fed's money as they've done before.
Such conclusions have come to the conclusion of the German bank Deutsche Bank’s London market research strategies for Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in its extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed over 60 pages of the Long-Term Asset Return Study to its international clients last week.
The strategies drawn up by the study and the report do not believe that they know when exactly Fed will start raising interest rates or what will happen in the economy and in the market.
Instead, they use the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics to show how the economy and the market have behaved in the past at and after Fed's interest payments.
In addition to historical findings, they will examine which key variables in the economic and financial markets are now on the same or different model as at the time of previous interest payments - and what might be the result.
It goes without saying that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more bitter state to withstand the rise in interest rates than they were before in the 1950s.
The beginning of the recession may not be a year.
The leaders who decided on Fed's monetary policy and its current impetus have, along the course of last summer and the early autumn, suggested that the time has begun to mature to raise interest rates.
The first raise for more than nine years can take place this week.
This will be resolved during Wednesday and Thursday when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Board of the Fed will meet to decide on it at its two-day meeting.
The last time Fed raised his so-called Fed funds steering interest in June 2006.
At that time, the relatively regular, but at a time small, interest-rate series of 0.25 percentage points, which led Fed to raise its interest rates from 1.25% to 5.25%, ended for just two years.
The financial market symptom began in 2007 with the difficulties of the most risky housing financing in the United States, and one year later, the financial crisis broke the world's day of judgment into a nightmare.
The great recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, serious difficulties in the financial markets and the real economy began at a slower pace than previous Fed interest payments have typically taken place.
Similarly, the trials were more severe and bad than ever since the recession in the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategies have screened the rises and declines in the world's largest economies, as well as the turn of financial markets since 1950 and, in some places, since the beginning of the 19th century.
From the 1950s onwards, they're going to report on Fed's interest payments and their financial and financial impact.
The fastest time to start the recession has been less than one year, mostly less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The increase in the exchange rate on the financial markets has been completed within two years of the start of Fed's interest payments.
Fed has in turn raised and in turn lowered its steering rate since the beginning of the 1950s for a dozen different cycles.
Each time there are some differences between the two, and a relatively limited number of times in the review, it is unlikely that there will be any conclusions on the impact of subsequent interest payments.
The strategies therefore remind us that this time many things are different.
And not just better.
The interest rates are too low for too long
While the underlying causes of the financial crisis may not necessarily be found out without question, even through decades of research.
But for the three reasons that led the crisis and its destructive power, I think it is somewhat undisputed that:
1) Fed, the ECB of the euro area and other major central banks in the world in the 21st century considered their governance interest rates too low for too long.
They were locating traces of the technogram, and they also raised the next one.
2) Over the decades, the accumulated volume of debt in the various parts of the financial and real economy, and in the past, increased even more as a result of the central bank's overexploitation of monetary policy.
The largest debt bubble in economic history so far was born.
3) In particular, the craziest debt financing packaged in the financial economy, which has been the most fragile, increased the largest currency bubbles in the economic history of most sectors of the financial markets since then, from shares to real estate, debt books and commodities.
It is unlikely that it is very severe to argue that the higher-up financial markets were in a rarely dangerous and unstable situation when Fed and the other central banks last driven up interest rates.
The fiscal structures imposed on debt banks did not last until after interest payments had started and the cost of debt financing had risen.
The risks came about as a financial crisis and were followed by a major recession.
Bigger bubble and more debt
Deutsche's strategies do not guess what will happen next, but they give the subject of nuance, for example, by mentioning the following:
1) Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy going even further than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even further lower.
2) Debt has not been madly cheap for a long time as it was ten years ago, but now it is literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the debt burden on the financial and real economy has not been reduced, but now, in various parts of the economy, debt is much more severe than before or before the financial crisis.
3) Liquidity, which has been issued at a lower and lower rate than ever, has largely remained in the financial market and has slowed down key types of securities and assets to the highest cost since then or at any time prior to the financial crisis.
And not only are the strategies latinised by the warning signs of the financial markets, but they also point out that even the US economy has not recovered from the financial crisis and from the most severe recession in decades to the model that has taken place in the past.
The euro area economy has barely recovered.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state but, accordingly, the pressures and risks on financial markets are incomparably higher than before the financial crisis, when Fed next starts to tighten up his money supply.
Perhaps the picture of the future of Albert Edwards, the French bank Societe Generale, is not as strange as it may suddenly be.
He has long trained the bank's international investor clients in the following full translations of Fed:
First Fed raise interest rates, then the financial bubbles break out, and soon it'll be time for Fed to turn off the financial pieces with even bigger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) which manufactures computers and printers will reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are targeted at HP's business service provider, the company reports.
In November, HP is divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., which focuses on printing machines and printers for consumers.
HP’s workforce was highest in 2011 when it had 350000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302000.
The company will record one-off costs of USD 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise reduces 20,000-30,000 employees.
The reduction of the consumer side will remain at 3300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its activities to low cost countries with 60% of its employees in low cost countries in 2018.
The company reports that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers are responsible for more than 10% of its operating result.
In the second year, its three most important customers accounted for 65 per cent of the operating result.

Yle: Minister Berner has been acting in the Board of Tax havens
According to Ylen, Minister of Transport and Communications, Anne Berner (Central) has been a member of the Board of Directors of the Tax haven Company.
According to Ylen, the company was involved in so-called tax planning.
It is a Luxembourg company called Saltri II LuxCo, which was appointed as a member of the Board of Directors in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Board of Directors.
Berner himself says he filed a notice of resignation in May of this year.
I checked it out, and it's enough that I've filed a divorce notice.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place on an agreed schedule, says Berner at the interview.
Membership after merger
The Luxembourg company manages the ownership of the Swedish company Kährs.
Kährs is a park manufacturer who fused with the Finnish park manufacturer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner worked for the Karelia-Upoflor Government in 2010-2013 and after the merger with the Kährs Government and the Luxembourg company.
According to the above, the ownership of Kährs in Luxembourg is through a multi-ported ownership structure.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted a government membership at the Luxemburg company at the request of the second largest owner of Kährs.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been a part of the Karelia-Uppoflor government owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was contacted for a partner that was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to ensure that the capital benefits of a Finnish family company were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the income of our Finnish companies' capital is taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's ownership in the company does not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up on the tax haven is due to the fact that Triton, the largest owner of Kährs, had already had a capital fund ready for ownership by Luxembourg holding company.
Espoo opens a reception centre operated by the company
The first reception centre operated by the company will be opened in Otaniemi, Espoo, for adults.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants from 6 p.m. today.
The number of seats can increase to a maximum of 300-400 people within a week.
The Finnish Immigration Service will set up a reception centre in the property of the former Rescue Institute.
The operation is maintained by Luona Oy, which is specifically responsible for the provision of healthcare and medical services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy agree, among other things, on the security arrangements of the Centre.
STC is preparing an alternative work-life tightening package
The St.T.C.C. is preparing an alternative package for the government's tightening up of working life.
The organisation also wishes to see other employees' centres organisations.
According to President Palola, attention is currently being paid to Friday's demonstration.
Alternative means of reducing the price of work are then restored.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola pointed out that the organization’s administrative meeting would take a break from the reporters.
On the other hand, Palola believes that the Central Business Union (EC) is not ready for discussions.
The economyists of the STSK have calculated that the change security contained in the Government's competitiveness package costs the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, while the other half of the package is EUR 2 700 million.
I don't know if it's a big deal of enthusiasm to have a conversation if it's on the side of one relationship to a hundred.
Palola: The negotiating relationship was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is due to submit a communication on its own package to Parliament and start preparing for the reforms.
Palola did not take a position on whether the timetable was realistic.
According to Palola, the connection to the government exists and it has always been constructive.
According to Palola, the staff centre association for the STK field is a painful place, especially for the Sunday supplements.
The organisation requires that the government withdraws from coercive legislation to implement part of the blackmail.
According to Palola, the STK does not allow the alternative package to be prepared with the SDP.
Employees meet on Friday in Helsinki to oppose the government's work-life blackmail package presented last week.
As part of the package, the salary for the first days of sickness is cut, the overtime is reduced to half, the Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and the holidays are reduced to 75%.
The STC stresses that central organisations have invited employees to participate in demonstrations and that the aim has not been to arrange a strike.
Akavan Fjäder says thank you.
The President-in-Office, Mr Fjäder, thanked the St.T.K.K.K.K.K.K. for the announcement of the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, the STK is now on the same lines with Akava, as there is an alternative model for government presentations in Akava.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, because without SAK the package is not sufficiently comprehensive.
Mr Fjäder, President-in-Office, hopes that the SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will come along to prepare the proposal as an alternative to surgery.
Mr Palolan STK said earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, the plan announced that it had long prepared its own proposal to negotiate the 5% competitiveness leap sought by the government of the country as an alternative to the cuts.
The plan has been ready to negotiate all along, and we have long written an alternative model for government presentations.
We are ready to look at the terms of the employment relationship as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to the Akava lines, as STTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together on a model that goes to the government and employers of the country, says Fjäder.
The Bureau will meet on Thursday at 15 a.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same boat, the same coal, the same balls" - play bingo while Sipilä speaks tonight
University of Tampere Green Left
Viva bingo coupon for the Green Left of the University of Tampere for the evening.
In the past, the Prime Ministers have made exceptional statements during Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä will exceptionally speak to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on the Ylen channel on Wednesday night at 21.05.
In order to apply for the previous Prime Minister's speech, it is necessary to go to 1932 when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister when he gave the famous radio speech, which marked the beginning of Mäntsälä's rebellion.
After that, the President and the ministers held several radio speeches during the winter and post-war period.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen closed the strike of train drivers on television.
Loneliness, Monarchist Meininks
Sipila's speech has raised criticisms and conjectures all day about what to expect.
On Twitter Paavo Arhinmäki, President of the Left Union, said that "Silä could give her speech on the state of the nation in the Parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, allowing her to discuss the speech".
According to the Green Ville Niinistö, "one call has already been seen.
Leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
The SDP Erkki Judgments on Facebook condemned "monarchist ours: the Prime Minister will tell the people what is best for it".
The President of the SDP, Antti Rinne, challenged Sipila's dialogue: "It's been six months since the elections.
Not a single performance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
We've tried.
What are you afraid of? @juhasipila?
Public service
According to the Prime Minister's Office, Sipila's speech has been recorded in advance and takes about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, it is commented directly on by SAK President Lauri Lyly and EC Managing Director Jyri Häkämies.
High has been criticised for making Sipila's speech.
We considered the issue and said that it was part of the public service mission to promote the entire Finnish public, and the director of the Yle publications in Ismo Silvo Yle's news.
It's like we're at Tammels' time.
The speech has also raised ridicules.
In the evening, dinner is enjoyed in good time, children are combed and dressed as their best.
My mom puts on a nicest hole, and my dad matches the tie to his neck.
At nine o'clock, you'll be quieted down to the TV, like you used to do at the time of the Me Tammeloja," says bloggeri Saku Timonen.
"In his speech, Prime Minister Sipilä also tells us why millions of millionaires who hide their capital in tax havens are sitting in the Finnish government, who are drafting pardon laws for their fellow tax collectors, and at the same time claim to the people that it is necessary to cut when the government has run out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
As Sipilä says, one guess is presented by the University of Tampere Green Left Viva.
It's been published on Facebook by the bingo below.
Are we hearing about the same boat tonight, the same coal, living in debt, and the team spirit?
Coupons and pens ready, at 21.05 it begins and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: Western countries rejected Russia's proposal to set aside al-Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected Russia's offer by which the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would have given up power, reports President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian UN Ambassador proposed a plan whereby al-Assad would have left power elegantly after some time.
However, the Western countries did not accept the proposal because they believed that Al-Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent member states of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurk listed to him in a two-sided debate a three-point plan: the opposition was not allowed to be armed, the opposition had to be reached immediately between the opposition and al-Assad, and the abandonment of Al-Assad had to be carried out with restraint.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree with all things, but we are able to discuss them openly.
I told him what I was doing there, and he said sit down, Alas, Martti, and I'll tell him what we need to do, and Ahtisaari will remember Guardian at the interview.
Diplomatics don't comment
The Ahtisaari reports that he passed Tshurkin's message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion, but Ahtisaari says there are no two words about it.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's arguments, but said that Al-Assad's troops had already committed several massacres at that time, and the main opposition groups refused all the agreements by which he would have remained in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs's Middle East Department, takes the Ahtisaari's speeches into distrust because, according to his experience, Russia was at no point prepared to discuss the fate of Al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported Al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest part of Ahtisaari's argument is that Tshurkin spoke with the Moscow Council.
If he had told me about Tshurkin's speech, I would have said that I wanted to hear the same thing from President Putin so I could take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would have suspected that it would have been Putin's fight to hold power with one of Al-Assad's supporters.
The refugee current for our own actions
During the negotiations in Ahtisaari, some 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
According to the UN estimates, the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the current year.
Over 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is what we do.
I see no alternative but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill we ourselves caused, says Ahtisaari.
Centre for asylum seekers with a sturdy tortoise
The Government’s Centre for Asylum Applicants in Northern Finland is likely to be established in Tornio.
The Centre would be set up in a building in the centre of the city of the empty Tornio Cooperative.
The Ministry of Interior has sought a suitable place to better control the refugee flow from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat announced on Tuesday that the Board of Governors would have already decided to present the school building as an option for the Ministry.
According to the Vice-President of the City Council of Tornio, Sauli Höppinen (left), that is not true.
When the entire council was not assembled and some of the people wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite the council meeting to decide on the matter next Monday, he will specify the STT.
There were 36 delegates out of 43 at the meeting.
The organisation centre was opposed by 13 delegates.
On that basis, you could expect the decision to be positive," says Eöppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday, and the city responded quickly.
An estimated 500 asylum seekers would be available at a time.
The expert has been checking that it is suitable for such use.
The location is two hundred meters from the border, so it would work in that sense too, says Nousiainen.
Sipila still hopes for an alternative to blackmail in the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä, halving the public holiday money would only cover part of the government's aim of calculating the price of work.
However, the government is happy to accept an alternative package if the social partners are able to agree on such an agreement.
Sipilä told the journalists in the Parliament that she had not been in contact with the social partners.
He also did not know how seriously organisations were looking for compensatory measures for the tightening of working life announced by the government.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's view, half of the allowances would be a means of dealing with almost all the employees, unlike, for example, the operation of Sunday supplements envisaged by the government.
The social partners could agree among themselves on the cut-off of holidays because they have been registered in collective agreements instead of the law.
On Wednesday next week, the government will tell the Parliament about the tightening of working life as a communication from the Government.
According to Sipila, the proposals made by the organisations should be known before this.
This is not the end of the line either.
The legislative work will then begin, i.e. the train is on the move and will be more and more difficult.
It's a good time.
It won't take long for things like this, if there's a will, Sipila would.
The list published by the government last week includes, among other things, the conversion of sloppy and helatorist into unpaid leisure days without shortening annual working hours.
In addition, the first days of sickness are reduced, the over-work benefits are reduced to half, the Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and the holidays are reduced.
Reforms will be implemented as a coercive legislation over trade unions, which has raised strong criticism.
As a result of the activities, the Mem­ber Centres organise a major demonstration on Friday, and several trade unions have declared political strikes.
The Council of the Tohmajärvi approved the extension of the Jubilee's warehouse
The council of Tohmajärvi unanimously approved the extension of the hall of Nordic Koivu Oy, or juice hall warehouse, which is a bit of a nuisance.
The criticism was that the project was bigger and more expensive than the one originally mentioned.
Also, a busy schedule with heart.
It was also little wonder that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this stage, the extension of the stock by 400-450 sqm was approved for the investment programme, but will be decided on the basis of the Interim Report.
While there was still a debate on investment of between EUR 150,000 and EUR 200 000 on the agenda, at the meeting, the technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
Investment was supported on the basis of the fact that it brings jobs and tax revenues to the local authorities.
The municipality does not have a risk, as the company pays for the investment as a rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) justified.
There's also a place for Karelian language in Joensuu
The city government eased its previous steep position to bring street signposts in the Karola language to the city center of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and the right idea is to preserve the cattle tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare to be the capital city of the language of the herd because there are no historical criteria for it, and the language of the herd is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of the eastern Savon dialects.
Even after the new decision, there will be no street name sign in the city center.
However, the City of Joensuu is also ready to use the cattle’s language on a case-by-case basis, for example, in the information boards and in the marketing of tourism.
The same attitude is recommended by the city to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a single-language municipality, it is also worth taking a generous view of the use of the cattle’s language now that multiculturalism lives and changes strongly in North Karelia as well.
Karelian language is still a special feature of the county, as is the image of Joensuu as the whole forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can well be used to benefit from the multi-disciplinary marketing of the province.
The derailment of trains will cut the vitality of the province
Train connections are being hit by the region's vitality with a strong hand.
Transport links have a direct impact on the economy and competitiveness of the region.
And that does affect whether or not we can live and work here, the Mayor of Joensuu Kari Karjalainen wonders.
He also highlights air transport, which has also been followed up on several occasions in the report.
It is important for the whole of the region that we do not have the potential to be able to cope with by means of state measures, as is now happening.
We should look at the impact of these transport connections on employment, for example, and Karjalainen stresses.
The worsening of access leads to further challenges for the University of Eastern Finland regarding attractiveness.
Of course, the better services here are, such as traffic connections and housing situation, the easier it is to get students and employees, Jükka Mönkkönen, Principal of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor traffic links also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travels a great deal because of the research.
Marko Junkkarinen, Recruitment Manager, says that marketing the university to Western Finland is already difficult because traffic links are weak across borders.
At present, about half of students at the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Finland.
Some 10-20 per cent of them are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by direct train connection.
The river mouth became one of the sound of the Siu
The opinion of the City Government of Joensuu on the national Siu Sote project is apparently unanimous, but one among the reefs is also amongst them.
At the government's Monday meeting, Pentti Kessalo (sd., in the picture) presented the whole project to be abandoned, but his presentation was ineligible.
The Government approved the City Director Kari Karjalainen's draft resolution, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will give a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train from Kotta to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger train traffic from Kott to Kouvola will continue in the future, although one pair of trains less frequently.
Changes will be made to passenger trains between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One train shift is missed, but still five times a day is available from the Eagle to Kouvola and vice versa.
The reductions are due to state savings measures.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications’ purchase money for the next four years will fall to EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes are completely terminated.
VR will prepare new timetables by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed to the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys snuck off the property.
The rescue facility let a 12-year - old climber on the roof from the climber, who did not get off the roof by himself.
The situation took place in Tornion Hill on Keto Road at 6 p.m. on Tuesday night.
There is an old two - story wooden house with no ladders to the roof.
It did not prevent a group of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mass of the radio amateurs next to it.
The other boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, others were sneaking away and passing by alarming the rescue station to help the last person on the roof safely returned to the ground.
FedEx's turnover varies, weaker outlook for the financial year 2016
FedEx published its weak results in the last quarter, leaving the transport sector weakened its performance forecast throughout the year due to the decline in demand for freight services and the increased cost of land transport.
The company's planning to hire 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
This time last year FedEx announced that he would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
The company's share fell by about 2.5 per cent 45 minutes before the opening of actual trade on Wednesday.
FedEx's forecast is between $10.40 and $10.90 for the financial year ending in May.
According to the fact Set's investigation, analysts predicted $10.84.
The forecast has deteriorated in spite of an average price increase of 4.9 per cent, which will enter into force on 4 January. The additional charges for land transport of heavy or large consignments will enter into force in November.
The company is still waiting for profit growth from the previous year due to cost cuts, increased turnover and growth in e-commerce.
The chairman and CEO, Fred Smith, stated that the company has achieved a well-awaited economic situation that has particularly affected production and global trade.
The plans for the recruitment of seasonal workers were announced on the day after the competitor UPS announced that its plans would employ approximately the same number of seasonal workers as last year, i.e. between 90 000 and 95,000 people.
In the quarter ending on 31 August, FedEx’s operating profit was $692 million, which means an increase of 6%.
The result per share was $2.42, so the 12 analysts of Zacks Investment Research's 12 dollars forecast was left.
Net sales rose by five per cent to $12.3 billion.
According to six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, turnover was expected to be 12.23 billion.
In recent years FedEx has been experiencing a reduction in the international first-class transmissions, which is why the company's Express unit has been failing.
The strong growth in online commerce has confirmed FedEx Ground's performance.
In the last quarter, the net sales of land transport grew by 29 per cent, but the operating profit showed an increased cost of large-scale deliveries and insurance.
The Express Unit produced better thanks to the higher basic charges, while the return on the freight business decreased due to higher labour costs.
About an hour before the opening of the real trade, FedEx’s share price had fallen to $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $1.15.
On Tuesday, the share ended up falling by 11 per cent from the annual average and by 17 per cent from the highest quoted rate recorded on 11 June.
This week, the decision -makers of the US Central Bank Fed will meet for the most anticipated meeting of years, and a group will sit by an eight - foot - long - diameter Brazilian wooden table to decide whether it is time to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
On the wall of the central bank’s decorative two-storey conference room, there is a wall painting in the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen and his colleagues, must put the State's financial interests above all others' interests.
The central bank has a double order from Congress: maximize the employment rate in the United States and keep the prices stable here.
However, since the recession, the central bank’s management has noted the third unwritten mandate: economic stability.
On Thursday, the Central Bank is due to announce whether the US economy is prepared to begin the unforeseeable discharge of the unforeseeable stimuli offered by the short interest rates that remained close to zero at the end of 2008.
Although the majority of the data show that the economy is growing steadily, the recent financial market recession can already get the prudent central bank officials to scare off the increase in volatility by increasing the federal tax reference rate by at least one percentage point.
"The labour market and inflation are, of course, the first and most important in their practical monitoring", says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economic operator of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if the central bank is looking for an excuse not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty in the global market will give sufficient cause to wait again", Piegza continues.
Those who have considered the matter do not agree with what the central bank intends to do, which in itself causes nervousness.
In a study conducted by Bloomberg about half of the economists, interest rates increased this week.
However, the financial markets are expected to have a central bank and the key indicator indicates that only 30% of the potential to increase will be available.
If the central bank increases its interest rate, the exchange rates may be reduced unless the decision-makers soften the impact by promising another raise.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average index increased by 228.89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 1659.85.
"At the background of the blinking process were expectations that the central bank would keep the key interest rate stable this week," said Moody's Capital Markets Research Group's chief economist John Lonski.
"It would be a surprise if the central bank raised interest rates at this stage," he said.
"If this were to happen, the central bank should carefully consider how to keep the hands of those operating on the financial markets without shaking."
The second expert noted that raising interest rates would help to calm the financial markets and remove uncertainty as to when the central bank operates.
Only a month ago, the central bank seemed to be tilting to raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, a first small step towards tightening the financial conditions and thereby strengthening the recovery of the United States.
Even though the liberals believe that economic progress is needed, Yelle has said throughout the spring and early summer that she was waiting for interest to be raised this year.
Although job creation slowed down in August, growth in the labour market has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, which is now at its lowest in seven years and close to the level that the central bank calculates as full employment.
Earnings seem to pick up.
Although inflation continued to fall below the central bank’s 2 % annual targets, the central bank’s decision-makers noted that a major reason for this is the temporary impact of oil prices.
"The economy can and does need higher interest rates, as long as it takes account of the tight labour market situation," said Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics' main economist.
However , the global financial markets did not startle last month when China was dwindling its currency .
Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped up to 16 percentage points of its May record height and investors feared that China's economic downturn would also affect global growth.
The market has accelerated this month, and Dow Jones has now fallen by almost 10% from the peak readings in May.
The upheaval of the market means that the central bank's decision-makers are further complicated to consider the raise in the steering interest rate.
"The work of the Central Bank is complicated despite what happened on the financial markets and what has happened in the last few weeks," noted Stephen D. Oliner, former Central Bank official, UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate.
He now believes that the central bank will wait at least a month to deal with the effects.
"There is great uncertainty as to what will be the effects on the US economy; there is little reliable information on the post-development of the Chinese economy," Oliner said.
The recovery of the global economy is not the central bank's main concern and should therefore in principle not affect the decision-making of the central bank.
In practice, however, the central bank is the most influential player in the world's monetary economy.
The impact of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
In 2013, Ben S. Bernanken, then president of the Bank, merely made a suggestion that the central bank could narrow down the scope of its operations, caused upheavals around the world.
In today's world, markets and economies are closely intertwined, and in addition to monitoring world developments, the central bank is also required to communicate with other central banks and experts in order to have a good overall picture of the world economy.
“The decision-making process of the central bank is more art than science,” said Zachary Karbell, Director of the Global Strategy of Envestnet Inc.
President Jeffrey Lacker of the Regional Central Bank of Richmond said this month that the central bank has previously overreacted with financial market movements that seem to have no connection with the fundamental economic pillars.
Mr Lacker, who was entitled to vote by the Federal Open Market Committee, has called for an increase in the steering interest rate, as an example of the decisions taken in 1998 and 1999.
"The economic crisis in Asia resulted in the central bank's decision to reduce the interest rate by 0.75 percentage points at three meetings, although limited recognizable penalties for US economic growth were available," Lacker said.
A year later, the central bank reversed the decision.
"The central bank should give priority to financial stability only in a major crisis, as in the 2008 economic collapse," said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England Interest Rate Committee.
The last rush doesn't even draw close to the situation at the time," he said.
"The rise in the shells is by no means worth fearing as a result of market shock," added Peterson Institute for International Economics Posen.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention monetary stability.

Brazil’s Rio Grande Children’s Medical Association promotes a good diet for breast-feeding
The Brazilian Rio Grande Children’s Doctors’ Association SPRS has developed a blinding way of teaching women the meaning of a decent diet. They are presented with images of babies being breast-feeded with images of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk is made up of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which gives the baby all the food it needs and can develop a strong immune system.
Due to the extra energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 kg.
According to the new study, in addition to increasing calories, other changes should be made to the diet.
A recent study by Professor Robert Waterland, Texas’s Baylor College of Medicine, revealed that a healthy diet of pregnant women can affect the baby’s genes and protect the baby from tumour development.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the child’s immune system.
Seven Sunris has the most viewers, even though Nine is trying to get a lead on her Today Show.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson wanted Canberra to make a morning programme on the after-elections of the Liberal Party's leader's elections, which, however, did not improve today's audiences.
The Nine Channel's morning program was sent from the capital after Malcolm Turnbull had been deported by Tony Abbott.
David Koch and Samantha Armytage's competition channel morning program was sent from London, and special weekly broadcasts are also sent from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The distance apparently did not matter to Australian television viewers, as Sunrise had an average of 397 000 viewers in five state capitals, while today’s programme was 339 000 viewers.
Today’s viewer figures increased slightly compared to last Monday (317,000) and Tuesday (283,000) but remained reading last Thursday (343 000).
Today has reached a distance to Sunris in the last few months.
In August, Today had an average of 318 000 viewers, Sunrisa had 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
In September, Sunrise has reached an average of 349 000 viewers and Today 314 000 viewers.
This is the most interesting event in the morning.
The changes in the winds will have a greater impact on Parliament this morning.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

Seven had 800 Words series with a former Packed to the Rafters star, Erik Thomson.
The new drama tells of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with two children. The new series reached a great 1 219, 000 viewers.
The critics have doubted whether Thomson's series would be sufficient to be a star alone without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's audience figures show that the answer is clearly positive.
Sevenin The X Factor maintained its strong position with 136 000 viewers. The series clearly defeated The Block (838 000) and the TBL Family series (726 000).
Seven's The Chase Australia has captured the viewers in a variety of ways.
An average of 446 000 viewers followed by Andrew O'Keefe’s first half hour (17.00 to 5.30 p.m.).
The second half-hour (17.30–18:00) the number of viewers rose to 623,000, which was more than Eddie McGuiren Hot (613,000).
On Monday night, the Chase in the first half of Australia had an average of 520 000 viewers, and the other half gathered a great 720 000 viewers.
The number of Hot Set's viewers was 620,000.
The number of viewers in The Chase Australia's second night showed the Nine Channel that Hot Seat is still passing at 5.30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minute, who was unable to challenge the McGuire series.

The final three thinks Sam Wood is really the bachelor of the Dreams – but who does the man choose?
Did the secret come out? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have deliberately revealed the choice of the bachelor of the Dreams.
The final choice of the dream bachelor Sam Wood has been a well-preserved secret.
The remaining three women do not say a word to who has received the last rose from the bachelor.
We asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Felows before they dropped one out of the triangle.
Sam Wood's lips are strictly sealed until Thursday's final.
All three women cheered up that Wood was a perfect man, and the women praised him for sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness, and considered him to be a suitable partner for themselves.
When women were asked who Wood would be the most suitable partner if the last rose did not hit its own spot, their answers could give a hint of who would take the bachelor’s heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the most suitable partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been doing well since the beginning.
"When I came to the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam were fit together. This feeling has been maintained throughout the program," said Jeavons-Felllows.
"Sarah has legs on the ground, and he's really having fun company," Markoski added.
"I've seen them together, and I have to admit there's chemistry between them.
They seem to be a couple.
Sarah Mackay thinks herself and Sam Wood are a good couple.
Mackay told me that he realized last week's hometown date that Wood could be the one.
"When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this is not just a race. I am now investing in our relationship," said Mackay.
When they asked Mackay who Wood should choose if he didn't choose him, the woman mysteriously answered:
"I can't say," he said.
"I like other girls just as much, Snezana and Lana are even."
Dream bachelor on the Ten channel at 7:30 p.m. on Wednesday.
The case was originally published in the title "Sarah Sam Wood's Selection?"
Jarryd Hayne has several options for the start of the NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayne after this changed to the United States. Several other associations also took an interest in the man after last year's impressive open training day.
Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and the choice seems to hit the button.
Some trainers would have kept Hayne on the bench, as did the man in the ranks of the Australian rugby country team. Hayne missed the victory of the return team on Tuesday from Minnesota by reading 20-3.
However, Tomsula showed confidence in Hayne and gave the man another chance to return the flight. The coach held Hayne's game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula continued her line in the locker after the game.
He didn't rush the newcomers in front of the rest of the team. He encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly defended Hayne at a post-game press conference.
49erss Special Editor Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget the failed capture and concentrate on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne in the first quarter of the game against the Minnesota Vikings.
Hayne and his Australian fans had been waiting for another man from the NFL debytes.
After the failure, Hayne left the field raining and later told Hamish and Andy the 2DayFM 104.1 channel that he could not have imagined the worst beginning of his NFL career.
"They happen, and we have to move on," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the error with her debut in the State of Origin series in 2007, when her feeding in her own area opened a place for Queensland.
The whole experience was still incredible for a young 27-year-old.
Hayne published a picture in Instagram where she poses with fans and the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin are discussing gay rights.
In 2003, the richest man in Russia was arrested with a gun at the airport in Siberia.
Hodorkovski, who interviewed President Vladimir Putin, was sentenced, Jukos, a man-owned oil company, was expelled, and his work in favour of democracy was restricted.
Four dead policemen shot with rubber bullets in Nepal.
Four people were killed in southern Nepal, and the source of authority told us on Wednesday, and the police shot a crowd in rubber bullets in the protest against the alleged new constitution of the country, and there was a four-year-old boy among the victims.
The violence happened on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh area, less than three hundred kilometers from the capital Kathmandus.
According to District Manager Bishnu Prasad Dhakali, more than 1,000 protestors had gathered outside the police station, some of which threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal told me that the police used tear gas and fired in the air before shooting rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty policemen and five civilians were wounded.
It is not entirely clear why rubber bullets, which can kill, but which are generally regarded as a less destructive alternative, were suddenly so lethal.
It was the most recent encounter in the weeks of protests on the southern plains of Nepal, where according to the Madhesi tribe, the new provinces based on the new constitution would undermine their political influence.
The protests have also been seen in Western Nepal, where the Tharus tribe requires its own country.
At least 40 people, 11 of whom are police officers, have died in violent cannons since 10 August,
This is an important step towards a new constitution, but it is very sensitive in Nepal, where administration has been centralized for centuries.
The new constitution has been worked on since 2008, but the legislators speeded up the process since thousands of people died in the shocking earthquake in April.
The legislators have voted on the constitutional clauses for Katmandus this week, and the authorities believe that a new Charter could be adopted by Sunday.
Hurricane Centre of NHC: 60 % probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde
Within the next 48 hours, the National Hurricane Center (National Hurricane Center) announced that a tropical cyclone could develop in 60% of the southernmost parts of Cape Verde, some 560 km from the wide area of low pressure.
According to the Miami Air Science Department, there is also a clear centre of low pressure in the middle of Cape Verde and the Small Antiques. It can also develop into a tropical cyclone with 60% probability over the next two days.
Google plans to raise 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc. (Googl.O.) announced that it would launch a campaign aimed at collecting 11 million dollars for humanitarian aid organisations that help thousands of people across Europe who have fled war and poverty.
Google announced the donation campaign in its blog in a very personal way.
Instead of leading, the campaign was launched by Google’s employee Rita Masoud, who was only seven years old when he fled Kabul with his family.
"We traveled on a train in the dark and on a bus, and we were starving, thirsty, cold and scared," Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
After the crisis on refugees and immigrants in Europe has accelerated, many families in similar situations urgently need help.
Donations are addressed to non-profit organisations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save Children and the United Nations Refugee Organisation.
When donations have been collected at google.com/refugeerelief through $5.5 million, Google promises to donate an equivalent amount, thus reaching the total amount of $11 million.
The European refugee crisis is then worst hit by the Second World War, particularly the four-year civil war in Syria, which has led to more than four million people running away from their homes this year.
The war also has to run from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Mildly overweight diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery
According to the new study, overweight type 2 diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether mildly overweight type 2 diabetics live longer after obesity surgery than those treated without surgery.
"It takes time to get death data," said Dr. Obesity Expert Robin Blackstone, who discussed new research in JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, reduces the stomach bag by different methods.
Surgical methods reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food in the body.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been found to be effective treatments for type 2 diabetes. However, the majority of the studies have affected patients with morbid overweights with a body mass index (BMI) of at least 35.
The weight index shall indicate for weight and length, with a normal value between 18,5 and 24,9.
When the body weight index is over 25, the person is overweight and the body weight index over 30 indicates significant obesity.
You can calculate your own weight index at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 in a study comparing two methods of obesity surgery, gastric bypass surgery and joint surgery, treatment of type 2 diabetes with mildly fat individuals.
After obesity surgery, the mean body weight index decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of study.
The weight index of patients treated without surgery was maintained within 29 hours.
In surgical patients, the overall improvement in diabetes was 36% and partly 28%.
In the treatment group, diabetes was completely improved by only 1% and partly by only around 2%.
The study also showed that blood pressure, triglycerides, and poor LDL cholesterol were better in the surgical treatment group.
Patients were also monitored for haemoglobin A1c levels, which reflects the development of blood glucose levels.
According to the investigators, the recommended level of haemoglobin A1c is less than 7%.
After surgery, haemoglobin A1c decreased from an average of 9% to 6%.
In the treatment group, the values remained unchanged at around 8%.
However, a study group led by Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu found that this did not reduce mortality over five years.
The study group also compared the consequences of two different methods of surgery.
In the fifth year of the gastric bypass surgery group, weight loss was higher than that of the sleeve surgery group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), weight index drop was greater (7.4 and 5.1), and haemoglobin A1c levels (3.1% and 2.1%).
However, according to a Swedish study in Blackstone, the University of Arizona College of Medicine, Phoenix University, however, the course of surgery brings many years of life to fat people.
In a Swedish study, fat subjects undergoing gastric bypass surgery had a 29% reduction in the probability of death over 15 years compared to the conventional treatment group.
However, although no lower mortality was observed in the new study, Blackstone confirmed that persons with a body weight index below 35 could benefit from the measure.
"This is the most important finding in the study, because it says that surgery is safe in the lower body weight index group, and does not increase the risk of death or kidney disease", Blackstone wrote.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should take weight seriously when the body mass index is between 27 and 30.
"We wait too long for people to take the situation seriously," the researcher said.
"When genetic changes have emerged in the human body that expose obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation."
"Everything can't come to Europe" Dalai Lama – RT News
Europe is not capable of receiving all the refugees, and the Dalai Lama has said that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leader in Tibetan Buddhism has called for the end of violence in the refugees' countries.
The Dalai Lama debated the refugee crisis in his visit to the United Kingdom. The Dalai Lama spoke at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion, Oxford, which focuses on ethical research.
According to the Dalai Lama, in the current situation humanity must be put ahead of individual countries or continents.
He also stressed that although the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is to be admired, it is not enough in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe", the Dalai Lama said in her speech.
Although the Dalai Lama thanked Germany and Austria for their response to the crisis, he stressed that the solution was only temporary.
"The care of thousands of refugees is a wonderful thing to do, but at the same time, there are thoughtful long-term solutions and how we can achieve genuine peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education," the Dalai Lama emphasised.
"In the end, we must consider how we can reduce the number of killings in these countries.
The use of power must be reduced.
Power has never solved problems," he added.
As regards violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions in connection with the September 11 terrorist attacks and claimed that, in response to the terrorist attack, the United States had created an uncontrolled chain of events.
"After the attacks of 11 September, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution would be made through non-violence.
I know his purpose was good, but he used the force that had unpredictable consequences," Dalai-lama said.
Ingestion of hands in children quadrupled in four years
According to Georgia’s poisoning centre, poisoning centers across the United States report almost quadruple in cases of alcohol abuse in children under 12 years of age since 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, the Director of the Poison Center in Georgia, the cases of swallowing of the intoxication centres in children under 12 years of age increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"These products are increasingly accessible to children, and unfortunately some of them are first aided," Lopez told CNN.
According to Lopez, children drink concepts for purpose, some to impress their friends and some to impress social media.
YouTube videos show teenagers who drink disinfectant because of cheap hops.
It is reported that teenagers mix alcoholic mouthwash with a disinfectant to make drinking stronger.
Smaller children can be attracted to the smell of handicrafts.
"The child doesn't think it's bad," Lopez said.
"A large part of attractive handicrafts has just been perfumed.
There are hand-flavoured products of strawberries, grapes and orange that appeal to children."
The alcoholic strength by volume of disinfectants shall be between 45 % and 95 %.
For young children, a small number may cause alcohol poisoning.
"The alcohol content of the hands is very high", Stephen Thornton, the medical director of Kansas University Hospital Poison Center, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
"No one would leave whiskey hot in front of the children, but if hand disinfectant products are often left in front of the children, they will quickly get a large amount of alcohol."
Six - year - old Nhaija Russell recently enjoyed four lyric strawberries in school, and the girl was delivered for first aid.
"The alcohol content of the girl's blood was 179, which is twice that of the adult drunk limit," says Dr. Chris Ritchey of the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Nhaiyah sopers and couldn't walk when they brought him to the emergency room.
Doctors were watching the girl's condition overnight in a separate children's hospital for brain damage, for she had fallen and hit her head after drinking alcohol," Ritchey told.
"Your account was really scary," Nhaijah's mother, Ortoria Scott, said to CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products and disinfectants in addition to having to move your hands beyond the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some of the disinfectants have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two of the Ontarion women died after swallowing hands that contained toxic substances that had not been reported.
The health authorities considered that the product contained lethal methanol instead of ethyl alcohol, although the latter was indicated in the summary of product characteristics as an active substance.
According to the police report, three fourth - grade students in the north of New York State were planning to kill a "bad" teacher in January by placing antibacterial products around the classroom.
The teacher is very allergic to the handles and told him not to bring it to the classroom.
The police thought that the plan that had gone missing was meaningless and called on the school to take disciplinary action.

The Griffiths have sidelined the rumors of the indiscretion in the Celtic ranks. According to their own words, Griffiths and his teams are not subject to surveillance when preparing to meet the Dutch serial leader.
"I don't think we're under any pressure, and I think the players are waiting to meet.
The Dutch want an old Scottish battle couple – de Boer
The former Rangers’ midfield player and Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer have stated that the interest of Dutch football fans in Celtic has been stolen, as the double struggles between Celtic and Rangers are no longer possible.
De Boer, who works for the Ajax team, said: "The management no longer presents the highlight of the Celtic games. Why?
Because the Rangers are no longer involved."
"It's not just the Rangers' return that we're talking about here.
We're talking about Old Firm.
The Dutch need double-actions between teams.
The Old Firm games have a huge tension, and they are also interested beyond the borders of Scotland."
I'm turning it around, Deila assures me.
RONNY Deila admits that Celtic is having a hard time, but the Norwegian trust assures us that the situation will change.
Malmölle's lost club fell from the League of Masters and lost ten players to Aberdeen, who now has a five-point lead at the top of the table.
"Celtic's had difficult episodes before, and we're getting up again," Deila said.
"We want to improve our situation as soon as possible.
The situation is very frustrating, and it causes anger or sorrow in many people.
So are we, but we have to move on.
We urgently need the support of the Celtic supporters, because it strengthens the players considerably.
It's really important now to have a life together."
Warburton with caution in January players' transfers
Although only a few weeks ago, the Rangers boss Mark Warburton suggested that January bets were being transferred, he is cautious about the transfer roll and says that he wants to compromise the team's unity.
"The players' transfers in January are significantly different from summer transfers", Brentford's ex-trainer said.
"The team-related players will be able to get used to the team before the beginning of the season, which has succeeded in this season in our composition.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes unnecessary gambling can harm the team more than benefits."
Michu, the goal of Celtic, is to think about living.
The Swansea attacker, Michu, has been connected to Celtic in the playoffs, but Michu has been suggesting retirement since the end of the Swans agreement.
A 29-year-old Michu has been an abominable ankle for years, and he failed to get a transfer from Wales in the summer.
Hearts ready for the SFA battle with Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field. The team finally lost 3-2. The defenseman's red card was cancelled later. It's already the third Collum red card in eight months, which will be cancelled.
But Neilson stays behind his words. "I did not question honesty. I did not comment on the performance.
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle
The Griffiths were rebuked when a man gave his grim songs to his lorries about a former Hearts player named Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in the pubs in the Edinburgh Roseburn region before the Edinburgh local match in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"There was a local fight, and the mood was intense," said the attacker. "I can guarantee I'm not going back to Tynecastle except in the Celtic lines."
Tannadice’s Executive Board believes in Dundee United’s Coaching Board – Donnelly
Simon Donnelly assures us that the Dundee United Board of Directors can turn the situation into a better one.
"Staphen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready to fight," Donnelly said.
McInnes welcomes Hamilton's victory with a dirty game
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdeen was desperate to hold against Hamilton for his seventh consecutive league victory.
"There is no cup or league winning team that would not have won such games," McInnes said.
Unemployment unchanged in Scotland, growing in the British islands
The number of unemployed persons in Scotland remained unchanged in May to July. There are 164 000 unemployed in the whole of the United Kingdom. The number of unemployed persons increased by 10 000 at the same time.
According to the Office for National Statistics, the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9 per cent, compared to 5.5 per cent in the United Kingdom as a whole.
There are 12 000 people working in Scotland less than three months earlier. The number of people working is now 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0% in the quarter, with the United Kingdom as a whole having an average employment rate of 73.5%.
The Scottish Minister for Affairs David Mundell commented on recent figures: "The long-term management plan has created a basis for a strong economy."
Almost exactly a year ago, Scotland made a historic decision to preserve it as part of the United Kingdom.
The labour market situation in Scotland has improved over the past year: unemployment has decreased.
Why am I following a execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, unless there is a legal basis for cancellation, I will follow the execution.
If the execution is carried out, what I do not hope, I will sit in the execution room of the state of Oklahoma state prison when Richard Glossip is executed with a poison injection.
I've been asked by Glossip to be one of four official witnesses.
I received an invitation in January through a man’s best friend and despite my shock, I answered the invitation with yes.
As the day draws near, I'm terrified.
Then why did I say yes?
I agreed because I thought I could tell you a true story about the death penalty.
The angle of vision would be unique.
Journalists will be able to follow executions in the United States, and since there are more applications than there are places, the participants will be selected with macaber value.
Oklahoma has reduced suppliers from 12 to 5.
The chosen will follow the execution moderately.
I can't do it.
I'm sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends. I've created a man's personal relationship because we've been on the phone several times in months, and one of my visits lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
According to the prison staff, I cannot be present as both a witness and a journalist, so I am not allowed to bring in a notebook and pen to make notes.
I just have to try to put the details in my mind.
I was accused on Twitter of jeopardising neutrality.
"The basic idea is this:
When you tell a condemned story in a way that pleases him, you get close to him."
I gave the reporter my dissenting opinion.
The reporter admitted that she could have formulated her words more carefully, but she still felt that my actions were wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He doesn't tell me what I'm writing, and even if he was trying to tell me what I'm writing, I wouldn't.
I've told him he can remove me from the witness list at any time.
However, he wants an international journalist who can write about what happened.
If Glossip dies, he believes that the public will promote the movement against the death penalty.
Huffington Post journalist Kim Bellware will sit next to me.
If you want more information on the subject, you can listen to my podcast.
I am not going to repeat the details in this context.
I can't say Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would make him guilty of a crime.
However, I believe that it is very likely that Mr. Glossip has not committed murder.
I absolutely believe that there was insufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
I believe his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I will follow his execution.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
You can read an unbiased description of other suppliers' cases.
I'll tell you what it feels like to watch a man die in vain.
The man was lured from the Canning River after a watery police hunt.
The officer in the Canning Vale area remained dry when he lured a man up from the Canning River.
The Perthian man's escape attempt pushed him down into a shallow, muddy water, a few meters away, the police got the man grounded back to dry land.
The Canning Vale police got a call on Tuesday about an unauthorized stay in Beckenham.
When the police arrived, they found a suspect trying to punish the police by heading for the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"The man standing in the water said he wouldn't come out of the water and told the police to get him," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
The watering of Officer Lachlan Perhavec's uniform was not attractive, so he chose safer tactics – negotiation.
"At one point, an escape attempt makes a person resort to amusing means," Sergeant Castledine said.
The case of the football master Ben Thomas is an impressive example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing the police and tried to swim across the Swan River.
The man’s attempt was doomed, but the pace inspired the locals to design the Ben Thomas biathlon.
According to Peter Moody, the experts were spying on him, and he's threatening to stop competing.
Peter Moody blames Racing Victoria's agents for the spying attempt being held last year, and he threatened to stop competing immediately.
Moody claims that the agents and Racing Victoria's integrity department have personally attacked him, and the rejection of Lady Tatai because of the treatment recently given on the day of the race was the last drop on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to compete for the sport, and Moody was in a difficult situation when we found a cobalt in Lidar's sample, and he couldn't explain the finding.
Moody has kept his tongue under control for a year and a half, and he did not want the accusations to appear to be a bitter man.
"I wasn't going to bring it up. I've been thinking about this for a long time, but sometimes frustration breaks down with one-offs," Moody said.
"They know what really happened."
"Sometimes I have to react and accept the consequences. Now I have to accept the state after I open my mouth.
I'm gonna go home and sleep well tonight.
I want to go up, and I want the horse owners to think I'm doing my best.
If the owners don't believe it, I don't want to go on as a horse coach anymore.
I'd have to think about my future as a licensed coach."
Moody dropped the bomb earlier at the race.com interview where he told me about the integrity department's spying attempts at his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a man a job at my stable with the aim of spying on my actions.
"They clearly believe I'm a fraud.
If so, they should present the evidence, for I have not been caught up in any unauthorised act.
The former Chairman of the RVL, Robert Roulston, the current Chairman of the RVL, David Moodi and the current CEO of the RVL, Bernard Saundery were aware of the activities at that time and now.
Should I consider the situation a personal chase?
Should the RVL take real action and impose responsibility on non-trainers in the sector?
Am I a nuisance to the business?
Am I really a nuisance to the business?
Maybe that's what a lot of people think.
Maybe I'd still have a training license and push me out of my assignment, and there's no doubt I'm gonna make a lot of people think that way with what I'm saying.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore.
It's really sad.
I'm gonna press on them to make their own decisions.
My family supports me, and I can withdraw."
The long - lasting investigation of Lidar’s cognitive values and the recent rejection situation caused the coach to end up being frustrated so that he threatened to give up his license.
Moody is best known as the coach of unbeatable champion Black Caviar. The man described the day-to-day management rule as ridiculous after the horse had an irregular clay roll on its feet.
"The treatment is against the rules.
I take full responsibility for that," Moody said.
"The person of my personality wrongly put clay on the horse's leg.
We could have done clay treatment last night.
It could have been done last day, and that's what happened.
But it happened on the day of the race."
Moody can be expected to have a three-month non-competition ban on non-compliance with the rules, which the organisers have begun to deal with.
"This is a joke.
The rules have been drawn up by someone who doesn't know horses at all.
Everyone understands that the rules are necessary, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Arrested off Cobram's crash scene
The police have arrested a guy who ran away from the crash scene during the weekend of the biker.
The biker was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, and he was seriously injured by a car crash in Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
According to the police, a man driving a car escaped the scene and didn't stay to help an injured biker.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia signed up for Shepparton Police.
The man is likely to be charged with non-compliance with the obligation to stop and assist in the event of a traffic accident and other traffic offences.
A 40 - year - old cyclist from Cobra is still in hospital, and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy refers to the china of opponents in the wrestling talks
Coach Craig Bellamy, in the Melbourne Storm, considers the criticism of his team's anti-tank game to be the purposeful action of the two leagues of the NRL.
According to Trent Robinson, coach of Sydney Roosters, the judges gave Storm the pressure to be upset by Melbourne’s masters in a fight to fight back in Sydney on Friday night.
Mr. Wayne Bennett, coach of the Brisbane Broncos, barely covered the reference to Storm Broncos after winning the Carsintafinal in Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night.
Bellamy defended her own team's fighting game and said they were just focused on contact while fighting.
Bellamy added that his confidence in his own team was increased by the fact that the two top team coachs criticise his team. Bellamy considers this to be an indication that the coach is concerned about the loss of Storm.
"This thing always comes up. I remember Trent Robinson didn't say anything about the pressure when his team won us 24-2", Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I guarantee you, we haven't changed anything about our defense system or technology all year round.
Trent's been on the mission for three years, and the loss could have been a shock to him because he's got a great team that's not used to losing.
It's funny that the same thing always comes out at the same time of the year.
Bellamy did not agree with Bennett about what is an interesting football. He reminded his mentor that Bennett’s St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing boring football.
"Wayne's talking about interesting football.
He compared his own team from Saturday to our Friday game and thought their game was interesting," Bellamy said.
"In 2010, St. Georgea received a lot of criticism for her boring game. Wayne said that the criticism would not even stop him.
Now he has a team that is able to play so-called football, especially his young people, with his quick central protagonists.
That's the kind of football you want to play when the player's arsenal is like this.
He stressed this in 2010 and now he wants everyone to play in his style. All teams have no central players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
This gives me more confidence when other coaches are so concerned about meeting my team that they're turning to this.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think they'd meet us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that there were more goals in Storm and Roosters than there were in Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game. I haven’t seen it, but what was the result? 16-12?
The final result of our game was 20-18. There were more situations in our game, but is it interesting football?
Or are game breaks and minority interesting football?
I think the goals make it interesting.
If they mention us, we'll probably meet them."
The Storm has a free weekend, as the team will be invited to visit either the North Queensland Cowboys Cronu on Saturday next Saturday at AAMI Park. Tickets will be sold on Tuesday morning.
Serbian man released against $200,000 bail in a drug case
A 40 kilo of cocaine trafficking smuggled to Queensland has been released from bail for $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month by the police on a 100-pound cocaine shipment from Solay, who had come through Vanuatu from South America and arrived at the port of Coomera in August.
The police were watching Maximovic and his partner at the boating port for the morning, and then two more days later, they found 40 kilos of drugs in the Toyoa Echo car in the parking lot.
Although Maximovicia is waiting for a possible life-long possession of drugs for commercial purposes, according to the husband’s lawyer there is no evidence that his client would have tried to get the whole batch, but he could have been in the cafe for innocent purposes.
According to the Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan, there is a risk that Maximovic will try to escape the country.
"Maximovic clearly has links with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," said the judge in court on Wednesday.
"He lied to the police about his place of residence."
Together, Maximovic’s mother and stepfather paid 200 000 guarantees against which the man was released.
"After reading the sworn certificates of both persons, it is clear that the $200,000 will be a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
"But that alone is not enough to prevent a man from escaping," the judge warned.
Maximovic was released on condition that he surrenders his passports from Australia and Serbia, reports daily to the police and stays home from 6 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to get the pedophiles to send pictures.
The paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to get access to pictures of children being abused.
Stevan Hogg took her phone while she was sleeping and logged in to an online message service where she got another user to send herself inappropriate pictures of children.
Later, after she woke up, the girl noticed that her phone was gone and that she was sleeping in Hogg's hand.
When he explained the contents of his phone, she found shocking messages and immediately told her mother.
The police were informed of these five images, and after searching the computers at the address, the police found disturbing Internet searches using data to search for inappropriate child images.
Hogg claimed to the police that he was trying to mislead pedophiles on the Internet and that he was playing the police to scare pedophiles.
The prosecutor, Eilith Robertson, said at the local judiciary in Dundee Sheriff Court: "The man claimed to be dependent on the intimidation of people.
He admitted that he had done a search on a computer, but claimed that he did so in order to play the police, thereby scaring the pedophiles.
Hogg was asked about discussions with an unknown person who had sent the pictures to him and from whom Hogg had asked for more pictures.
Hogg claimed that his purpose was to mislead paedophiles.
He told me he got disturbing thoughts when he drank and wanted to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added, "After he found the messages on the phone, the girl screamed at her mother shaking and crying."
She saw the inappropriate pictures on the phone, and then Hogg was questioned.
The girl told me the defendant used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than himself.
23-year-old Hogg Dundeen from Ward Road confessed to the charges of holding inappropriate child pictures on 14 June last year. Hogg broke his release against bail on 25 January this year and refused to enter the court for consultation on 24 March this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg should not be placed in the sexual offenders’ register, since it could be considered that the offence did not contain significant sexual characteristics.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence to October for background social work reports.
Hogg was granted immunity from bail in this case, but was held in detention on other grounds.
Hogg was added to the sexual offenders' register even before the date of the sentence.
Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe, is giving the wrong speech in Parliament
The oldest Head of State in Africa, Mugabe, fell on the steps leading to the speaker’s high - pitch earlier this year.
Mugabe wasn't injured, but the video of what happened quickly spread in social media.
The opening of Parliament was also shattered by claims made by the co-legislators of the opposition party that they have received anonymous threats of death, in which they are warned not to bug Mugabe during his speech.
In the last month, the representatives of the peoples were hurling and interrupting the speech on the state of the President in Parliament, and the President gave the same speech on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, a bishop of the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change), said that seven opposition politicians received text messages calling on them not to interfere with Mugabe's speeches.
"The message has been sent from an unknown number, but the message title is "death", Gonese told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
The message alerts recipients to the fact that representatives outside Parliament are no longer immune.
According to the party's bishop, the party led by Morgan Tsvangira is concerned about threats against politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard intends to reduce 25 000 to 30 000 jobs as part of restructuring and saving operations in business services.
HP is divided into two listed companies later this year and distinguishes computer and printer business from faster growing enterprise hardware and service operations.
According to HP’s press release, the company will record a lump sum of USD 2.7 billion in costs from the fourth quarter onwards.
"Restructures allow a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," explained Meg Whitman, CEO of HP, who manages the company after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more focused company than the current HP, and we have a wide and deep portfolio of business activities that will help companies move into a new business style" Whitman said.
"As our own company, our position is better than ever, and we can better meet the changing needs of our customers around the world."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s annual turnover is over $50 billion and the company is focusing on delivering unique integrated technology solutions to companies, according to its mission.
The company created by the University of Stanford, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, who were raised in the 1930s, is now divided into two companies.
The HP has undergone massive restructuring when moving from traditional desktop computers to mobile devices.
The second largest computer manufacturer in the world and the HP of the largest technology companies in the United States is the latest move in a sector that believes that concentration will bring success.
Captain Arsenal Mikel Arteta: The team must support the injured Jack Wilshere before he meets Dinamo Zagreb.
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is only September. If everything goes on with the rehabilitation plan, there is no reason why he cannot return to the field already in December.
The best possible scenario means that Wilshere will certainly have to miss at least the next four national teams in England.
The biggest problem with the latest problem is that Wilshere decided to last season strongly after the worst and seemed to have returned to his former steel during the new season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten your career," Wenger said.
"The bone didn't heal properly.
It's not a serious injury.
This was just an accident.
It had nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries."
Medically, this may be the case, but as Wenger also said, additional injuries can come when the player tries to return to the field during the season.
There is also a noticeable unpleasant compliance.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different difficulties since Wilshere debuted six years ago.
He also played in Arsenal's ranks only 65 out of 157 leagues in the last five seasons.
The broader picture of Arsenal is that since 2007-2008, six out of eight seasons have been one of the teams that lost money most due to injuries.
Wenger accepts a possible vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that the statistics on injury that have improved in the past period will continue to develop in a better direction.
"Sometimes a return after injury can be accompanied by a vulnerable period, when the body needs to be strengthened and competition authorities sought," Wenger said.
"Jack's young, so he'll be all right.
I hope that he will balance his body, and I believe in it, and that will continue his career as he deserves."
Arsenal will start his work on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, and then the team will meet Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday. Wenger will prepare for small changes in the composition.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to begin.
Wenger can also put together a start-up meeting to replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroudin Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to take care of the team's balance and give those who need it rest," Wenger mentioned.
Although Arsenal is a clear favorite for the continuation of Group F, Maximir Zagreb is one of Europe's most frightening stadiums.
Dinamo has also been undefeated for the 41-game-time team.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night when the country was shaking at 3.2 on the Richter scale.
The 10th quake was in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned his lesson in the last season since he had to bend to Monaco, and he is still motivated by a distant hope of shooting a team towards the European Championship.
"We have a huge energy charge," Wenger said.
"We haven't hit this title yet.
On the other hand, we were very close in 2006.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers."
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us the truth about friendship between men
A similar description shines in other series of absences, especially when it is noted that men's need to open up is greater than ever and young men's suicide statistics are up to 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the most significant cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain. Suicide is three times more common among men than women.
Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) finds itself facing the problem by declaring the 2015 men's year. The campaign aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking the help they need.
Friendliness is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
In a recent study, 2,000 high school students were interviewed. The study shows that those suffering from depression are more likely to be cured if there are enough healthy people around them.
The likelihood of illness for non-symptomatic persons was also half-like if there were people in their immediate vicinity who had no mental health problems.
But friendship is the basis for everything.
Modern communication is dominated by social media, and communication style is often more important than content. Rapid response is often considered more important than meaningful contact.
With the digitalisation of life, the need seems to be strong, fun and successful, even though isolation is a reality.
External values, money, image and social status associated with superficial success, all of which draw attention from internal values and our natural desire for personal growth and friendship. Internal values are more deeply influenced by our mental health.
A millionaire in the video game recently stated that money cannot actually buy happiness.
The beauty of the Frendis was that the series turned the focus onto the top.
None of the characters in the series were defined by the profession but by personality.
The series was humorously played by Joey and Chandler, hugging or watching football on their TV chairs. We also often saw Ross miss Rachel. It was clear that the men could relate to this even though they did not refrain from knowing her fully.
One volunteer explained this to me: "When I hear people depressed and thinking about suicide, it has become clear to me how much the smallest reactions of friends can mean.
The men who contact us often cannot speak to their friends.
The traditional idea that men should cope is strong. The man is easily considered weak if he speaks of his problems."
"Frendit is one of the series of long-term survival mechanisms.
In a series of small moments of friendship between men were highlighted.
I can offer help from outside as a desperate moment, but long-term support is provided from a close circle of friends and family."
In honor of Comedy Central's FriendsFest, the sets of the series have been raised to life, so if you're going to attend this weekend, you should take your friends to the Central Perk for coffee.
Or do something even better. Smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks.
You never know how important a friendship can be.
Comedy Central sends the entire Frendit series – all 236 episodes – #FriendsFest
Di Maria's hit helped PSG defeat Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan after he scored against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria succeeded in the goal performance of the Masters League in her debut and helped PSG to hit the Swedish team in Malmo on Tuesday.
Read the game report and review.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were hit when Paris Saint-Germain began his work in the Champions League by hitting the Malmön Parc des Princes stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored after the debut game had been played for less than four minutes. She confirmed the position of the French champions immediately in hand. However, PSG pushed several goals before they could finally increase their lead: Cavani painted after the game had been played for 60 minutes.
In Section A there are also Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish champion. PSG not only aims for the next round in the playoffs, but also wants to improve its position for the quarter-ranges in the remaining three games.
Although SPG got the points, the match was not a perfect performance of a team shot by Laurent Blanc. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost his place of goals and the man was switched when he was faced with his former home company, where he started his great career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or at guests in the Champions League, so the 2-0 victory and good take-offs will give us a good basis, although we still have a delusional season," Blanc said.
"This one knows good.
We were thirsty for victory and we were able to do it, but I'm sorry we couldn't do one or two extra goals."
Ibrahimovic returned to the team after he was injured. During the weekend, the team had to be satisfied with 2-2 matches in the Ligue 1 series against Bordeaux. However, Di Maria left Ibrahimovic in her shadow for four minutes.
Last month, an Argentinian pier who moved from Manchester United to PSG ranks was appointed a PSG solver who will raise the team to a new level in Europe.
However, those waiting for PSG’s crushing victory were disappointed.
Malmö defeated Celtic in the playoffs, marched nine international players to the field from the start. The five-man defense and two-man tactics team had to be difficult to win.
Nikola Djurjic's shooting barely passed the back of Kevin Trapp's goal in the 34th minute of the game. The team didn't attack very actively.
Instead, PSG fell into vain feeding and weak finishing, not least Ibrahimovic, who lost five goals only in the first half. At the beginning of the second half Ibrahimovic kick fed the goal to the wigs of Cavani.
However, Ibrahimovic showed his nails in the pitcher game. Di Maria shot the spinster past Wiland at 52 minutes.
The second goal was created during the Count's time thanks to Cavan, and the sixth-playing suburb shot the full-time when Ibrahimovic fed him a left-winger at Maxwell's kick.
Malmö's letter ended with another goal, and only Wiland's top-notch, David Luiz's near range, to shoot, had to contain the readings, and Ezequiel Lavez's goal from the bench was abandoned in the end of the forest.
Malmö's pilot Åge Hareide later admitted that PSG was his own class. "We played the previous Championship league game last December.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, where the level is not the same.
It's not enough to run.
A hat lift for the Parisian.
This was a match from them."
Glencore collects $2.5 billion with a share
The Swiss miner Glencore, which was tried by lowering raw material prices, raised USD 2.5 billion in Wednesday’s share capital as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, stated in its opinion that he had sold new shares at around GBP 1.6 billion to reduce the debt.
The company's market value fell by 57 % this year, with a fall in raw material prices, when the recession in the Chinese economy undermines demand and puts pressure on the market.
As a result of the stock issue, Glencore’s share price fell to the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning.
The share rose by 2.77% to 131.60 in the FTSE 100 index, which opened up to 0.69 percent.
Glencore announced last week its intention to raise $2.5 billion in equity as part of a strategy to reduce its debt of $30 billion by a third.
The company sold new shares to the price of 125 pn, which represents a decrease of 2.4 per cent from the end-of-sale price on Tuesday.
The company issued 1.3 billion shares with a total value of up to 9.99 per cent of the total group.
The concern about the continuation of the Chinese economy has caused the price of iron ore to collapse, while the fall in coal, copper and other assets has been 20-40 %.

I don't think he'll be able to talk about it any more.
He's just happy with his performance.
He's had a lot of praise from fans.
