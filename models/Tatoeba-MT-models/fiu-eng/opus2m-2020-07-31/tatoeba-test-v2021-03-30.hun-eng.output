The cloud is a large amount of humidity in the sky.
Tom is one of the best singers I've ever heard.
We've been studying French for three years now.
Mary has a good-looking husband.
Tomi's been pretending for a while.
There was a storm and the snow began to roll through the road.
I think your job is really good.
There's a problem.
The day seemed to be in one place.
Who thinks so?
You're not gonna put them next to you with insults.
Tom's fishing too.
Tom's nose started itchy.
Tom bought Mary a drink.
The young woman was so beautiful that even the devil wanted to marry her.
He's the reason I missed my bus.
I'm gonna put a place on my mouth so I don't talk anything out.
We have to act now.
You want me to take you home?
Tom's hopeless.
Have you ever followed law enforcement?
I'm not the coach.
It's very boring.
It's too cold to swim.
My hobby is collecting old games.
Tomi had to rest.
Mary's pregnant.
I teach Chinese.
Sometimes that's what it is.
Can I have it?
The flower I saw in the park yesterday was a raphesis.
Everything happened fast.
I'm satisfied with Tomi.
We have a cloudy day.
We tried to warn them.
I'm proud of Tom.
His faith is strong.
He's studying history at the university.
He used her.
He likes to pull out the electrical equipment.
You were rude.
It was really fun.
Tamás is a collector.
They love my mom.
I don't have time to gossip.
Don't forget to write it to me.
Everyone worked hard.
Where do you live in Turkey?
Blue looks good on you.
Who did you go there with?
The design of the theatre enabled the audience to get close to the performers and to establish contacts.
I couldn't move my arms.
Excuse me, can you help me?
I can understand.
Can you hold on for a few minutes?
Five hundred books, I'm sure they do.
Did the mailman ever get here?
That'll help a little bit.
It was a wonderful day.
When are you getting married?
He's been trying to call Maria Tamás countless times.
Let go of the handle.
Maria's a doctor.
Is this your money?
I don't get used to this kind of treatment.
Now the kids can't tell the difference between the hen and the cow.
Tamás is a music teacher.
My mother measured my fever.
Please follow me.
Get out!
Am I wrong?
Tom was pale.
Tamás is wonderful.
I already know.
I appreciate what Tom did for me.
Tomi's happy she's finished.
Why are you climbing that tree?
He led me to the palace.
There's a woman there who wants to talk to you.
They told him to stand up, and he did.
That's the point.
We respect them very much.
How do I get to the airport?
Tom's doing almost anything for money.
You need some rest.
It's a nice day.
You just have to work harder.
That smells good.
We need a change.
It takes about 10,000 hours to learn a language thoroughly.
It's been two years since he left me.
He lost all his money.
It's not hard.
I came to Tokyo three years ago, and I've been living here ever since.
He's innocent.
Can you turn on the light?
They warned him not to be late for school again.
I was looking for the key.
Tom saw it.
It's all clear!
Where did you stay in Boston?
Tom was walking.
His main attraction is his character, not his books.
Every car in this garage is Tomie's.
That sentence is too long!
How much for the gold ring?
History is written by the winners.
He's a lawyer.
I wish you hadn't looked like you were having a good time.
Would you like to have dinner with me?
I'd love to write hundreds of sentences on Tatoeban, but I'm busy.
I'll pay you later.
Tomi needed water.
I work every day except for Sunday.
Tom's red.
It's not your fault, is it?
My big toes are getting insensitive.
You don't have to try.
Tom put his money in the bank.
Tom was great.
There's always room for repair.
Tom was badly hit.
That should be banned.
Alcohol is prohibited in the field of university.
Your name was third on the list.
There's nothing I can do about this.
Tomi took a cab to the hospital.
No doubt you're right.
They almost completely destroyed the beavers in this country.
I have no idea who that is.
The girl swept up next to me.
She loves you.
Are you Hungarians?
My cat's black.
Now I'm fishing.
He tried to hide his concerns under his veins.
He's back here with some friends.
Tom works on Park Street.
We have a lot of snow in the winter.
Can your wife speak French?
I've been waiting for your answer, but you haven't heard from me.
There's no need for Tom to come if he doesn't want to.
We're going back there again.
No matter what you say, I won't listen to you.
Take it seriously.
The ping-pong is also called table tennis.
Mata's drunk.
Please go away.
Get your hands off my daughter!
Watch your head.
He doesn't drink coffee.
I'm a little tired.
Forget it.
We're poor, but we're happy.
I respect Tom.
It's all dark out there.
Have you heard from him lately?
We'll wait three hours.
Apparently, Tom was late because he was a traffic jam on road 19.
How did Tom answer?
Your profession is a dentist.
It's Uncle Tom's farm.
Good night, Mom.
I think I have time to do that before Tom gets here.
I can't imagine getting married.
Everyone says food in this restaurant is very good.
Do you know what your children are eating?
Looks like it was just yesterday that we went to school together.
Mari loves children.
The team will be ready.
I wasn't ready for that then.
They all expressed their regret for her death.
What was the problem?
It's basically your fault.
Slow down.
One of the twins is alive, but the other is dead.
You can e-mail me the file.
We need help up here.
It's free on Sunday.
Tom hid the evidence.
Stay away!
I warned Tom.
The dog was dead.
I've never heard her lie.
We didn't know which train was coming.
We don't love our neighbors, and they don't love us either.
He's the only one who survived.
I'm on a bus to work.
I think Tom might be older than me.
Now they're finalized.
The vase broke into a thousand pieces.
I'll give you a local anaesthetic.
See you this weekend.
People can be so rude.
They're discreet.
We understand each other.
Tom would help us if he could.
You should have followed Tomi's orders.
My wife and I like to play chess.
Tom hit me wrong.
Count to 1-10.
Someone stole my money.
Tamás, what's wrong?
Bringing in clothes from Turkey.
Are you wearing this kimono?
Do you have a fire?
Find me a good book from the library.
Tom's gonna stay.
Are you a nudist?
It's never happened before.
Why don't you get yourself a sweater?
Whose bag is this?
Mari's refurbished a house.
I wish I hadn't seen such a horrible movie.
I read this story in a book.
Please spell your name.
Sorry I'm late.
Tom ignored my advice.
He's got a lot of history books.
Don't give me anything.
Moderate exercise stimulates blood circulation.
Everything's fine in the office.
You want some orange juice?
I want a coffee.
He couldn't cope with the new circumstances.
That's true love.
It must have been stolen.
We'll leave as soon as the rain stops.
Here you go, Tom.
You don't have any tension.
He drinks too much alcohol.
You could really fix the mistake you found in the sentence.
Who'd the baby hit?
The monster is alive, awake and hungry.
The price of the houses went up.
To me, your friendship is of great value to me.
He's playing baseball after school.
I never eat meat.
We still have to know the truth.
Mari closed her eyes and started counting squirrels.
Tom drugged Mary.
Do you understand me in French?
We don't need science to connect a personal computer to the Internet.
It took me an hour.
I forgot.
Stay with me, Tom.
That's not right.
I don't think Tom's ever learned French.
I'm so glad you could make it.
Even Tom wouldn't be stupid enough to ask Mary.
We don't like fate.
What happened last week?
Tom's raising weight.
I'm blowing this song from the outside.
I want to do everything.
We appreciate your ability.
Tomi was telling me about a crane from the napkin.
Can you do this yourself?
Tom said he didn't see anything.
Take an aspirin.
She's at school.
Are you deliberately trying to confuse me?
I volunteered.
Tom will answer all your questions.
You're gonna need an alibi.
You cut yourself out.
The sentences give a sense of meaning, the sentences have personality, they can be funny, they can be smart, they can be dumb, they can be sharp, they can be moving, they can be offensive.
No, it's not.
My book isn't here.
Tom's coming home next week.
Mary told me she enjoyed the concert.
Why do you keep talking to me?
The sun rises eastward and lies westward.
Tom's moving out.
They eat healthy food.
He felt trapped.
This song reminds me of my childhood.
I wrote you a song.
Get one of them.
You coward!
Whose pen is this?
Who am I lucky for?
Is that mandatory?
Tom didn't seem as busy as usual.
They're killers.
Tom's really drunk.
Who cares?
I can't imagine how I could live without him.
Japanese is my native language.
I intend to go there.
I think Tom's been there.
Tom's too dependent on Mari.
The boy complimented everyone on his new bike.
Tom is a respected astronomer.
I'm not your father.
Hope is always alive.
My mom loves football.
I'm fine.
I've never seen Tom dance.
There's nothing here.
I've never seen Tom drink before.
The kids are already in bed.
I ate too much yesterday.
It's over there.
Tom was quiet.
It was a joke.
He was no longer dependent on his parents.
Honestly, you're wrong.
They're talking about that, too.
Why worry about that?
I had beer last night.
Do you have any money for a cab?
These are the things I like.
No one can see it.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't like Mari.
You're convincing.
You're taking a bus to school?
John's a good friend.
Aren't you coming with me?
I can't hear a word.
Children are full of energy.
I prefer coffee.
They're young.
He's a DJ.
Tomi tried to sneak into the nightclub.
Good night, little lady.
I asked him if he was going to go there the next day.
I had to do it on my own.
Tom made me look stupid.
I ate fish yesterday.
The dog is your best friend.
Tom said she thought Mari was crazy.
You haven't convinced me yet.
He lived in Tom Boston when he was arrested.
I haven't done much lately.
I need more power.
No matter what I do, my parents will never be happy.
Tom ordered an extra big pizza.
His body hurt.
I pressed the wrong button.
I know Tom's late.
I think you're honest.
When he's in trouble, he always turns to his sister for help.
I didn't think Tom was going to Boston.
The wolves don't attack people normally.
Where's the next train going?
The accuracy of the measurement is important.
I don't understand why it's important.
Can you come get me at the station?
I really don't know where to start.
I didn't want you to see me cry.
They killed everyone.
Tom gets used to how things are here.
She's an actor.
My phone isn't working.
How do you think this happened?
Mari is one of Willendorph's veins.
I study hard at school.
I'd explain it to you, but your brain would explode.
I hope Tomi says yes.
Tom has a lot of good ideas.
If only I could be different!
Tom gave me his number.
Dan shot the man who tried to steal his car.
Tomi bought Mari a diamond ring.
He confessed to his mistakes.
You could have done it alone.
The boy got sick of anxiety.
They're drunk.
I wasted my money.
There are two windows in your room?
Tom's gonna shoot.
Be our guest.
Please answer me.
Tomi won't listen to this.
I remember Tom wearing a brown hat.
We're not friends.
Please close the door.
We don't have a dog.
It wasn't a very interesting novel.
Tom's been up all over the room.
How long were you waiting?
Do you like white chocolate?
The night sky is beautiful and touchingly magnificent.
I'm not crying.
Tom gave Mari a diamond bracelet for their wedding anniversary.
In the attic, my grandfather has his first-aid kit used in World War II.
Did Tom ever show you that letter?
They were fucking with each other.
What's on your mind?
Both of them are dead.
Everybody's changing.
Exactly, honey.
It's motivated by personal revenge.
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
It's always the same song.
I only have one brother.
I met him three years ago.
We fight a lot.
Explain to me why Tom isn't here.
We're not going to the beach.
There's hope.

That's what I need.
You like this tie?
Tom escaped from prison through a tunnel.
I kept something from you.
I don't want to deal with this anymore.
Don't worry about it.

Go slowly.

Why did you buy this bike?
It's cold at home.

My intention is to quit the company.

Thank you so much for everything.
How was your flight?

That question is easy to answer.
Why does Tom do that?

I'm afraid Tomi can't answer that.
A ship suddenly came out of the fog.
There are no rules.
Is there anything you want to know?
It's got its own value.

Tom has a ulcer.
Tom ran out to see what was happening.
Don't touch me!
Tom's my accountant.
Your cat scratched me.
I'm gonna pray for Tomi.
It wasn't easy for me.
He was quiet the whole time.
Watch out, don't fall.
He got drunk and bludgeoned.
It's a terrible plan.
I feel deeply about you.
That's what you need.
There's nothing special about it.
My mom washes clothes every day.
All I have to do is look at the food, and I get nauseous already.
Who are those guys?
I'm sure she'll come along with my grandmother.
We've got the Pope!
I was overweight.
Watch what he says.
We're investigating the case.
I'd like a vanilla ice cream.
Tomi's on ice.
I'm taking a bike to the office, except for the rainy days.
The cup of bodies under the bridge provided a terrible sight.
Tom was obviously dissatisfied.
The plane was covered with dust.
Tom wants Mari to be happy.
They called their son John.
Tomi wanted Mari to answer some questions about her past.
Have you ever been to the hair salon?
Do you think he'll do it?
It was fun.
You forgot the change.
Don't worry, things are going to be fine.
True friendship is rarer than diamond.
I know why Tomi was killed.
You're probably hungry.
A moment of coup could cost a pilot his life.
I have to go to my office.
How'd the audition go?
Let's not go back to that restaurant.
Do you have any love?
I saw your name on the list.
I love to speak Spanish.
You didn't have the right to do that.
It's too easy for him.
He didn't like my answer.
Tomi took a 20 out of her pocket.
Tom's advice is not very good.
You picked up some weight, didn't you?
Did Tom tell you how he did it?
I love that girl.
Mary accepted the gift.
The crop needs rain.
Tom, can I have this?
What do I tell Tomi?
English is taught in most countries.
Whatever he says, don't lose your head.
The conversation was secretly recorded and used as evidence.
Doctors don't know what's wrong with Tamás.
I don't know what Tom's doing in Australia.
Nothing was stolen.
It's busy preparing dinner.
It's not the right thing to do.
I was fishing at the Temza.
Born in a small village in the south of Turkey.
See below.
It seems that Europe is now the heaven.
Have you ever been drunk?
They're students.
Dad's very tired.
I couldn't stop crying.
Tom had a knife to Mary's throat.

That was our biggest problem.
You're very kind.
I'm deaf, too.
I'm so proud of my team.

I was wrong about that.
Buy, please.
We're gonna do this together.
Can you help me, please?

You can go home now.
It's just an empty threat.
