Emeli Kouki led Hurricane to his home victory in the opening - a second victory for Savo Volley
After seven consecutive times, Hurricane Loimaa, who held the Championship medals of the men’s volleyball, began the season 2018-19 with a home victory when Raision Loimu fell on Saturday from 3-0.
Emeli Kouki was 22 points the most effective Hurricane player from Romania to Finland.
There were some cheers abroad, but they didn't come true, and then there was a call from Loimaa.
We got a deal pretty fast, Kooki said.
Like Kouki, Tomi Rumpunen’s support for Kouki was 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was Samuli Kaislasalo 17 points out of a match-specific agreement.
It's always important to win the opening game.
Many players had experience on the other side, and it brought an extra extra extra to the game.
The game is not yet complete, but the continuation of the medal pipe is, of course, an objective, Kouki said.
Rohtänen Savo Volley's most effective
Miro Mättänen was 18 points the most effective in Savo Volley's time when the team poured out Next to Vantaa Ducks 3-0.
Our game was fluctuating, especially at the head of the attack, but fortunately, we won.
At least I had no knowledge of any different downloads when I was playing against my former team, Mättannen said.
Antti Siltala scored 12 points in the next volleyball 3 series during the 2000-01 season.
Chief Coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
Hall was a small, or atmosphere in the ceiling all the time.
The good guy was left with a home invasion.
Miro was a king, Pen too played a good game, Tuovinen said.
The previous season of Siltala in the league was 2006-07, then he won silver at Pieavesi Sammo, while in Tuovinen he was the head coach.
Thiago Maciel was Ducks' most effective 14 points.
Mikkonen again Star of Aka-Volley
In 2012-13, Joni Mikkonen, who won the league point exchange, has also started this period strongly.
Hakkuri scored 25 points when Aka-Volley took the season's opening victory after falling Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has started quite well on its own.
Today, of course, there was a defeat close to being the fourth round of losses on 17-21.
There was a fall out of some sort, and the fifth round came in at the same time, said Mikkonen.
A few years ago, the most effective of the tigers who were still in the final match was 28 points by the hacker Edvarts Buvivids.
Man of earth, Alexanders Kudrjashovs supported 17 points.
We didn't get much of a grip on the guy's tracker, Mikkonen said.
Finland in comparison with human capital world number one
Finland is at the top of the world in comparison with human capital, says Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years Finland was the one of the statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
In the past, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands placed one higher, and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016, the worst comparison was made between Niger and South Sudan.
Human capital is measured at the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population.
The World Bank has oriented human capital to economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico under control, the local game ended with no goal.
Real Madrid goaltender Thibaut Courtois took a stretch of anti-Glorification, and the local game of Madrid's teams ended up in a goalless game late Saturday in the Spanish football league.
Atletico from Madrid Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest to the goal, but the Belgian guard Courtois was able to fight.
Courtois played three games at Atletico while he was a loan-launderer.
In the early week, the International Football Union Fifa chose him as a goal keeper of the year.
In the real, Gareth Bale received the best goal, but his shot was directed past the end of the goal’s opening half.
After the break, Bale was in exchange for a passenger injury.
According to ESPN, the disillusioned Realists cried out the name of the paint gun that went to Juvent.
In the United States, there is now an attack on abortion law - a powerful documentary tells us why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to determine whether a candidate named by President Donald Trump could be elected as one of the nine Supreme Court members.
In the Republican Party, many would like to see Kavanaugh's decision, known as Roe v Wade, annulled by a decisive vote, which in the United States was legalized in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary film Reversing Roe - USA and abortion rights tell us how the current situation has been over the years.
As amazing as it seems, the topic is also topical in Finland.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (sin) has done public service work against safe abortion and has received various levels of support from the majority of representatives of our country.
At the beginning of the powerful document, Gynecologist Colleen McNicholas will meet, who has remained the only abortion doctor in Missouri, due to the blackmail of the law.
The clinic's armed guard says he's defending US religious freedom.
News videos remind me of the deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
Let's move on at a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the Lutheran Church Men’s Association directed women to reliable abortion doctors.
The reasons for the interviewed pastor are good, but in fact they are not even needed, a photograph of a woman who died of an abortion herself is enough.
There were about 5,000 deaths in the U.S. a year.
The legalization of abortions was defended in particular by the Republican Party.
Already in 1967, Governor Ronald Reagan signed an abortion law in California.
Later, Reagan, in his presidential election campaign in 1980, began to perversely mix religion with politics to bring the voters to the fore.
His abortion was also rounded up by his successor George Bush's parent.
And so did Donald Trump.
To the deepest heart of the matter, the document reaches out in search of a basis for the politicalisation of abortion.
When tax exemption was denied to religious organizations that favour racial separation, they became politically active.
An abortion was chosen as a stick horse.
Religion has brought exceptional knots into politics.
In writing this, the President has chosen Kavanaugh as the highest court candidate, who is now accused of sexual harassment by several women.
Kavanaugh can gain control over the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
The Israeli army shot seven Palestinians, including two children, at the border with large demonstrations
Almost 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months when Israel has been firing protestors in the border zone.
The Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza Strip on Friday, says the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, two children are among the dead: boys aged 12 and 14.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
Eighty-nine of these were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and struck the border zone when protestors threw Israel’s troops with stones and explosives.
The army says that they have started using force so that the protestors do not break down the border fence or attempt to cross it.
At least 191 Palestinians have died at Gaza protests since March, when Palestinians started weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the wounded are 12 000.
The protestors called for Palestinian families to have access to the areas from which the Palestinians had to leave when the state of Israel was established in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
Explosives from the Palestinian side have triggered forest areas and agricultural land in Israel.
Teemu Santa took a penalty shot. He couldn't shoot himself.
Wigan's top-of-the-mill Chey Dunkley seemed to have knocked him down by a coup in the penalty zone.
The referee, Gavin Ward, allowed the game to continue.
According to his interpretation, it was clean.
Teemu Santa couldn't believe his eyes.
I think the situation was a nuisance for Judge Ward, who sentenced Norwich to a penalty hit on the 85th minute Santa was brought down.
Ward showed a penalty point, and Mario Vrancic hit the 1-0 winning goal.
Santa has scored five goals for Norwich in the Championship.
The previous one was born in style against QPR last Saturday in the chest muscle.
The work was good for Puk again.
After losing the ball, he continued until the end of the situation.
He created paint situations, and he was untiringly defending himself.
To Norwich, the fight was the fifth in two weeks.
The team will continue in the league.
There's a five-win tube in the back.
The pedophile relief service was immediately filled with reservations - Finland has about 40,000 experiences in the interest of children
It is estimated that two per cent of men and a small proportion of women experience at least some sexual interest in pre-schools.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
Up to now, sexually interested children or young people have had a difficult time getting help.
The joint SeriE project of the Foundation for Criminal Care and Sexpo trains professionals to face pedophiles as clients and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, the e-mail fire and appointment times at the Sexpo offering advice and therapy began very quickly, says Yle.
However, these will be released in the autumn.
Sexual preference for children is a disgrace to many.
Most of the pedophilic emotions themselves have failed to carry out their fantasies and thus did nothing criminal.
However, preferences are usually a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that distress and depression them.
They also trouble normal life, says Yle, a sexual therapist, Patricia Thesleff, who acts as a specialist in the project.
In my opinion, the work is valuable if one child is saved from sexual violence, says Thesleff.
Chore leaders or Congolese gynecologist?
As the winner of the U.S. President Donald Trump Nobel Peace Prize, the idea may sound strange, but Trump is one of the most popular prize winners on the basis of betting factors.
Trump's role in getting North Korea, at least at the level of speech, is to commit to nuclear disarmament.
The biggest favorites for peace Nobel are, on the basis of the odds, South Korea President Moon Jae and North Korea Director Kim Jong, who have already met three times this year and have promised to seek a peace agreement between their countries.
Warming between the corees is significant, since the gap was still high last year.
Yet, for years to come, the reward of Kim, which leads with iron grips, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
Nobel Prize winners will be announced from Monday, and on Friday the most attention will be paid, i.e. the Peace Prize.
If the award is not given to those who have participated in the Korean Peninsula diplomacy, then one of the top candidates will be the Congolese doctor, Denise Mukwege.
A respected gynecologist in his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo has treated thousands of women who have been raped by mass rapes and has become the leading expert in the world.
Mukwege, at his work, has paid attention to sexual violence, which is a gruesome by-product of many conflicts.
A strong candidate has also been considered a UN refugee organisation that won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Committee has stated that this year, 331 candidates will be awarded the prize.
The names of the candidates are not disclosed to the public.
Trump himself wouldn't mind if Nobel had it.
In May, the reporter asked him if he thought he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it myself, Trump said it smiling.
I want to finish this.
The award I want is a victory for the whole world, and the President continued with reference to the North Korean negotiations.
However, there are things that make Trump's Nobel unlikely.
The Nobel Prize Committee of Norway has often given recognition to individuals and organisations representing liberal democracy and the multi-day world order - the very international cooperation which Trump has been seen to be against.
In the 21st century, three US politicians, all of whom were Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009.
So the reward for Trump would require an ideological translation from the Nobel Committee.
Fire alarm in the tunnel: Drivers behaved like a leper and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos in the Dragon happened on September 8th.
Due to the announcement, traffic in the Tunnel area was cut both towards Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that there was a system failure, the fire department tried to make transport normal.
However, it did not work very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Centre said it could not be opened, because there are drivers in the road with a shock and they drive how bad it happens, the firefighter Pasi Kroeäinen told the STT about his freshness at that time.
At that time, the motorway was left in the wrong direction, even after a moment of waiting.
When the first starts to act against the traffic rules, some others are often followed, Mr Tapio Heiskanen, contact Head of Transport Security, amazes me.
According to traffic rules, motorways and tunnels must not stop for any other reason than for forceful reasons.
Transport security reminds us that, in exceptional circumstances, it is not possible to go into danger of traffic by means of urgent solutions.
Alarm vehicles shall always allow as far as possible the smooth running possible.
Driving in the opposite direction on the freeway is particularly prohibited, as is making the u-turn and cancelling it.
The same prohibitions also apply in tunnels, where additionally, driving lights must always be switched on.
It is also prohibited to stop without compelling reasons, as is, of course, also parking.
In the past, there have even been cases where the driver has stopped in the tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this activity, says Heiskanen in the Road Safety Newsletter.
The Ilves fans would have liked to continue their celebration, even though the ship was caught on the bottom of the lake.
The Ilves fans carried by the Inland Watership M/S Tampere would have liked to stay on the ship to continue their victory party, although the ship had been caught in the bottom of the lake, says Juho Syrj, the ship’s chief of the event.
M/S Tampere, on a trip from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drifted out of its route late on Saturday night and was caught at the bottom of his bow in Vanajavesi in Aka.
Nineteen passengers on board the ship and five crew members were evacuated at night to the mainland.
No one got hurt in the pals.
The Ilves fans would have liked to continue their celebration on the ship until the morning, but of course it was more reasonable to send them home with a fire department ride to the port and by bus, Syrja said to the STT.
Ilves fans had been to Hämeenlinna to follow the fight between Ilves and HPK, which ended with the 4-3 victory of Ilves.
According to the discrimination, Saturday’s friend was due to the water’s surface in Vanajavee about six feet lower than normal.
According to Syrja, navigation was also made more difficult by the fact that the nearest sign was covered with locust waste and therefore its reflectors did not normally appear in the dark autumn bridge.
No further collision
The guy happened on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalmi shortly after the boat route had been below the Tampere-Helsingin motorway bridge.
The larger drama of the case was not related to the case, as the ship’s speed was very low at the time of the event and the impact on the ground did not cause a more significant impact.
According to the culprit, being caught in the bottom has not caused any leaks or prints on the ship, and the cruises of the ship continue normally.
The diver went to check the ship’s condition on Saturday morning before the ship was towed out of the lowlands.
To be sure, we're still at the shipyard to check that there's been no damage, Syrja says.
Syrja believes that the next cruise in M/S Tampere, scheduled for next weekend, can be completed in an agreed manner.
The cruise period of the ship continues, according to him, until the day of independence.
Do not use for ambulances
The rescue facility received an alarm on Saturday night shortly after 12 months.
The port of the Viola was called upon to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for the ambulances.
At night Matti Willman, the firefighter, told me that the conditions for evacuation on the lake were difficult because of the darkness and a pretty heavy wind.
After half three months, Pirkanmaa rescue station announced on Sunday night that all persons on board have been evacuated and passengers have been moved to Tampere by bus.
A cruiser built in 1957 has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump's judge's candidate for harassment and drinking may not be in the top office.
Brett Kavanaugh, the judge of the U.S. Supreme Court, may well miss out on the job he is seeking, estimated by the programme director Mika Aaltola of the Institute for Foreign Policy.
To date, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour during his studies.
According to Aaltola, suspicions have put so much political pressure on the Republican Party that President Donald Trump can end up putting another person into office.
In the United States, there has been a great deal of conflict in the past that the candidate for the President’s Supreme Court has been adjudicating.
In this case, the referee has usually withdrawn himself, says Aaltola.
This is how the President has been able to keep his face.
The name would rain in the Democratics' camp.
The U.S. Supreme Court seeks to be above politics, but at least in Kavanaugh's case, the election of a new judge has become a politically very sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision will, according to Aaltola, probably rain into the Democratic Party's Laar at the forthcoming congress elections.
It would increase the voting spirit of young people and women who would be more likely to vote on Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge in the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
There is no opportunity for every presidential term, as judges of the Supreme Court will be appointed for life in the United States.
In practice, some of them have retired from their own request at the age of about 70-80.
Some Republicans, too, doubted the term
The U.S. Supreme Court judges will normally be examined in the background, says Aaltola.
Although Trump has only set a one-week deadline for the FBI's supplementary report, it can still, according to Aaltola, bring out something essential.
I think it might.
It's rare to have smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, at least it is certain that Kavanaugh's suitability or suitability for office will be debated in a lively manner before the Senate makes its decision.
In the Senate, the Republicans have a majority of 51-49 votes, but at least two women's Republican senators believe that Kavanaugh's appointment is suspicious.
The most embarrassing thing would be that the name would be put to the vote and the Republicans would lose.
A woman identified Salisbury as a suspect military intelligence agent.
The Russian woman has informed the BBC of the identification of Salisbury as a Russian military intelligence agent for the poisonings.
Based on the photographs, she reported that it was military intelligence at the GRU, Anatoli Chepiga.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia previously reported that they exposed one of the suspected men in Chepiga.
They said earlier that they found evidence that men’s existing identities are covert.
The BBC Group traveled to the Far East near the Russian-China border to the village where Chepiga grew.
The woman in the village identified a young Chepigan as being published by Bellingcat.
He identified the same man from the British police photos of a man calling himself Ruslan Boschiroks today.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter on the Novithok nerve poison in March.
Scripples survived.
Colonel Chepiga has been awarded, among other things, the honor mark of the Russian hero in 2014.
Russia still denies the suspected GRU connection.
Previously, in September, the men suspected of poisoning told the Russian TV interview that they were tourists in Salisbury.
Old people throwing bags in social reform
There is now a lively example of what the Sipilä Government has defined in practice as a restriction on the change in the reform of the war.
The Sote services of my municipality of birth are produced by the Oulunkaari Municipality, which has been elected Regional Director of Attendo in 2016.
The heads of the municipal association shall warn the delegation of the change limiter.
If the military expenditure goes up now, the municipal state aid will be cut in the future.
The central decision-makers of the municipality were startled, and most of them are prepared for the major restructuring of the care of the elderly, which would put an end to institutional care in the health centre’s bedside district and a small unit of memory patients.
Home care would be increased, which means long distances in Vala means that elderly people living in remote villages are torn from their roots next to the health centre for "home" treatment.
Attendo trusted the municipality to pay its customers.
The left-wing elections did not absorb poor preparation, but organised a good public event with many family, close-up nurses, as well as other parties' representatives.
I presented my presentation on how the municipality of Vala is already taking care of the elderly at home most in the whole of Northern Ostrobothnia.
There was also Carina Läninen, Commissioner for the neighbourhood.
The local newspaper made a big case about the opportunity, and it brought the Oulunkars to their hind legs.
Sote manufacturers do not write on any of the papers that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Valaa, which is now waiting for empty residents.
There are no other service providers.
The rapporteurs only speak of a service note, but do not tell what level of care it can provide or what type of staff structure Attendo will take care of the elderly until they are treated.
Without a nurse?
The health centre’s facilities are stopped because there is no doctor’s night care.
Attendo will also rely on the doctors of the Vaala Health Centre.
An example of the election is how Central officials run the authorised ones with incomplete information and the delegates are pushed against the wall with a change limiter.
This is how the Central Party emptys the residents of Vala, for who will remain safe there to live voluntarily if there is a chance of moving out.
Was it one election in the centre that the whole country is kept inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan opened a big-shoe in Cologne.
In Germany, thousands of people in the city of Cologne expressed their minds when the visiting Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened the largest mosque in Europe.
Several hundred people had gathered on the Rhine River from the morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read on the signs of protesters, and the slogans condemned fascism.
During the visit to Erdogan on Thursday, several demonstrations have been organised and security measures have been strict.
In Cologne, about 10,000 people were expected to protest, among other things, the human rights situation in Turkey.
The supporters of Erdogan had also gathered near the major mosque.
However, the police had isolated a large area from the mosque for safety reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised the success of his visit to Germany and estimated that it had strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel swore on Friday that they would rebuild relations between countries that had deteriorated significantly since the Turkish coup d'état of 2016.
However, Merkel stressed that there were profound differences between countries, including on human rights issues.
Review is surrounded by a visit
Both Henriette Reker, Mayor of Cologne and Armin Laschet, Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, withdrew their participation in the opening ceremony as the criticism of Erdogan's visit accelerated.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, reported having come to a protest against Erdogan from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who can't go down the streets in Turkey.
They've been arrested, killed and subjected.
For Erdogan, anything that is different from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the last stage of Erdogan's German journey in North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant proportion of the population is of Turkish origin.
In Slovakia, three charges for the murder of the journalist
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
On Friday, the D.A. told me that three people are charged with the February murder of Kuciak and his fiancée and other crimes.
Earlier this week, the police arrested eight people in the murder investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot in February with his fiancée in his home in Bratislava.
He had studied relations between politicians and the Italian Mafia.
The police have suspected that the murders were connected to Kuciak's reports.
The case and the article published by Kuciak have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems with the distribution of the herd on Sunday in the dispersal areas
Because of the failure of the print, also the Karjalainen on Sunday will have to be mailed without an address.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the magazine in dispersal areas where distribution to collective boxes is required to be carried out from external memory.
The situation was the same with regard to the Saturday newspaper, and the problem may continue on Monday.
Posting puts extra leaf tricks in the county.
Leaves of other Finnish subscribers are posted separately only on Monday.
The distribution of these magazines is considerably delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Today, editor Arto Nyberg interviews directly in his forthcoming discussion programme, including Vesa Heilala.
Vesa is in the studio telling about her coming space trip, which she booked from Virgin Galactica already in 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000, which was paid in the form of a bank loan.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the date of departure has been postponed for one year.
It now seems that after an unlucky trial flight, which took place in 2014, and even a death victim, things are going to be fine.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will start again this year or at the latest next year.
Vesa’s flight number is 300, which is about one year from the first departure.
The flight lasts 2.5 hours and is in an unweight state for 5 minutes at 100 kilometres, and the Finnish astronaut tells of the future on his homepage.
At the same address, he's also backgroundizing his yearning for space.
When I was a kid, I read a comic book called Space Travel, and I saw the Star Trek series on TV.
The Star Wars have been seen, and that's where the idea of it is.
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a rude host
Manchester City continued its lossless course in Valioliiga when it poured out its home field, Brighton painting, 2-0 on Saturday.
The sixth victory of the reigning team is guaranteed by the goal syringes Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was able to steer the fourth of the season from close to the empty finish when Leroy Sané found him at 30 minutes from the back of Brighton's goal.
The Agüero raised his own goal balance to five when he and Sterling sawed the Brighton defense pieces with 65th game minutes.
The Argentinan was able to place the two-0 endings at the spot of punishment easily.
The City who started the season with six wins and one tie leads Valioliiga with 19 points.
One less game played in Liverpool, however, is stalking only one point away.
Liverpool will meet on Saturday night in her seventh round match with the three-in-three Chelsea.
New decision-makers were selected by youth clubs in Joensuu
At its meeting on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Society chose new decision-makers for its next three-year period 2019-2021.
The president was Mr Anu Sivonen from Ylä-Savo and the vice-president was Mr Petra Mäkeläinen from Häme.
40 members and 40 alternate members of the Board of Governors were elected, the Finnish Youth Societys will be informed on Sunday.
The youth club was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural activities to be known for their quality and safety.
The Youth Society Conference in Joensuu gives three promises in its three-year operating goals: We keep the doors open for all, and we organise equal leisure activities regardless of the place of residence and background, and we support voluntary activities and people on their own growth paths, the Finnish Youth Society reports in its press release.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkö and amazed Ferrari: "To get away with a very important driver"
The Swiss newspaper, Blick, asked Mersu’s Brittany if he believed that the release of Kimi Räikkös from Ferrari’s services would help Hamilton in the end.
Hamilton runs the second driver of Ferrari at the World Cup, Sebastian Vettel with 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari told me that Räikkönen would not continue in the stable next season, while Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Of course, Hamilton doesn't believe that Räikkönen would put gloves in the sink.
I don't think Kimi will change in the remaining races.
He's an exceptional professional... a fantastic driver.
He stays one of my favorites, and I'm convinced Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Hamilton has told me before that Räikkönen has been one of his photographs.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and I was dreaming of the first formula, I played the F1 game at PlayStation all day.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season continues on Sunday at the Russian competition.
The race starts at 2 p.m. at the fireplace in Mercedes, Valteri Bottas.
The evening paper follows the moment of the race.
The A-Youth Championship of the football SM series became a full farce: the opponent arrived only with 7 players
The top level of football boys ends on Saturday, when the final round of the season will be played.
Before the 13th round, the starting points were clear from the point of view of the championship campaign: FC Lahti to the Academy is practically enough for the first step against the Vasa IFK.
In order for the situation to turn over in the last round, the second Ilves in the championship battle has to win the PK-35 and hope for the Lahtis to lose.
However, the Lahtien Championship was practically confirmed even before the opening week, since the Left IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one less of them, the fight could not have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
In the break, the Gulfers led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the downfall is that the team has partially played the A-youth SM series, i.e. the P20 series and the C-section for men.
The Left IFK has played in the Second in practice against the fall of the whole season.
In the second round on Saturday, Vasa IFK will be forced to win the JBK in the game and hope that Tampere United will lose its own match against Siilinjärvi in Toivala.
The car ended up on the roof of Eno. According to the rescue unit, good luck was involved.
The passenger car got out of the way and ended up on the roof of Eno in Juttuvaranten on Sunday at 9:00 p.m.
There were four people involved in the accident.
Two of them were slightly injured, and the rescue unit is reporting.
Good luck was there, the press reports.
According to the rescue department, the road was wet after the rain.
The police patrol came to the scene of the accident.
Supo is waiting for new ways of intelligence: Equipment acquisitions and recruitments already carried out, foreign planning activities will not be sneezed
According to Supo’s chief Antti Pelttar, intelligence has been prepared to purchase equipment and train staff.
When the intelligence laws enter into force, a permanent increase of around EUR 10 million would be needed.
The premises of the Finnish Defence Police (Supo) in the Ratakadu Helsinki already have a full head to prepare for the entry into force of intelligence.
Antti Pelttari, the Co-Chair of Supo, tells the West Media that equipment purchases have already been made for future intelligence missions.
Serena Williams upsets me with a video of her singing in the topless, campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer.
The tennis superstar, Serena Williams, turns on again.
Now he campaigned to raise awareness of breast cancer by publishing a video on his Instagram account where he sings only his hands in front of his breasts, says AFP.
The paragraph is the 1991 Hit I Touch Myself of The Divinyls, Australia.
On the video, Williams supports the activities of the Australian breast cancer association.
"My mother's worldwide hit by The Divinyls to remind women to do their own [breasts] checks regularly", Williams writes in his Instagram message.
And yes, this put me in an uncomfortable area, but I wanted to do it, because the subject touches all women regardless of the color of the skin around the world.
Early detection is all a and o - it saves many lives.
The second writer of The Divinyls' song is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago when he was 53 years old.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project made in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
"He died of breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first," Williams says.
The video has now been watched 1.5 million times.
It was published early on Sunday morning.
The video comments praise Williams for his courage.
Williams dropped out of the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
The background is the U.S. open tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams came to the main court of the fight and, among other things, claimed that men were allowed to use much harder than women's players.
Chinese restaurant on mountain trail is not suitable for the tallest
In addition to traditional Chinese treats, the restaurant serves wonderful landscapes.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in the province of Zhejiang, China.
It is literally located on the cliff’s tongue.
If you want to look down there, you can look at the forest.
Stupendous landscapes at the heights make restaurant visitors cry out their lives in the Longquan Mountains.
Access to the restaurant requires a walk in the middle of the peach trees.
The restaurant opened for visitors on 19.9.2018.
Youtube comments wonder where the restaurant's bathroom is located.
Traveling to a restaurant requires good groundwork, the place is informed.
Korpela's alley run ends today: This is how it all ends.
Everything good will end in time.
Today, that’s what happens to the domestic country drama, the Korpela alley race, which has been quite held.
The third production period has gone like hot stones: last week, 722,000 Finns watched the episode as their first performance on television.
The top figures in themselves are no longer of any practical significance, as the series of Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkinen is not going to continue.
In the final phase, the relationship between the Pacific and the Mirku takes the forward step again, and I think that the Estonian mother is the first to guess what should be done.
The relationship between Anssi and Miisa is warm, and, in the light of recent events, it is very romantic, but then again Laiho appears in the patterns.
Even the police have doubts about this man.
Still, no one will know the fate of Laho in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, is gonna get some incredible news.
The last will of a distance will be revealed, which brings a woman to the brink of tears.
A week later, Sunday nights, the latest episode of Sorjonen will continue.
Korpela's alley race today on TV 1 at 21.05.
Do you think tomorrow you should go to work on a little flu?
Here are the facts for and against
The Flu season is hot.
A lot of scars stay home or not.
However, it is worth considering whether others should be infected, since the disease may be contagious even if its own symptoms are minor.
Sometimes the symptoms of flu occur suddenly, sometimes they appear in the mice.
In the latter option, you may infect others, even if your symptoms seem small, says Prevention.
So you think it's worth staying home?
Prevention indicates that the flu is contagious even when the person has no symptoms.
The virus will take it a day before the symptoms begin and from five days to a week.
Children may infect the disease longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you shouldn't be at school or at work.
You can go back to work when you cough up and there's no fever anymore, says medical professor Gregory Poland.
It is also worth avoiding training.
Too fast to return to the gym slows the recovery.
And don't forget to wash your hands, put them on your handkerchief and throw them in the trash.
You're sick, though?
If you have to leave your home sick, consider using a protective mask.
The mask doesn't control the viruses, but it keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then you don't put your fingers in your nose or mouth, says Poland.
The sneeze is also limited to the mask.
Then how can we avoid infection?
The best way is still to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, it is difficult to avoid the latter.
For example, the average person in the United States touches his eyes, nose or mouth every 15-30 seconds, and Poland warns.
The new Miss Finland repeats the Miss tradition: "My husband is a hockey player"
The hockey player and misses are often linked together.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkova at 23.
Alina Voronkova, from Pertunmaa, has received Miss Suomen kroon for her deafs.
The beauty girl now lives in Lahti, where she moved to when she was 15.
Alina's mother is an Inkerin Finnish and father is a Russian.
My father's Russian, Voronkova, was bullied at school.
Mom and Dad have moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied because of my Russianism.
On Pertunmaa I had no friends at all, and Alina tells me about the release of Miss Finland competition semifinalists.
After high school, Alina decided to start off from a clean table and move to the Gulf to go to high school.
Soon, the missiunotar found new friends, and the ark went rolling as it were.
When he was 15, he thinks he's an adult, but when I think about it, I really wasn't.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Jonah Hurrin, who is familiar with Pelicans' ranks.
Since the SM League career, hockey player has played abroad, such as in Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was on the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Cup.
In the early days of dating, the couple lived in a distance of almost a year, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get to the winner's three, and that would lead me to a career, I don't want to believe it would have any effect on our relationship.
Even if we were to live apart, we have a good trust and the good thing about distance is that it stays on top of the whole time, and Alina was agitating in May.
With joy from continued growth, death on our side
Almost everyone is concerned about the earth’s endurance.
But it's just that they don't want to give up.
Sustainable alternatives to continued growth are being sought, but even the theory of a fair economy runs into major problems.
Over a few generations, the constant economic growth has brought ordinary people, especially in the northern hemisphere, a standard of living that could only be dreamed of before.
However, the long-lasting overcapacity of the earth and climate change will cause this stone foot of a market economy to deteriorate dramatically.
Two men were stabbed on Sunday night in Cannelmäe, Sitrator, at four o’clock in the morning.
The man born in 1986 was seriously injured by the stab and the other one, born in 1968, less easily.
The older men are already out of the hospital.
The police have captured one person whose possible contribution to the stabilization will be investigated.
The police are also looking for another suspect in connection with the events.
Events are being investigated as attempted and gross assault.

Important paint and a valuable point, summed up Mariahamina’s head coach Peter Lundberg.

We made a lot of mistakes during the opening period, but luckily, the Turkish paint brought us into the game stronger.
Home team John Allen, Chief Coach of Inter, said that the game was under control, but the goaling again brought pain.
One mistake in our defenses took a total point point, Allen was sorry.
Once again, we were the best!

We got Niger on the tail.
It was the first time STT told me about it.
The pager showed his underpower skills, the place of play is not yet sure.
Jori Lehterä's strong underpower game arose when his NHL club, Philadelphia Flyers, played his last training game before the beginning of the season.
Philadelphia won Boston 4-1, and Lehtera fed Michael Raffle twice to the goal.
In the last few days, Lehter's been on display for drug suspicions.
On Wednesday, MTV told us that Lehterä is one of 23 suspects in a drug belt, where some are suspected of drug use and knows, for example, sales.
The newspaper has denied that he committed a crime.
The club and player have discussed the issue, and NHL will investigate the case.
After the match, Sam Carchidi, the next Philadelphia Inquirer journalist, closely estimates that the Lehter belongs to a group of six attackers, five of whom will be placed on the NHL team.
In the training game Lehter said Carchid was excellent.
In the second round Lehtera fought the puck underpower, pulled the defender against him, and fed Raffli to the open space before the finish.
The second time the double cooperation brought the goal right at the end of the match.
Flyers will start the NHL season on October 4th at a guest match against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defenseman Urho Vacane is waiting for the team's coaching board to decide if he can join the NHL team.
I thought the practice camp was good.
I did my best, and I can be proud of it.
Now the coach will decide if I can play.
I think I'm ready for the NHL, the white man said in an interview with Boston's Twitter account.

New image shows change: The strongest man in the world lost tens of pounds
In 2017, Eddie Hall, crowned the world's strongest man, is undergoing striking transformation.
The British Eddie Hall hunted the title of the strongest man in the world long and determined.
Hall could eat up to 10 000 kilocalors per day and, according to Mirror magazine, weighs up to 200 kilos per day.
The shirts were 5XL.
Before winning the title, Hall admitted to doing damage to his body.
The human body has not been created to be this size, Hall said.
The British hunted down the strongest man race in the world by all means, and the family man promised to end his career if the title was given.
Hall didn't want her kids growing up without her dad.
Hall kept his promise, and he was no longer seen at April 2018’s strongest male competitions in the world.
In Instagram, Hall recently published a picture where he poses his active career in a more vulnerable condition.
Hall writes its current weight is 169,5 kilos.
Hall wrote that he is training five aerobically a week today.
Among other things, the programme includes boxing, cycling and swimming.

The restaurant ship M/S Tampere rushed to the carnage in Pyhäjärvi - "Struantly caught with a rock"
The Inland Watership M/S Tampere sailed on a late Friday night in Akaa Pyhäjärvi.
The rescue facility received an alarm about a water traffic accident on Friday night after 12 noon.
The 30-metre ship M/S Tampere has fallen on the run and is firmly attached to its front with a rock, described by the firefighter Matti Willman.
The ship carried 19 passengers and five crew members.
According to the rescue department, personal injuries were avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland from the ship.
Now they're being transferred by bus to Tampere, the chief of staff, Jari Nieminen, told the STT at 1:00 p.m.
The port of the Viola was called upon to receive evacuated passengers.
The ship travelling from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had for some reason drifted off its route west of the narrow Jumusensalmi.
The police will find out what happened.
The firefighter Matti Willman told me earlier this evening that the conditions on the lake are difficult because of the darkness and the wind.
According to the rescue department, the ship's fate is unclear.
Looks like the ship's not leaking.
After the evacuation operation, the divers begin to check what's at the bottom.
The M/S Tampere, built in 1957, is now a restaurant vessel with a maximum authorised passenger capacity of 180 persons.
There is also a meeting room for private use on board the ship.
According to the ship’s websites, the cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-Managers demand unpaid fees from Robert Helenius
The boxer Robert Helenius's night fight against Erkan Teper is a shadow of the money dispute.
In the evening, the boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and Deputy Judge Jussi Kokkkila announced today a challenge application, which will charge Helenius with a total of over EUR 80,000 for unpaid manager fees.
According to the application, Helminen and Kokkkila worked for Helenius on 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We've been trying to make amends, but there's no other way.
There has been a clear mandate here, and there has been a great deal of work, and Kokkkila says to Ilta-Sanom.
Markus Sundman, the current manager of Helenius, sent a reply to the evening newspaper, explaining the events of the boxer’s view.
Helenius denies that he is obliged to pay the required amount.
According to their response, Kokkkila and Helminen had provided their services in a difficult economic situation for Helenius and promised to be able to organise matches and sponsorships for him.
It had been agreed that Helenius was obliged to pay the prizes only as a percentage of his matches.
It was repeatedly assured that Helenius did not have to pay anything, simply to receive their income.
This is also normal and only practice for professional athletes.
Wage work has never been agreed and would have been absurd in the situation of Helenius, Sundman explains in his message.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to Helenius, from the beginning he would have liked to agree on the distribution of income in writing, but Kokkkila and Sundman did not receive the draft until the end of 2014.
He considered the proposal to be poor on his own and cut off cooperation with Kokkkila and Helmis.
Helenius did not fight once when dealing with Kokkkila and Helmis.
A year after the end of the cooperation, Helenius had been assigned a "inexhaustible but extensive" bill of manager's work.
This year, the same claims have been made.
Helenius considers Helminen and Kokkkila’s ex-post activities to be cowardly, the response states.
Helenius is meeting today in the seventh Erkan Teperin Stuttgart, the seventh list of IBF’s heavy series.
A Hearty Man and a Good Journalist
The entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio drinker and journalist Erkki Pälli for decades.
At 83 years of age, Erkki Pälli died of unhealed liver cancer.
The master's death report was published in the Helsingin Sanoma on Sunday.
The report says that Päll died on September 3rd.
Pälli reported a serious illness on her Facebook website in March 2018.
The publication was also seen by Ile Vainio, who was grieved by the knowledge of the familiar fate.
He left a goodbye on Facebook earlier, as Ile Vainio says.
The Legion considers Erkki Päll to be a giftable expert who has become a brilliant journalist.
He reminds me that Päll was a man with quick hoxnots and funny things.
I learned to know Erk when I was a little boy when I was 12 years old, and I started there as a warehouseman.
That's when Erk and I met each other.
He was then an informant on the Finnboard and in various tasks, Ile Vainio recalls.
As I went on to make records as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was a regular editor at all the parties to do stories about artists.
He was always expert, and I saw how big a fire he had for entertainment, music, and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got right to the skin of his interviewers.
He was a hearty man and a good reporter.
To many, he became known as the highly respected Radio Joker of the High, but he also wrote brilliant newspaper stories.
Erkki interviewed me several times.
He was good at talking. He's very good at talking.
Over the decades, Pälli worked not only with the reporter’s work but also with the Fazer label Toivo Kärje.
He worked as a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir's albums.
However, the main passion of the head was radio work, with a unique style.
He's been doing radio work since the 1960s, and he's become familiar to numerous audiences in Ylen's ether.
She retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Federation announced on Saturday that the financial year ended in May showed approximately EUR 450 000 in profits.
The alliance describes the 'full translation' experienced in its economic situation, although the economy is, of course, under pressure from 'the significant debt in balance'.
Managing Director Mika Kulmala commends rapid response and tight economic discipline.
Last autumn, we reacted as quickly as possible by taking adjustment measures.
Careful planning and economic management of the activities has struck through our entire organization, Kulmala explains in the newsletter.
We have also succeeded well in partner procurement, and in addition, the world cup yield was maximum in the past competitive period.
However, in the future, cost management must also be precise and, at the same time, we must constantly look for new financing models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
Tens of bodies lying in the back yard of the hospital, please, in the city of Indonesia, on the island of Sulawes.
Only one building separates them from the area for the assessment of the need for injury and treatment of injured survivors.
Patients are also treated outside due to post-surgical events.
One of the people who moved in the hospital area was a 52-year-old man named Bahuridd, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
Last time I spoke to him when he was going to school, Bahurddin told the AFP news office.
In the yard area of the Army Hospital in Palu lay Dwi Haris, who has suffered injuries to his back and arm.
He was at a local hotel with his wife and daughter at the start of the quake.
The family had been invited to Palu's wedding party.
I was probably hit by a cracking wall.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my kid.
I hope they're safe, Haris told AP the news agency according to British media.
Small stores are being robbed.
I'm asking you at the evacuation center for a 35-year-old baby's mother, Risa Kusuma, tried to calm down her hot baby.
He described the atmospheres of the city as tight.
There's very little clean water.
Small stores are being robbed everywhere, said Kusuma.
Many of the residents of Please have slept outside or in temporary Bamboos.
Even if the home is somehow standing, any extremism could destroy it once and bury the inhabitants.
According to the News Office AP, more than half of the prisoners in prison escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
There were reportedly about 560 prisoners, so there may be about 300 fugitives.
A part of Donggala prison prisoners has also escaped, says The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, prisoners became angry and set the prison on fire after the guards had told them not to go looking for relatives suffering from earthquakes and tsunamis.
The airport has been reopened mainly for aid flights.
Amongst the first, an army transporter, C-130, landed on the ground, bringing relief supplies.
Commercial flights Please permit only a limited number of flights to the airport.
The pilots are forced to land in the field without the help of the air traffic control, as the air traffic control tower was badly damaged in an earthquake.
Rain wipes over Finland at night
The whole country is spread across a long area of rain from the west on Sunday night, reports the Department of Aviation Sciences.
The rain comes mostly as water, but in the central and northern child, it is expected to be blush or snow.
Last night’s glazes are not repeated, as under the cloud cover the temperatures remain higher.
The cloudier night keeps the lowest temperatures rather effectively controlled.
Right in the west, you can go to the cold side, said an on-call meteorologist, Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rain zone will be heading eastward in the morning.
In the south and west, there are vermin or half clouds.
In the afternoon, temperatures are always moving up to Oulu at steps of 10-13 degrees.
The start of the week looks similar in terms of temperature in the southern and central parts of the country, but the weather is becoming more unstable.
There are wind and wave warnings in maritime areas.
No real autumn storms are expected for the next few days, but otherwise there will be varying weather for the typical autumn.
It's the fall that starts to stab seriously, Ilkka said.
Miss Suomi final is not on TV
From IL-TV, you will be able to follow the red carpet glamour and rope of the Miss Finland competition.
The entertainment editors of the evening magazine are pulling live on IL-TV from the red carpet of the Miss Finland final from Billnäs’s pot.
The transmission starts at approximately 18.50.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned with ten finalists on Saturday.
The Miss Finland 2018 final will be held at the Billnäs Ruuku in Raasepor.
Before the finals start, you will be able to track the atmosphere from the top of the spot on the IL-TV live broadcast.
Live broadcast starts at about 6:30 and continues for about an hour.
This year, especially many winners of the previous year's Miss Finland have been invited to the finals.
They are represented in the Judiciary in 1998 by Miss Jonna Ziprus.
Other representatives of the jury include the welfare entrepreneur Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammoud, CEO of the Joun Business Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen and the news producer Katja Lintunen.
We were hoping he'd go to college before we went to the Mass.
The Russian Dimitri's father and the Inquiry's mother, Svetlana, believed her daughter's success in the Miss Finland final.
Fresh Miss Alina Voronkova’s parents, Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova, were proud to follow their daughter’s first - time crown.
They sat in the audience from Pertunmaa and were going to drive back home after the finals.
It's a wonderful atmosphere!
We believed in Erika all along, but half an hour before the outcome, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is an Inker and Dimitri is a Russian.
Alina speaks a smooth Russian, even though she has lived throughout her childhood in Finland.
Svetlana says that when she was little, Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than Miss's career.
Alina was often told that when she was so pretty, she should be Miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio runner.
Only later did Alina get excited about the beauty contests.
The parents hoped that Alina would go to the university before participating in the Miss Finland competition.
This was the case, and in the end, Alina wanted to make her position before the Missions.
We asked him why he didn't participate last year, but he wanted to finish that line.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because there is a healthy example for young people and adults.
He has a lot of sports and a healthy meal.
And Alina likes to be on display, I can see it.
Alina's boyfriend, Joonas Hurri, is playing hockey in Japan, and he could not encourage love in the final.
Alina's parents believe that the relationship between young people lasts for a missive year.
Yes, that's the point!
The parents were hoping that the daughter would be there soon.
Now it's been such a long break in the visits because of the missors.
I miss you, even though you've been texting me.
A young man was killed in an overrun in Lahti. The police captured three people.
According to the police, three people have been arrested as a result of the incident.
On Saturday, the D.A.P.D. did not comment on the progress of events and the possible over-drivingness of the investigation due to the incompleteness of the investigation.
Nor did the police comment on whether the persons caught and the man who died over the course of the run knew each other from their past.
Further information on this case will be available at the earliest at the beginning of next week.
Sari Pipppo left his career in Brussels and became a home mother in Finland - thought of the idea of a cartoon: a lack of drawing skills did not slow down
At one time, the animal bomb left from my husband's blow, where he proposed it as a person to the story I developed, says the comic book blogger, the home mother and former EU translator Sari Pippo.
Sari Piippo reports that he was the EU translator responsible for economic and legal affairs in Brussels until after the fourth child, the family returned ten years ago.
I've been very comfortable as a housewife.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it occurred to me that what it would do when the youngest child started to be big.
Then 2014 came a cartoon.
The drop says that he had never dreamed of making a cartoon, even though he had read Aku Ankka, Tint, and Asterix since he was little.
The last time I had drawn a child, but when these manuscripts began to be born, the situation changed.
At first I made a few dozen manuscripts in the desk box.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a good artist, but I couldn't attract her until summer 2016, when I donated Viivi with the help of the drawing board.
His enthusiasm lasted for a dozen stripes, and then he had to start trying to laugh at Pippo, which tells him that the drawing plate was a great encouragement.
The drawing board is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something done.
I didn’t even try to draw the paper, Pippu tells me about his relationship with drawing, which he usually does at night.
The manuscripts are constantly popping into my mind, but I usually don't prepare at the same time.
One of the three-square stripes takes up to several hours.
I might make a screen at a time, and I'd love to play with the colors.
Starting a drawing is always the hardest because drawing is not the strongest of my kind.
Sari Piippo says that he appreciates the modern - day series of newspapers, including Scott Adams, Dilbert.
The people of the animal bomb are the mother of the carrot skin, who has a salad softness on the L theme.
The other people are Man, Piss and Twins.
In the world of nature, man is what he eats.
A series of ideas come from your own life and social media.
Sari Pippo doesn't want to preach or offer a coercion ball, even though there's a bit of a thing going on in there sometimes.
The beep tells us that he reads his series with his husband and children.
I mean, it's such a great feeling when you look at the cartoon you're drawing and you realize that this is what I've done today.
And there are plenty of challenges for your mother!

The Indonesian earthquake: The air traffic controller sacrificed himself - did not leave a cracking tower until hundreds of passengers were secured.
Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21-year-old flight leader, has become a hero of the Indonesian earthquake.
Agung was left alone in the air traffic control tower until he was safely escorted to the passenger plane carrying hundreds of people from an island shaken by the earthquake.
The young man was in charge of the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in the city of Please, when the earthquake struck on Friday.
As the others fled the air traffic control tower, Agung refused to leave its place before being able to steer Batik Air from the runway to the air.
In this way he could save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian aviation administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport Saturday after the earthquake.
The flight control tower was shaking and cracking.
Eventually, Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg broke and he had severe internal organ injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was to be transported to a better equipped facility with helicopters, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, and the Air Administration representative told The Jakarta Post.
The quake continued to increase when the flight got into the air, and its intensity was finally measured at 7.5 magnets.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian Aviation Administration has respected the heroism of Agung in social media.
Rehn thought about the end of Europe in the trade war: "We need to look at the next twitter"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy.
Growth forecasts have been calculated across Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly reduced its own economic growth estimates.
Director-General Olli Rehn said in the first column that, although the tightening tension has no direct impact on European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which in turn reflects the investment decisions of companies.
The situation also applies to the export of Finnish companies.
In Rehn's view, Europe is so far a bakery.
It has been able to build an intermediate peace with the United States and has also helped to calm the situation with China and Japan.
In Rehn's view, Europe does not seem to be milling into the feet of a trade war.
We need to look at the next twist and then evaluate it.
We have a pretty unpredictable partner on the way to Washington, but he said in an interview with Ylen.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of these is Italy's third largest national economy in the euro area, which is also one of the most debt countries in the euro area and in the Western world.
The market reacted sharply yesterday Thursday evening by the Italian Government to clearly present the deficit budget.
Next year's deficit is more than 2.4 per cent of the population's output.
Mr Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
Of the country's lending stock, 5% are problem loans and more than 10% are irregular credits.
In addition, its public finances are weak and the country seems to be once again exceeding its commitment to its European partners.
Perhaps it is not worth painting new crises, and Rehn replied when he was asked whether Italy would take Europe to a new economic crisis.
The second thing about Europe is the British distinction from the EU.
Rehn hoped it would be fine.
The controversial separation would have much more negative effects.
Rehn began as Director General of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB) will withdraw from his duties in just a year's time.
The conversation with his successor has begun.
Both Rehn and his predecessor, Erkki Liikasen, have been waning in speeches.
I'm sure it's okay if Finnish names are involved, Rehn said and added that he's not going to comment further on this.
HS super-popular Black Box presentations will continue next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are for sale
The popular Black Box presentations organised by the Helsingin Sanomas will continue again in the week.
Other presentations will take place at the National Theatre on October 2, 8 and 11.
On October 23, the Black Box will visit the Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets to the National Theatre for sale.
Tampere performance is complete.
Tickets are sold at Lippu.fi.
Throughout the evening, journalists and photographers on the stage will tell a fact which they have long prepared and which has not previously been published in any HS instrument.
There's something else that nobody's ever heard.
"There is a strange spy in Helsinki at night, an impressive report from the other side of the world, and a talking story about a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the presentation, the public will have the opportunity to meet HS journalists and photographers and continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has organized the evenings of living journalism for three years.
They have been popular from the start and often sold out.
More than 15,000 people have already been to the audience.
The Black Box was awarded in the Bonnieer Gala as a year's journalistic act.
The awarders thanked them for a new way of doing journalism and for the desire of journalists to come close to their readers.
Spring 2019 Black box will be seen at the National Theatre in March-April.
The presentation will also visit Tampere and Turku.
The performance at that time has a different content than this autumn night.
A missing fungus was found by a "precious experiment"
Finnish police drone expertise is the top of the world: "We are being asked for training"
According to the head of the College of Police, the police can use drones in addition to missing persons, for example, crime scene investigation and intelligence.
On Tuesday, the Oulu police managed to find the drone that disappeared in Raahe only in a few minutes.
Head of Police College Kimmo Himberg referred to the case and noted, among other things, that "with unprejudiced experimentation and effective training, we are also the world's leading in this too".
Drone's a whole new thing, and he's a whole newer cop thing.
There is no statistics that the Finnish police are the master of the use of drones.
According to Himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case.
For example, this has occurred when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported in international events.
There's a lot of interest in it somewhere else, says Himberg.
It would be hard for visitors to watch the Finnish police drone activity.
We're being asked for training.
Further generalisation
Himberg recalls that it is very important to find someone who has disappeared in the winter of Finland as soon as possible.
As has been said, in the case of Raahe, the lost were found only in a few minutes with the help of the drone.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, they're supposed to be trained more.
Drone is already much used in police tasks, and its use will become more frequent and will increase in the future.
That's what I'd dare say, Himberg tells me.
In addition to searching for the missing, the police may use drones, for example, for accident or crime scene investigations and certain types of intelligence.
For example, we already need to check some area a little further, where it is possible to fear that violence will be faced there.
Drone can then be used for pre-medication.
Karjalan Rugby rose to the 1st Divar
Karjalan Rugby is celebrating a 2-division victory in Kuopio on Saturday.
The Joensuuns were still in the middle of the game with 7-12 kills for Helsinki Rugby Club, but in the second period they found a plot and opened the south guests 26-12.
At the same time, the 2-division Championship knew the historic rise of Karelian Rugby to its 1-division.
In the past, the club has played in number one, but the Finnish Rugby series had been divided into two levels, the SM series and the multi-part 1 division.
The Society intends to accept the place, but it knows a lot of work next winter.
The current almost twenty player's roster must be raised to 25.
The 1-division also knows the increase in the number of games and longer gaming trips, so the fundraising must also be in line with it.
Kotkaniemi begins the season in Montreal, confirm the head coach
The main coach of the Montreal Canadiens in the hockey NHL Claude Julien confirmed the company's Twitter account that Finnish winner Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked a superpromise on Kotkaniemi, 18, in the first round of three summer bookings.
The attacker joined Montreal's training strength for the rest of the summer and has presented strong extracts in September training matches.
The Kotkaniemi was immediately able to finish the goal in his first training match.
Julien, the main coach, praised the Finnish for having taken major developments after arriving at the guest camp.
The NHL regular series starts next week in the night against Thursday in Finland.
Montreal meets Toronto Maple Leafs on the opening round.
What's a good leader like?
This week, much has been said about leadership in Finland.
Risto Siilasmaa, Chairman of the Nokian Government, reported on his book Paranoid optimism at the HS interview, where he sheds light on the philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticises the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Olympa.
Olllila strongly challenged the accusations, but even in previous Nokia reports, the inability of the leaders to act as a team; fear and unspeakability, which caused the collapse of mobile business.
The company's ability to take risks and agility disappeared.
The Nordic Business Forum also organised a business giant event in Helsinki, which attracted Finnish business cream to Messukeskus.
In addition to Barack Obama, the stage was raised by 12 stars in the business world.
Talking about good leadership was enough.
The legend of management doctrines, Gary Hamel, said that a good leader must dare to take the company to the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that those who are spiritually most involved in past decisions make decisions.
John Mackey, the founder of the Hell Foods chain, said that the manager must be able to communicate to the entire staff for the purpose of the company.
And that's not supposed to be just making a profit to the owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote about the introverts of the book of success, told us that the most successful leaders are, in fact, modest.
They act calmly, quietly and decisively.
Often they're introverts.
Professor Aswath Damodara, in the financial sector, recalled that the characteristics of a good manager must be met in one of the stages of the company's life cycle.
At the start of the company, the director must be able to tell the story on which the company's future is based.
The company that grew up in the mature phase needs a manager who knows the numbers.
The Nordic Business Forum listened to 7,500 visitors - mostly Finnish leaders.
As a threat, they had a flash of information.
A lot is required of a good leader.
So often, therefore, leadership goes wrong, even at the highest level.
Silasmaa and Olllia were also present.
They used to talk to each other when they were friends.
But they hardly considered whether Nokia had the right leaders at the right time.
And their humility was not easy for the outside to assess.
Sara Chafak arrived at a wonderful red carpet right from Los Angeles to spend most of his years abroad.
Model Sara Chafak arrived at the missionary in a wonderful black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finland dress also had a pits lahus.
It's just a little bit of jet lag.
I'm back from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there, and Chafak tells me he's famous.
Chafak says he's in Los Angeles for auditions.
He's done commercials, among other things.
He describes his work in the United States as interesting, as well as as in Finland.
However, he says that work must be done harder, since the model work is easy to find a replacement.
Gotta push harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.
Choreographer Sonya Lindfors 30,000 euros live art award in Kuopio
Artist Sonya Lindfors won 30 000 euros of cultural prize on Saturday in Kuopio.
Lindfors, awarded the Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art, is working on choreography, social activistism and teaching.
Sonya Lindfors' art is vital to its immediate surroundings.
His work gives others the opportunity to work and create spaces for dialogue on environments which they have previously missed, the framework described the winner.
In addition to the Finnish Lindfors, a number of international artists were nominated.
The award is awarded annually to a live art artist or group operating on the field.
The Danish police found the great Volvo on the operation: "We can't tell you where"
The large-scale search of the Danish police has produced results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed on the bridges of the Iron of July and the Big Belt.
All land and ferry transport from the island of Själlän was closed to Sweden, Germany and the rest of Denmark.
The police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS has reached out to the chief of staff of the Copenhagen Police Media Centre.
They found the car.
We can't tell you where the car was found yet, so Henrik Storm of Copenhagen police reports to Ilta-Sanom.
According to Storm, the black Volvo we're looking for has no direct connection to the threat.
He says the biggest danger is over.
The Danish officer, Extra Bladet, told me about the police's Saturday news conference.
Detective Director Jørgen Bergen Skov was at the end of the silent operation.
He didn't want to tell us what criminal code was used to investigate the case.
However, Skov said it was a "serious crime".
It was a threat to people's lives.
Three people have been searched for in the operation.
The police won't tell us if they've already been caught.
According to the newspaper, restrictions on ferry transport have been lifted.
Copenhagen Police also followed events on their Twitter account.
The STT states, however, that according to the police, the general public no longer has a cause for concern, as the threat was for certain people.
The name of Macedonia has caused a gap for decades - now the people will vote on it in the debate
In the Balkans, Macedonia is currently voting on a proposal for a new name.
According to the Macedonian and Greek Governments Agreement, the name would be the Republic of North Macedonia.
To date, Greece has blocked the efforts of Macedonia to become a member of NATO and the EU with its veto right.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The question of a referendum is not a new name, but a question is whether or not the voters are in favour of membership of the EU and NATO in Macedonia by accepting the agreement.
The vote began in a veritably manner, at least at a school in the centre of Skopje, the capital.
Olivera Argirosvka, a retired nurse who voted in school, hoped to support the agreement.
The referendum means change if it opens doors to Europe and NATO.
It means change especially for young people, he said.
In 1991, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been officially referred to as ‘the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's government has campaigned for the adoption of the agreement.
On the other hand, the national right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for boycott to give referendums.
In addition to the result, it is exciting to see whether the vote rises by more than 50%.
The referendum is not binding, but yes or no victory would allow the mandate to change the Constitution.
The amendment of the Constitution requires a majority of two-thirds of Parliament.
The Greek Parliament, too, has yet to accept the agreement.
The polling stations are closed from 8:00 p.m. to Finnish time.
Nice victory!
Robert Helenius killed Erkan Teper
Robert Helenius met late Saturday night at the heavy series of Erkan Teper in a professional poisoning match in Germany.
A 34-year-old Finnish took the measure of his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, near Stuttgart.
The main game tonight was the Intercontinental title match of the heavy series of the IBF Union.
Its winner can be given the opportunity to cope with the harder tasks seen on Saturday, with significant economic importance.
Helenius solved the match in the eighth round, when he knocked Teper with his hard left hand.
Teper couldn't get off the floor anymore.
"Nordic Nightmare" already hurt his opponent in the third period, when the German nose started bleeding.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They were supposed to fight in December 2015.
That's when Teper appealed to the injury and withdrew from the fight.
Then it turned out that the German had run twice in the doping test.
Helenius has taken the names of his professional career matches for 28 matches and suffered two losses.
Teper has won 19 professional matches and lost three times.
Hamilton's stable order to win the difference to 50 points already.
The Formula One Championship approached its confirmation again, as Mercedes Lewis Hamilton won the Russian Gp and stretched its MM line to Ferrari Sebastian Vettelli 50 points (306-256).
There's only five more races left.
Valteri Bottas, who left the pole, drove second.
Last year at Sotsh, Bottas, who took his career in the opening victory, held the top place for the midways of the race, but Mercedes told Botta to get past Hamilton.
Vettel was driving third, Ferrari Kimi Räikkönen was driving fourth.
Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who started from the last line of departure, was the fifth.
The twin assaulted a Jewish man in Joensuu... got caught a block away.
Two men assaulted and kicked a 31-year-old Jewish man in Joensuu at Siltakatu 12 on Saturday after 6 p.m.
According to the police, the men also intercepted the victim's phone, among other things.
The police reached out to the suspects, i.e. the 35-year-old male in the haystack and the 39-year-old man in the mermaids, shortly after the event.
They were arrested on suspicion of a robbery, the police will tell us.
The victim had bruises that didn't require medical attention.
Elon Musk, CEO of the electric car company Tesla, is leaving his role as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company.
Musk has agreed with the US authorities.
At the same time, Musk has been fined for $20 million in his fifth claim that he would have secured funding to withdraw Tesla from the stock market.
The US Securities Commission SEC has accused Musk of fraud in securities.
Musk will continue as CEO of Tesla, but the company will also have to pay fines of EUR 20 million if the agreement between the authorities and Musk is confirmed by law.
Canada is fighting against time to make peace with the United States of America
There is a risk that time will end in the negotiations between the United States and Canada on the free trade agreement with Nafta.
The United States has set the threshold for Sunday, and the country's negotiators have discussed closely throughout the weekend.
Canada's chief adviser, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed his speech at the UN General Assembly in order to concentrate on trade negotiations at the fullest.
On President Donald Trump's request, the United States, Canada and Mexico started negotiations about a year ago to reform the North American Free Trade Agreement.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached agreement, but agreement with Canada has not yet been established.
The United States and Mexico want to bring the agreement into force before the Mexican presidential elections win Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador takes office at the beginning of December.
Trump has said that Canada's involvement in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that plans to sign the contract at the end of November were with or not Canada.
In view of these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday in order to allow sufficient time for the US Congress to assess it.
The neighbor thought the candles were lit up as a fire in Kakkuri. The fire department was alerted.
The candles burned in the apartment building in Kaakuri in Oulu caused a fire alarm on Sunday night.
A dozen rescue units were called in because of a possible fire at the apartment building.
There it came to light that candles burned in the sauna of the apartment building had appeared to the opposite house as a fire, so the emergency center had been notified.
There was no fire on the target.
The police picked up 11 people after the Honka-HJK game... banging on the field and at the metro station.
After the Honka-HJK match, 11 people were captured on Saturday in Espoo, the West U.S. Police Inspector Teemu Värtinen confirmed to the STT.
The grounds for attachment were to protect against crime and disorder.
Those who were taken were released after the situation had calmed down, Värtinen said.
I've heard about your interest earlier in the evening of Sanoma.
The fight ended at 0-0.
After the final call, a large number of viewers rushed to the field from the view reserved for the supporters of the HJK.
The situation led to push-ups and fist fights between team supporters.
Among other things, horse police were needed to put an end to this situation.
In addition to the field, a banging took place in an area near the metro station, where part of the captures also took place.
I wasn't there, but what I saw in the pictures was unpleasant, and Värtinen referred to the banging on the field.
According to the colour, as a result of the events, no report of crime has been made.
The tablestone hassled the butterfly in its SE time in the world cup, Laukkanen also swims to the finals
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Tablestone have advanced to the finals on the final day of the 3/7 World Cup Competitions in the Netherlands.
They're swimming in Eindhoven on a short track.
The HSS Tablestone alarmed Finland's record in 50 meters of butterflying, where he was the second of the elements at 22.82.
In September, Tablestone swims in Helsinki during the journey of the SE-time 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen, representing the Espoo Cettus, was butterfly 24s at 24.68.
Swimming Club Vuukatin Laukkanen was in the 50-metre front of the breast swimming at the sixth time of 30.48 and advanced to the final.
In the original of two hundred meters of blending, Laukkanen was 15 in time 2.14,25.
Students play a rare treat: ancient tragedy - a reduced Oresteia affects its visual appearance
Ancient tragedy is rare in Finnish scenes.
For example, an ancient tragedy, the Sofokleen Filoctetes, was last seen in the National Theatre in 1988.
The Theatre College now brought to the tour of the National Theatre the only fully preserved drama trilogy in ancient history, Aiskhilos Orestea.
In the Lavat open! projects launched in 2015 the actress students of the Theatre Academy work internationally with the professional director.
This fourth project, like the first one, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
In April, Orestea received her international premiere in Berlin.
Reconciliation of the Roiha from Orestia summarises the report of the end of the Atreus family who was doomed to destruction and the birth of the rule of law to 20 minutes, in particular by the consolidation of chorus shares.
The work succeeds in being very loyal to the spirit of Kirsti Simon Nagye's fine work (2003).
Dramatic lights and displaying the pages of the theatre space highlight the simple and bright stage thinking.
Its centre alternately consists of dynamics between actors who leave the choir and those who act as nominal roles.
The performance uses doubles and triples for roll names.
Actors do not leave the stage at all, so, for example, the murders of Agamemnon, returning from the Troy War, and of Kassandra, for example, are shown on the stage, contrary to the tradition of ancient performance.
Of course, the performance does not emphasize that it is loyal to the ancient performance tradition.
Rather, a modern, loyal interpretation of the text is created before the viewer’s eyes, who is constantly aware of his ritual roots.
Roiha has managed to get out of the master stage as a close group, directly as an organism, even a band of rhythmists.
In particular, actors who tend to be very expressive, sculptively inclined to group formations are able to access their rights on a naked basis, only by decorating the white curtain, on the stage.
That's impressive.
The performance tour of Orestea continues with the Theatre of Kouvola and Oulu.
Korean manufacturer manufactures his first hydrogen load
The new Treaty with Hyinda and Swiss H2 Energy is starting to become visible in Europe.
According to the cooperation agreement published at the Hannover IAA commercial vehicle exhibition, Hyundai will provide the new model of a thousand car lots to the Swiss company and its partners.
By placing a fuel cell truck on the market Hyundai will continue with the Nexon and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models as the manufacturer of hydrogen cars.
With this quality, the world's first project, we are taking fuel cell technology further and further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market area of these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the refuelling network, the Vice President of Hyundai Motor, In Cheol Lee, said in the field of publication of the contract.
The fists used to ring over and over in Kajaan
A man in his 30 ’ s assaulted three men at a restaurant in downtown Kajaan and outside on Saturday morning.
He first hit one man inside of the restaurant, resulting in his removal.
Outside, he pushed another man to the ground, and when the third man had failed, he was still hit by the aggressor.
The police picked up the assailant.
At the police station, the man continued to act aggressively and to kick another cop in the leg.
He also threatened the police with assault and killing.
The man was taken to jail to calm down.
It will be investigated in three cases of assault and violence against an official.
In the middle of Kajaan, another case of assault also occurred on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, a 20-year-old Kajaan man hit the victim.
A little later, another man poured him down, and the man who hit him earlier still kicked the victim.
The outsiders pulled out of the victim's room and the police called.
But it's about time the guys left before the police arrived.
The police ask the witnesses of the event to contact the Kajaan police by phone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail investigation.kainuu@poliisi.fi.
Long-line radio driver Erkki Pälli is dead.
Erkki Pälli, well-known as a long-term journalist, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio Leader Erkki Pälli, 83, is dead.
He died of incurable liver cancer, which he reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Yeah, we're done here.
Even the doctor has said that, I live daily at a time, he commented on his situation in the Evening magazine a month ago.
The security of aunts and uncles in the store must be guaranteed.
The first time I ever got paid for a magazine thing in 1984.
When something about these rings of the year surprises me, it is usually a big news story.
When I wrote (Karyan, 27 September) about the insecurity of the workers in the retail trade, I was astonished and, at times, somewhat angry.
I also spoke about the issue of the Trade Union for Services (PAM) as an expert on the working environment, Erika Käärä.
He says that crime statistics do not tell the real situation.
The problem is growing, although the employers, of course, claim otherwise.
The police report only clearly serious cases and many of the real cases of violence remain unreported.
"Of course, companies have a duty to statistics on their close-up situation under the Labour Safety Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and do not collect their data anywhere," he said.
Mental injuries don't end up in the statistics.
In situations of violence, the problem has always been that they do not always cause physical injury.
Despite this, mental trauma can be far more serious than bruises and wounds.
It is difficult to draw the difference between a violent situation and a threatening state of violence when an aggressive threat of a certain level must also be considered to be violence - even if there is no intervention.
Too many people are afraid of their jobs, even though the real thing doesn't happen.
Some areas of residence are restless.
The store's got guards.
Even with the opening hours of the shops, the media had a rather large impact on the safety of the sellers.
"A long time ago, many employers arranged security services for at least night-time feelings and to prevent work alone," Kohärä commented.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is drawn.
This would seem to have had an effective effect now, but this will produce a new negative trend.
When, due to the guarding, the disturbances remained well - held, it was a dream that the guarding would be unnecessary.
Now, in many places, we are trying to find solutions that could remove expensive security services.
Mild abuse is a criminal offence and it is quite understandable that the abused seller does not want to request an investigation into a criminal who usually resides close to a trade.
However, according to the same point of law in 2011, mild abuse will become the prosecution if it occurs at the workplace.
I think we need precedents now.
Next time an aunt or uncle is being assaulted, the police should investigate and the prosecution.
When justice puts a few abusers in prison, and the sentence comes from the hard end of the penalty scale, the customs would be cleaned up.
A society where the food trade must be open almost overnight in small towns must guarantee the safety of workers.
Heidi Sohlberg signed a receipt to Miss before the direct broadcast began, "Sara, Iro is married"
Missi's crowning will not be seen in the traditional way on TV this year, but will be shown on the Viafree site.
The transmission is run by the former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and the host of the NHL and KHL studios of Viasat and Viaplay.
Backstage and the red carpet are plotted by Janni Hussi.
Before the direct transmission, the host three informed the invited visitors who arrived and the representatives of the media about the course of the transmission.
At first, Sohlberg asked the public to give Harjula a few good applause.
Now all the women scream!
Now, look at this man drinker of ours, Sohlberg cheered his fellow Member while cheering the audience.
Many previous years, Miss Finland, will follow the front page of the competitions.
Among other things, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sat side by side and Sohlberg made a little joke in either direction.
Sara, Iro is married!
Sohlberg locked up looking at Saro.
The more likely Sohlberg referred to the recently divorced Sieppi, who laughed at the comment, although at first it looked confused.
For the first time in the newspaper of the Evening Word weekend, the Siege spoke of his resignation.
Missikaunotar said that he did not want to open the reasons for the difference in the public domain, because it is between him and Roope Salminen.
He said he wasn't in a hurry for another relationship, he was going to focus on himself.
I'm focusing on my own things, and especially I'm starting to live my own life alone, Sara Sieppi told me.
The status of harjula’s marriage appeared at a later stage when Sohlberg accidentally called Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula a party.
The host three laughed at me.
I mean, the iro was married, or how did it go?
Janni Hussi signed up.
The man in the north tortured the bound with a straight cut, burning, and feeding the powerful sauce
The District Court of Ostrobothnia has sentenced a 34-year-old man in Kokkola to three years in prison for numerous crimes against his commonwealth.
Among other things, it was a belt, cable, and ties.
The court condemned the articles in question to the State.
The state's charge involved a suspect in a serious rape.
However, the district court rejected this charge.
The chef was accused of four abuses, gross assault, coercion, illegal threats, freedom abuse, gross freedom abuse, and two injuries.
Crimes occurred between 26 March and 24 May.
At the end of the last acts, the man was arrested and captured a few days later.
On Thursday last week, the District Court of Ostrobothnia delivered its judgment and ordered a 34-year-old to continue to be held in the prison of Vaasa.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-olds were also accused of two serious violations of freedom and of a gross rape on the 22nd of May.
However, the Court rejected these accusations as unseen.
The case was dealt with in court behind closed doors.
However, the district judge gave a public report on the judgment.
According to the district judge, the accused had targeted violence, threats, and coercion against his spouse in situations where he had been bound.
The accused cut his victim with a knife, smoked with a cigarette, fed him strong sauce and poured water and coffee on top of it.
In its judgment, the court ordered the State to have lost the means of crime: the belt and cable, the straps, the bath belt, the knife and the Vesuri.
Four Witnesses
According to the Circumstances, the parties continued to live together between actions.
It can be read from the resolution that a large proportion of the most serious acts took place at the end of the period of crime.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were heard in the court.
The victim’s 34-year-old should pay compensation for pain, suffering, suffering and temporary harm to a total of EUR 5800.
I don't think he has that money, because the convicted already has debts in the inheritance.
The prison sentence isn't a man's first.
The newspaper doesn't mention the name of the convicted person to protect the privacy of the victim.
This is not the case when you write a new district court judgment.
Europe at the top of four points to the Ryder Cup solution
European golf professionals captured their leaders on Saturday in a traditional hole game against the United States.
Europe will lead the Ryder Cup to be played in Paris at points 10-6, while on Sunday there will still be twelve doubles to be played.
Europe won three of the four four-ball matches that started on Saturday, and the four-games this afternoon were equal to two-two.
The European leaders were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches he played on Fridays and Saturdays.
In the past, no European couple had reached the same level.
On Sunday, the twin seeks more history.
No European player has won five points in the Ryder Cup together, and no American player has reached as many as three: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
H.J.K. condemns the violent harassment of its supporters in the Honka match: "Violentity is not part of football"
On Sunday, the football betting team HJK published a release condemning the interference of its supporters in the FC Honka game on Saturday in Tapiola.
"We apologize for the events after the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters", states the press release.
At the end of the fight, some 50 HJK supporters rushed to the field and some seemed to try to challenge Honga's supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
The organizations did not calm down the situation, they needed police officers, and they also needed policemen.
The HJK reports that the team’s players and staff are shocked by what has happened.
Events after the fight are not in accordance with the values of our 111-year-old company.
"We strongly resign from any action that endangers the safety of the match events", states the press.
The HJK promises to assist authorities and event organisers in identifying safety threats and removing mild phenomena.
Support culture is part of football and an important issue for HJK.
We support in every way positive, joyous and stimulating activities in football views.
"Peace doesn't belong to it," says the press release.
The Philippines inventor flies a drone car to avoid traffic congestion.
Mendila is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Peloton.
Now he's part of a world-growing group that swears he's invented a flying car, or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, for example, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in the mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from the world, a man has used much of his assets to build his dream.
He started developing his flying car six years ago.
Now he's calling the developmental version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made the first successful test flight... he sailed his equipment at altitudes over seven metres.
One of his objectives was to avoid traffic congestion.
I hope that the device will give rise to positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, and Mendiola said according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL predicts: Work-related activities will be displayed tomorrow in children's day care and in social and health services
In the public and well-being sectors starting tomorrow, the bans on overtime and switchovers are particularly visible in social and health services and day-care for children, as assessed by JHL President Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The effects will be extensive and will certainly be visible in such a way that there is insufficient staff present.
Everyone has to think about how to pick up their children.
The employer's task is now to ensure that the services are played and that no one's life is threatened, Niemi-Laine says to the STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the shortage of workers was also apparent at the beginning of the year when JHL members were banned from working overtime and exchange because of contractual negotiations.
Through flexibility, employers have made it possible that the staff have not been hired, but that the workers have been working overtime or changed shifts.
This is not a labour-related campaign yet.
It is normal in terms of health and safety at work that regular working hours are taken care of and only done for each worker.
JHL opposes the government's intention to reduce the protection of the dismissal of small companies.
Markku Jalonen, the social manager of municipal employers, will not make any prior assessment of the impact of the bans on overtime and switchover.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although the services may deteriorate.
Employers around Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations that can be done.
The area is so vast, social and health activities and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The effects can vary very much between sectors, regions and employers, Jalonen said to the STT.
Jalonen says that last week, among other things, three days' experience was gained from similar activities carried out by the Close and Core Care Association, the Super and the Social and Health Trade Union, Tehty.
Their effects were rather limited.
JHL's ban on working overtime and exchange applies, for example, to municipal, church, state and private social and health workers.
For example, family day care is restricted outside.
At this stage, the labour fight concerns almost 100 000 JHL members.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL may last a long time.
The Alliance is also prepared for other labour-related measures if the Act of Deployment continues to be prepared.
The government should now admit that this is where we run into the wall and hard.
In the opinion of Mr Nozzo, both the Ay movement and the government must come against us.
What's strange is that the tough ones are already in the pipe, even though the show hasn't been given yet, Jalone is updating.
A large coral rite is born in the fitness circles of children and adults to study the walrus and the sea horse.
In other places, the Grand Corallery was first served last spring in Hamburg, and last Saturday it was presented for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
As in previous works of the group, the Great Coralirity is a work that is built from the beginning to the end, together with the public.
This time, however, a clearer presentation will also be built, which will refresh and crystallise the findings made in the initial exercises.
There's a lot of sad magic in the theater for the kids.
The child’s perspective has already been included in the preparation phase of the work.
However, the great coral rite is not a children’s performance, but a performance that adults and children are doing in collaboration.
It provides adults with information and observations on how children receive knowledge and make art.
The ability of children to throw themselves at exercises and joint games will also dissolve the distance between adults and children.
The great coral rite is somewhat similar to the saddle, the fitness circle and the natural awareness, but it is finally felt in other forms, in non-human conditions around the visits.
The large coral reef begins with the introduction of corals and coral reefs of living organisms and fish.
In six different fitness circles, among other things, instruction is given to the movements of the moose and the sea horse.
Finally, a performance of less than an hour in which music, lights, shiny paints and suits help you to get to know the life of the coral reef.
There are both divers and divers who observe the life of the coral reef as well as corals that are being considered.
In addition, corals are the target organisms.
The eyes and observations shown in many directions make the presentation dense and lively.
Whether there is a landscape of an organism, a landscape - looking organism, or another organism or landscape that looks at the organism, and all this at the same time.
For children, it doesn't seem that difficult.
In other places, the group aims at a border between thinking and action, which is challenging when it consists of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the participation of children makes it more important.
After the workshop, Sitrator will conduct a silent demonstration on behalf of the threatened corals.
The destructions beyond human understanding should not be allowed to harden, even if it could be difficult to understand the significance of exercising one’s own compassion in the face of destruction.
In other places, the work has been built in such a way that it respects the diversity of life with political gesture.
There are other generations, there are different kinds of consciousness, other species, and their future generations, for whose wonders and games it clears the space.
The kids are growing up too fast. I'm glad I didn't have smart phones when I was a kid.
Children and young people today are more irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking all the time when they are younger and younger.
I think that children should have children all the time and not mess up their lives because of drugs and sex, because others say they do.
I was embarrassed when my friend told me he had to pick up his sister in fifth grade this weekend from a "boy friend".
When she came to get her drunk sister, she told me about her sex experiences that night.
There's no way I could imagine my own sister in the same situation because we've been told and warned throughout our childhood that drugs should not be touched and sex is an adult thing.
I hope that children today will be able to live with proper childhood and that they do not need to grow up too early because of the group pressure created by friends.
I keep seeing the younger girls in Instagram who are in their pictures wearing makeup and revealing their clothes on.
Snapchat is used for taking and sending pictures that reveal at night.
It's even more difficult for girls to guess what age they are.
Today’s 13-year-olds can easily look like 18-year-olds and parents.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad I didn't have smartphones when I was a kid.
I had to be a child for many years, and I didn't have to think about what other people were thinking about me.
YLE: The authorities have informed the government that the Airisto Helmi case is not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, who was interviewed by the High Representative, the Defence Police and Defence Forces went to inform the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees earlier this week.
The Finnish Government has been informed that the investigation of Airisto Helme is not currently related to national security, but to organised crime, says Yle.
The information on these sources was confirmed by Ilkka Kanerva (cok), Chairman of the Defence Committee.
According to Kanerva, the Defence Forces and the Defence Police visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is considered primarily economic crime.
They were rather strict about not speculating that there was more, Kanerva commented in the interview with Ylen.
According to the above data, no evidence of a link to national security has so far been found on the seized material, but the investigation is only in progress.
There is no way to know what can be revealed there yet, one of Ylen’s interviews notes.
A week ago, large home search in Turku and the mainland has raised the question of whether the investigation is purely economic crime or a threat to internal security in Finland.
Earlier this week, the paper produced a case where claims are being examined both in favour and against.
Video: The dream painting saved Liverpool's loss series
Liverpool’s 100 percent Valioliiga initiative was completed, but it was still more satisfied with the team’s 1-1 game on Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday it will be exactly the year when Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and escaped to the 1-0 guest victory.
That's when the combination of Pep Guardola sent out the entire Valioliga signal that City was serious now.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And I'm sure the Liverpool manager, Jörgen Klopp, came to West London with the same idea.
The Reds had begun Valioliga with six consecutive profits.
Liverpool began stronger, and especially Virgil van Dijk seemed to rule the field alone after his own end.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had a great league victory on Anfield Road less than Wednesday.
Then Eden Haard rose from the bench to solve the match with a wonderful personal performance.
And now, of course, she was there right from the beginning.
At 25 minutes, he first played with Mateo Kovacic and Jorgenho in a small space.
Finally, the Croat saw Hazard rushing forward and sent him a perfectly weighted pass.
Hazard got a little out of control, but he bombed a perfect left foot in the back corner of the bet.
Pool's brassi guard, Alison, was a little slow in his fight, and he didn't get his fingertips in the ball.
Klopp must have felt the defeat position was slightly unfair, as almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger cleaned up Mo Salah’s direction from the finish line.
During the second period, the Chelsea-Veskar Kepa was able to take real action.
The Basque guard quickly reacted to Sadio Mané's bet and pushed the ball from the top to the corner.
At the other end, Alison zeroed her throw-out via the Hazard.
The best place for the guests came at 72 minutes when James Milner found his focus on Bobby Firmino.
However, the Brassi star bump was headed toward David Luiz, a country teammate who saved the host’s leadership.
And it couldn't last another 89 minutes when the exchanger Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot at 25 meters.
Sturridge played with his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed it on the top of an irresistable bet.
Liverpool's 100-percent league launch ended with a 1-1-track, but it's still in the league together with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also strictly involved in the championship with two points behind the top.
In the discussion on the transmission of watches, the batteries are deep
I remember a few decades ago a magazine asked various Finnish influences, which divides the people of Finland.
The only thing I remembered was the answer to the juice widow: the Nen-end.
Some have a no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-
I mean, there's a lot of Jakolin lines that can be born anywhere, and here's one of them.
In the EU, Finland has made it possible to give up the annual time shift.
Very many agree that the shifting of watches twice a year has been the work of fools and has caused a wide variety of problems.
Finally, this achievement seems to be at least the easiest stage of the solution in Finland, although it has not been easy.
It is now difficult to decide what time it will end at: the current summer or winter season or some other time zone.
The public can also express their views on this on the otatkana.fi page.
The questionnaire has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and will be open until Friday 12 October.
The debate is fiercely held on coffee tables and social media, and everyone has their words to say.
In winter, defenders justify their position by morning light on people’s well-being and summertimes are protected by evening light on people’s desire for outdoors and thus on their well-being.
Both have strong supporters and good arguments.
Studies also show that morning light beats people’s day and gives them a freshness.
On the other hand, if not particularly affected by awakening in the dark, the light will increase the movement of people outside and give better opportunities for, for example, autumn yards.
The number of additional lights after the normal working day has already been calculated for one hour.
I'd rather take both, but the bad thing is, we're in the north of the planet, we can't do anything.
Winters are too dark and summers are too bright for many anyway.
It is typical for a debate on the subject that one is driven and another is strongly opposed.
The argument put forward by the opponents is hardly heard, because the most important thing is how it feels about itself.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on the matter, it is somewhat unnecessary to try to turn the other person’s head around.
There's a piece of powder in it.
The subject is extremely easy to debate, because it does not require a great deal of commitment and a feeling of feeling is sufficient to justify it.
A similar type of issue is generally argued with the most severe and equally infertility.
I'm sorry if the wrong option gets chosen, but I'm sure you'll adapt to that.
And it always offers a suitable scapegoat if life seems to be narrow.
Josba fought for a close-up victory.
The first guest game in the Salibandy Divar produced three series against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba left Seinäjoki for a joyous 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory with him.
The Nurmo led with paint at the beginning of the third round, but Joba applied for compositions and recycled men in chains.
In 50.47, the brothers Eutu and Juuso Lehtiniemi were plotting a six-to-five victory goal.
When both teams were frozen, decisive minutes were played at the equatorium.
Josba was most effective at Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was fiery anyway when Teemu Cinderella (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Mika Kosonen (1+0) also played in the second chain at the time of birth.
Josbala has six points after three rounds.
The next one will be the O2-Jyväskylä guests in two weeks' time.
The 200th anniversary of Eno's church on Sunday
The 200th anniversary of the Eno Church will be celebrated tomorrow Sunday in a very sad atmosphere.
The arson of the Church of Exhibition was a shock a week ago.
The church of Eno was also guarded on two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, there's still a party tonight.
Even if no one would like to, the Church of Eno is now the oldest church of the Joensuu Congregation.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno, despite all the municipal and other associations of the world.
The family fair starts at Eno's church today at 10 a.m.
Then we go to the congregation house at the shepherd’s feast table.
There are things in the program all day long, both inside and outside.
For example, you can get to know the church building under the guidance of Ari Räsäsen, who retired for 37 years.
The celebration of the church’s birth also means the end of one era.
The church house, built in 1982, has already been disabled, keeps its doors open for the last time today.
Now we're at the old municipal building, says Kappainen Markku Koistinen.
The church house was destroyed by internal air problems, but the church has been healthy for 200 years now.
Elon Musk will resign from the position of the President of the Tesla Government - the fraud charges were settled for $40 million
The electric car manufacturer Tesla and the CEO of Elon Musk have agreed to a legal case with the US Securities Authority SEC.
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of security fraud, and Musk was in danger of being left behind as a result of a company he had set up.
However, the Musk may continue as CEO of Tesla.
On the other hand, Musk will have to leave the Tesla Board of Directors for a period of three years.
The company will have to hire the chairman of an outside government.
Musk is also subject to tighter control.
The agreement requires Tesla to hire two independent directors and to monitor Musk's communications more closely in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk both pay 20 million dollars (about 17 million euros) to settle the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent new market disruptions and disadvantages to Tesla shareholders," says Director Steven Peikin of the SEC.
The case started in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might take the company off the market.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding was secured.
The receipt of the receipt of the receipt of the receipt of a letter of formal notice from the Court of Justice of the European Union was published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
The SEC suspected Muski was guilty of security fraud.
According to the Agency, the TVite was false and misleading, and Musk had not talked about the arrangement with any other management or potential funders of the company.
In practice, the agency accused Muski of misleading investors.
The SEC announced on Friday that it would sue the company and Musk.
The SEC stated that it claimed that Musk should be fined and that it should no longer be held by listed companies.
The SEC’s challenge scared investors, and Tesla’s share began to decline sharply.
More than 800 people died in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
The number of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and its subsequent tsunamis has risen to at least 832, says the country’s disaster agency according to AFP.
The number of deaths is still expected to increase, as the investigation of the damage is ongoing.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure may rise to thousands.
The Friday earthquake raised the tsunami that attacked the island of Sulawes in the city of Please.
A warning was given immediately after the quake, but it was quickly withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all known deaths are from Palu at least for the time being.
The rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the region of Donggala near the centre of the earthquake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Even now, a lot of people know they're dead.
Requests for assistance from the demise
The Indonesian army has been alerted to help rescue workers look for victims.
President Widodo, who arrived today, called on the soldiers to continue their rescue efforts without passing out day and night.
One of the centers of the rescues is the hotel in Palu, which is still believed to have 50-60 people in its ruins.
The head of the rescue agency, Muhammad Syaugi, said that one of the ruins of Roa-Roa Hotel, popular by business travelers, was able to dig one person alive at night.
We also heard people's requests for help, he told us.
According to Syaug, heavy drilling equipment would quickly be needed in the quake and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their loved ones who are missing.
Help me, you're in the Request and the neighborhood.
My friend's family were still missing, one of the authors appealed to the Facebook group.
Politicians' telephone numbers leaked into the hands of an intruder in Britain.
Many British politicians suffered harassment when their contact information leaked because of the deficiencies in the application's encryption.
Among other things, the troublemakers had access to the ministers' telephone numbers.
It was an application used at the British Conservative Party's party meeting in the government.
For example, Michael Gove, the Minister of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and Boris Johnson, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, are subject to harassment.
Several MPs received harassment calls.
In view of the lack of encryption of the application, the public was able to access the political profiles that were in the mobile app of the Conservative Party's annual meeting.
The audience was able to access the profiles by using the politician's email address, which was easily available online.
The profile entry was able to view and edit the data stored in the profile.
Someone managed to change Boris Johnson's profile picture for a moment into a porn picture and title insulting.
Michael Goven's profile picture was replaced by a picture of the media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting application allows for login to other people’s profiles at these e - mail addresses.
Then you can view the contact information of the profile person and send messages in the name.
The meeting application made each journalist, politician and participant’s telephone number publicly, Foster criticised.
The Conservative Party informant apologized for the leak.
He said that the technical problems have been solved and that the application is now working safely.
The ICO is supported by the British Information Authority.
The app was designed by the Australian Crown Comms company.
The Labour Party in the opposition criticises the fact that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in matters of security.
Every week, there are a large number of roll-over Poles in the audience of The Wall Finland.
Sightseeing viewers drew attention to the reactions of the studio audience in the Wall Finland programme.
The US Wall, which was rapidly spreading around the world, landed on the Finnish version of Nelos last Saturday.
The game show hosted by Heikki Paasonen is filmed in the same studio in Poland where other international productions are made.
In the Polish studio, the possibilities were exceptional, as the size of the format was 12 metres high in the game wall required space from the farm.
During the opening period, the social media raised the audience of the programme, which was considered Polish.
On Twitter, we discussed whether the Poles might understand anything about the game to be played in Finland.
The director of the Four Domestic Programmes, Unne Sormunen, will illustrate the matter to the Evening Journal.
He tells us that the studio audience has close players, other Finns, foreign Finns living in Poland, as well as just Polish viewers.
The audience is made up of international beginners in Finnish production, just like the audiences of the Wall periods in other countries in the same production space.
In Finland too, there are such groups, so-called professional audiences, who visit the different programs, to back up the finger.
He recalls that following the game itself is not so difficult to understand, even if he does not understand the language in which it is played.
Red and green fallballs are easy to distinguish.
However, there are interpreters in the foreign language studio that do the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret events as a simulation for the studio director all the time.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells us what kind of slap is being thrown there for example and what the situation is going on, Sormunen says.
He compares the situation with David Hasselhoff’s activity in domestic production.
David Hasselhoff was in Talent Finland a few years ago.
He had a simulant in his ear all along, and he knew everything that was said in the illustrations in Finnish, the sum of the Ring.
The artifuge that has broken south of Japan is moving towards the main island - the authorities are warning us about the earthquakes and floods.
The authorities are also warning of possible landslides and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured by Taifoon Tram, but according to the authorities, major injuries have been avoided, and so far no information is available on the victims of death.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so heavy that it has turned cars around.
According to the NHK General Radio Company, people have been evacuated into shelters, and electricity has been cut by over 300 000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been cancelled, and the bullet trains are in some places stopping because of the storm.
The storm is expected to hit close to Osaka within half a day of Finland's time.
The capital Tokyo is not directly on the storm route, but there are also heavy winds and rains.
The trains have been cancelled today in Tokyo.
According to weather scientists, Trami tortures Japan until Monday.
The sky of the ancestrals became darker and darker
It's been a bad early days.
The sky was almost dark as soon as the team disappeared on Saturday at their home field in Vaasa for Sport by reading 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
There are now five consecutive losses for the Prussians, and there are two points in total for six rounds.
No Sights defender or two lower chain players have yet to score.
The pressure is growing all the time.
Against the sport, the audience was out of control when almost half of the game was left.
Six games are just played, and there is, of course, no reason to give up.
Of course, we need to be concerned, because we played so badly.
In particular, the performance of the second batch was shamefully bad, Jarno Kärki, who made the 1+2 power for the ace, told us.
Of course, the sport enjoyed a victory.
The team had a game down from Friday, so I thought it would have been visible.
Maybe it did, but Acet didn't know how to use it.
The number of visitors to the bread day continued to increase
The mother of the bread day, Pirkko Hyärinen, wonders at the audience of the event in the big hall.
Somehow, thought there might not be so many people this year, and Jehrine will think about it in the morning.
In the autumn of 2017 and at the same time as the Day of Bread, the Hungarian tractor competitions were organised, so perhaps the expectations would be that the audience could even decrease slightly from the previous year.
Otherwise it happened; the corridors were completely blocked before ten, the sellers reported the end of the products, the news porridge was sold more than 500 doses before, and the number of cars Hyvärinen heard the rise.
The estimate of the number of visitors has been about 6,000, and Hyärinen will tell you later this afternoon.
In the morning and the afternoon’s five - hour period, there was a particularly large programme for families with children, which, I think, attracted them to a set of records.
In addition, Hyvärine estimates that the event will reach even further.
The sellers also turn towards Liper every year from a larger area.
This year’s leaders, salesmen of handicrafts, pastries and harvest products, had arrived at nearly a hundred.
The mother of the bread day, Pirkko Hyärinen, wanted to see the audience in the hall.
At first, the harvest was blessed.
In the children's series Teija Kiviniemi's beautiful bread won the public vote.
11 different types of bread came to the children's bread competition.
Marjatta Vepsläinen, the winner of the Roasting Competition, spent the day at the Marts' pie shop.
7 x the most beautiful lamp - this is where you recognize a good lamp
Bring the space back to life, create the right atmosphere for decorating and read the book without tirelessly tired.
It's worth a hundred for good lighting.
We gathered together three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were given by Tarja Jokiniemi, Sales and Marketing Director of Innolux.
Do your eyes a favor
The importance of lighting is growing, the more years of age are behind us.
Sufficient light can help many with problems of age as the accuracy of their eyesight is diminished and more and more blindness is affected.
The need for light also grows older.
Sixties need light three times more than twenty years old.
So it is worth raining for health reasons on the healing effects of light and the characteristics of the lamp.
A good luminaire gives you enough light, but it doesn't dazzle, someiem's tip.
Create beauty around you
The beautiful interior comes out only with the right lighting solutions.
The decorator of this moment can afford to choose.
The popular is a japandi style that combines vitality, Scandinavianism and Japaneseism.
On the other hand, 70th-century inspired modern and playful retrotyl with strong colours, metal with different shades or ice cream colours has risen to a boom.
The truth is fascinating in the same way as in the home’s other interior.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Show your personality
On the other hand, more is being put into the home now than before, and the interior has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, they want a customized, brave luminaire with a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products with a known origin and designer.
So let's be well-designed, Jokiniemi says.
Not necessarily the latest trend lamp is purchased at home, but the timeless classic for which many years have been saved.
Certain types of timeless, jewelryy and elegant classics keep their surfaces from year to year, says Jokiniemi.
Thank you. Goodbye.
Kokoko showed the door to the Canadian winner after three games
Kokoko and the attacker Brendan O'Donnell's roads are breaking apart.
A total of three league games were played in the orange black by the Canadian winner, KooKoo explains in his release.
O'Donnell moved to KooKooho in August by a one-year contract, which included a probationary period until the end of September.
In the last season, a 26-year-old attacker played in KHL in the ranks of Kunlund Red Star and in the KHL farm in VHL in KRS Heilongjiang.
There's no record of O'Donnell's new company yet.
The gamer wants to set an example in recycling - the goods go to the world in recycling boxes, the plastic changed into paper.
In addition to games, games special business Gamer is currently recycling packaging materials.
The products of the stone leg trade are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered from online stores are packaged, for example, in packages from importers.
All the packages that come to us are going to be reusable.
We may use the boxes ten times, as long as the package is in order to be able to use it, Ville Purula Oulu’s Game Man tells us.
As a soft material, the company uses newspapers and similar recycled materials as a rule.
Dome plastic is avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we are going to move even in envelopes to recycling material.
The movement wants to set an example for others.
Surrounding is not an extra effort, according to Purula.
It's not a big problem to start recycling.
There will also be economic savings when, for example, re-use of cardboard packaging.
Recycling is suitable for the activities of the Gamer, as besides new products, the main product range includes, among other things, the games and equipment used.
Acquisition of each fashionable: The same shirt works in every outfit
Classical clothes work from season to season in a different dress than in a costume.
With their multifunctionality, they create the basis for a good wardrobe, as it is easy to put together different costumes at an affordable price around high-quality classics.
In autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality needles.
This category also includes the black hemisphere.
A black needle made of natural material with semi-capsulates cannot have an error.
It can be combined with direct pants, boring meat, or jeans, and it can be surrounded by a controlled outfit and a blushing style.
Half-toneu is suitable for a young modern dresser as well as for a classic, sophisticated style designer.
This is how you create a style.
In autumn, the trendy look comes from gold browns and wide-ranging blindsuits, black hemisphere and gray ankles.
The classic hemisphere, along with other classics, the blue-green Scottish screen and the wine-red laureates, form a women's and refined outfit.
Bring the black hemisphere to the edge by combining it with loose, trendy clothes: jeans, high boots, and thick pantyhoses.
Young and elegant!
Russian intelligence services have a long tradition of sabotage
There is no reason to believe that the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence SVR or military intelligence GRU would have abandoned this approach.
During the Soviet Union, the so-called DRG groups specialised in sabotage activities.
The name comes from the Russian words diversionno-razvedyvalenja group: sabotage and intelligence.
Agents in the western KGB of the Soviet security service prepared detailed plans for important sabotage sites, says the archival manager Vasili Mitroh (1922-2004) who missed the west of the KGB.
His data was published in Christopher Andrew's books at the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 2000s.
Targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil-processing plants, and gas pipelines.
In Germany, the KGB acquired DRG groups for cover operations in the Bundeswehr, railways, gamekeepers and certain entities.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed up in local Ukrainian police riots, set up inspection stations for those leading to Ukraine, and isolated Crimea from their mother country.
During the Cold War, agents hid in the landscape for sabotage groups packages containing mines, explosives, lighters, and media.
In 1998, the KGB’s hiding place was found in Switzerland, whose traps exploded when the authorities injected it with water cannons.
At night, the police reached four drunk drivers in the county.
Police caught four drivers across North Karelia on the night between Friday and Saturday.

HPK keeps Risk in line for the rest of the year, Lehtinen's probation period is over.
Mika Toivola, the sports director of Hämeenlinna HPK, says that Filip Risk (in the centre) has been important to the team in taking initiatives, under-playing and defending the fourth field.
During the trial period, the early fall Filip Risk continues for the rest of the season at Hämeenlinna HPK.
The success of the experienced Risk, 33, in the roles offered to him convinced the Society.
Philip has been an important part of our efforts, under-playing and the defensive role of the fourth field.
Although there is still something to improve, it is good for the young team to stick to this experienced player, Mika Toivola, the sports director of the HPK commented in the company’s announcement.
According to the wish, the worth of the risk increases when playing the League's solution games.
The Central Attendant Risk from Pietarsaari has played the league game earlier in JYP, Lock and Sport.

The real story on TV today: The climber was left to die twice
The American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on a man's own experience.
Tonight's film is based on it.
Everest now gets her first night on Finnish TV.
In May 1996 a devastating snowstorm surprised climbers at Mount Everest.
The direction of Baltasar Kormákur in 2015 describes the survival struggle that has been dealt with in grain.
The tragedy has been made into movies and documents... before.
Real events are going through in this case too.
22 years ago, the world’s highest mountain took the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced tour leaders: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It's just that Hall worked as Weathers' guide.
Weathers' life could have been saved by an eye surgery before leaving Nepal.
As a result of that and the pressure on the air, he lost sight and therefore had to miss the peak.
Rob Hall kept on going, and he never came back.
However, Weathers’ struggle for life and death had just begun.
As the storm rose, he got lost, and he never found his way back to camp again.
When they came looking for a man, they found him in such poor condition that he was not believed to survive.
They left Weathers to die.
Yet, as if by a miracle, he was still able to get on his feet and find the others.
It was thought that the wicked Weathers were still dying, and once again they left him behind for their own good luck.
It is clear that, contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even the cruisers began to believe in the possibility of being helped.
In the movie, Beck Weathers is playing Josh Brol.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today's a 200-year-old Eno church.
An uncle's 200-year-old church has been celebrated today in church hill.
The church was consecrated on October 4, 1818, and the whole family’s celebration was prepared for Sunday.
The festival began at Eno’s church hill at 10 a.m. a family mass, after which there has been an antiquity on the cattle’s table at Eno’s parish house.
The church was full.
517 people attended the family fair.
Brother Armi Rautavuori was glad that so many people had come to the church.
It is a great joy for a long time and gives strength to work, Rautavuori (in the picture) says.
The fire of the Church of Excitement has touched many, and it was not ignored at the 200th anniversary of the Church of Eno.
The Church of Eno is now the oldest church of the Evangelical Lutheran congregations in Joensuu after its destruction in a fire.
The wooden church of the agitating danger was completed in 1770.
In the morning of the aggravation, a charter was arranged to silence and to remember the church destroyed in the fire.
Photos and videos: Medican flashed his power in Greece - The sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A powerful hurricane type of autumn storm rolled from lunch to Greece on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane is named Zorba.
The Greek air science institute has issued a red weather warning to the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian islands, Kykladi and Crete.
The images taken from the area show plenty of floods throughout Greece.
The video published on Twitter shows how the river has suddenly appeared between houses in the city of Kiato in the district of Corinth instead of the street because of floods.
The second video shows how the car has been transported by flood water.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese peninsula, the wind caused intense seagoing activity.
The Embassy of Athens in Finland instructs people on their Facebook pages to prepare for the storm in Greece.
The delegation invites the monitoring of weather information and local authorities' instructions.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medicane, brings heavy rains and even flood risk.
According to CNN, according to a 2011 study, the medians appear only once or twice a year around the world, typically around the September to October period, when the sea temperature is still high.
The current storm left floods in Tunisia and Libya before it continued its journey north and towards Europe.
There has also been concern in Greece about refugee camps on the islands, such as Lesbos.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to adequate protection.
In the summer, the areas destroyed by the landtops in Athens will also remain under the storm.
In Greece, the medican also raged last November.
We must not go into the sea now, yet our flights are still on schedule, with thousands of Finns on the Greek islands threatened by the autumn storm.
The voyages to the sea are cancelled and even on foot should be careful not to fly branches or other bulk goods on top of a storm.
Guides have distributed such instructions to just over 3,500 in Greece during the Finnish weekend on solar trips.
The instructions will be needed, because even the Zorbas storm, which is going to rise in fear readings, is expected to beat the islands of Greece this weekend.
For example, near the island of Crete, the wind speed may rise to 45 meters per second in the hips.
The rough rains that increase weather gloom.
According to the tour operators, all persons travelling through the Sun and Tui to Greece who have notified their telephone number have been warned about the wind through a text message.
Still in the air, the sun and heat
According to Inka Ikosen, the communications expert on solar travels said that by Saturday evening the worst resorts have been avoided.
For example, flights have landed and risen according to normal schedule.
Of course, we keep track of the situation all the time.
Security ahead goes.
I supported the media officer Antonia Schroderus says that their flights have also been scheduled.
We are constantly in contact with our target personnel.
At least Crete was still calm, he told us about the early night on Saturday night.
The most popular Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete, currently have a total of 1 500 Finnish passengers.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are on holiday in smaller destinations.
For example, on Sunday morning the worst storm on Kos Island is to be reached.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, Rhodes had also mocked the sun, and the temperature fell to 27 degrees.
It is estimated that Zorbas will turn into Turkey's next nuisance, though slightly relaxed.
We have already been in touch with Turkey and our staff there, and we have, for example, checked the number of Finns flying to Antalya in Tui, says Schroderus.
Shirly Karvis and Janni Huss have completely identical evening suits at the missionary, so they react to the situation.
The media personality and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Finland finals on Saturday in an open-back evening dress.
Hussi says he's got a dress from Messlew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals who found me a wonderful dress tonight, Hussi smiles.
The exact same silver evening dress had also been chosen by Shirly Karvinen.
The twin himself noticed the same outfit and reacted to the situation laughing.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanom that he was in a hurry to prepare, and he had to get on the plane.
The wolf acts as a backstage and red carpet driver in the missionary, and he talks about the front-line stars coming in.
Huss has a fresh move back because she moved from Kamp on Friday to Jäjäsaari.
I'm going to stay there for now. Let's see what happens.
The essential thing is that the new apartment has its own office, Hussi wondered.
Before he moved, Hussi was alone in Greece.
It was wonderful. I was only at the hotel for a week without going anywhere.
When the stress broke, I got the flu, but otherwise the vacation was really successful, Hussi tells me.
Shirly Karvisen's behavior in the plane attracted a lot of attention... gathered curious eyes from pensioners.
The host and Ms. Shirly Karvinen reported on the Red mat of the Miss Finland final that she had enough to do with radio drinks and Love Island Finland photos.
The urgency has been enough even to the extent that Karvinen arrived at the finale directly from the Finnair flight.
I made makeup and I put my hair on the plane.
This is the glamour.
At home, Karvinen laughs.
According to Karvinen, he drew his makeup out among the pensioners.
His preparation also attracted the attention of fellow passengers.
I had a big mirror and I saw people's eyes in the mirror.
My makeup was fun, at least for the rest of us.
He's flying to Spain once a week.
He spends about a few days at a time in Marbella.
Karvinen reports that he has enjoyed his laundry as the host of Love Island Finland.
He also describes his experience as stopping so far.
Karvinen tells me he went to see the singles on Friday.
It's kind of really raw.
They're people's true feelings, and Karvinen describes the individual feelings of the program.
How am I gonna put on my over-generation boots?
Three Perfect Examples
Classical garments are garments that operate from season to season in a dress rather than in a dress.
Often the classics are decades old, but sometimes even the most modern ones.
A few years ago, the over-generation boots that rose into the winter and autumn season have not gone anywhere.
In accordance with their names, boots that reach over the knee are repeated in style from year to year.
The visible boots share the views of the users, but the brave model should be tried, well - bravely.
Because overgeneration boots are actually suitable for any outfit.
Whether it's a tail, a lace, a tad, or a trico, the simple leather or artificial surface of boots works.
Long boots look good both in the festivities and in the costumes.
Black over-generation boots are also suitable for delicate outfits.
They properly balance the femininity of a pink, flowery plum and a soft, mute knitted thread.
Fresh but autumn-style everyday dress for romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro-intelligent outfit is produced by a long copper-brown velvet dress, over-generation boots, visible earrings and a rivet bag.
Although the overgeneration boots have a certain fineness, they also perfectly fit in the everyday mouth with a t-shirt, long shorts and trendy hat.
It's so easy, and yet it's so elegant!
Two robotic cars start operating in Espoo
They operate for the rest of the year and take passengers on board, the City of Espoo informs us.
Otaniemi’s robotic cars play a role as a bus simulator, as next spring the area will be launched by a robotic bus.
The project develops and pilots robotic vehicle traffic throughout the year and tests the technical performance of vehicles under Finnish conditions.
The experiment will find out how the robotic cars are doing on the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robotic bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says Johanna Nyberg, traffic manager.
For the first time robotic cars are running completely automatically between other traffic without special transport arrangements.
The safety of vehicles is always borne by a passenger on board.
Vehicles are constantly detecting their environment with several different sensors and assessing whether the roadway is open.
If not, they will interpret whether an obstacle has been detected to the vehicle, bicycle or snowflake, for example, says Harri Santamala, Managing Director of Sensible 4 for the development of robotic traffic.
Robot cars run throughout the autumn on three days a week: Tuesdays 13-15:30, Wednesdays 10-15 and Thursdays 10-15.
Robot cars stop at six stops along the route and take passengers on board.
The robotic cars' stops are identified by the stop markings.
The safest way to get there is the number 1.
Mokoma group bassist fell off the stage in the middle of the show and got hurt.
The Mokoma Group informs us of the unexpected situation on its Facebook pages at the Tampere Pakkaroom gig.
The Mokoma Group gig in Tampere Pakkaroom received a dramatic turn on Saturday when the band bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell from the stage in the middle of the performance.
It happened when the band was pulling the last song of the night.
The spider wrist broke.
The band informs you on its Facebook page.
"I'm in the spirit!"
Last night, Santtu tripped off the stage in the last song and broke her wrist.
Let's hope for a quick recovery for the metal brother!
The rest of the tour will take care of backup, read on the pages.
Mokoman's fans respond with concern to a photo update where the bassist-Santtu lies with the gypsum in his hand on the bed.
This news has been expected, it was quite a concern to see how bad it was.
The relief is great, the bones will heal with good time.
Chests and rapid recovery for Santu and good follow-up for the rest of the band plus the tour!
And thank you for yesterday's great job, but you promise to leave such a powerful drama from the end of the gigs, don't you?
Police were monitoring hunting in North Karelia and Savo.
The police department of Eastern Finland carried out hunting inspections on Fridays and Saturdays with Metsähallitus and Finland's game centre in North Karelia and Upper Savo, and police union officers reported on social media on Saturday.
The main focus of the surveillance was on the legality and license of hunting.
A hunting card was checked for each hunter and a hunting permit required by the state.
In addition, licences for the possession of hunting weapons and the authorised quantities of self-loading weapons used for channelling were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the inspection and only one hunter was met during the inspection and no required hunting permit was required.
The hunter was ordered to pay 12 daily daily fines for unauthorized catches.
In addition, 133 vehicle drivers were blown by the police, and two of them are suspected of drinking the wheel.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic offences during the fine procedure, for once.
To sum up, hunters are very good at the promise of hunting.
Many hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
A hunter noted that "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years, and this was the first time someone checked the permits".
The police department of Eastern Finland will continue to control hunting in autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
Mikenne leaves for Turkey to monitor the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of Interior Kai Mikkonen (alias) travels to Turkey in the next few days to monitor the selection of quota refugees to Finland.
It has been decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps to Finland this year.
Selection visits are usually made a couple of times a year, involving representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy and the police.
The delegation is already conducting interviews in Turkey.
The UN Refugee Organisation UNHCR first selects people with a particular vulnerability.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be particularly vulnerable to refugee camps, such as single-parent families, disabled people and sick persons, women and children.
More people are being chosen for the future group in Finland than there are in the quota, because in practice some people are not arriving for different reasons.
A silent approach also exists to NGOs operating at the borders of the Turkish Minister for the Interior, Syleyman Soylu and Syria.
Ilkka Salmi, Head of Office of the Ministry of Interior, is also on the trip.
Speaking of raising the quota
Finland has taken quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, there have been 750 refugees per year.
The quota was 1 050 a year for a couple of years, but no agreement has been reached in the government since then on raising it.
The meeting has supported the increase in the quota, but the project has recently fallen into opposition to the blue.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) recently proposed a gradual increase of the quota to 1 500 to 2 000 people per year.
A silent visit will be the first in this term, which the Minister for the Interior will take over to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The previous Home Affairs Ministers Petteri Orpo (above) and Paula Risikko (above) were able to move to their new positions before the visits could be arranged.
Finland receives EUR 10 000 from the EU for each particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now we're going to go to the hacks... no longer know if you're crying or laughing.
Last Saturday, the shepherd reported on a bill to amend the Animal Protection Act.
The article took the view that the draft law in principle prohibits all animals from being kept as farm animals, pets or otherwise as regards business activities which are not specifically authorised by the regulations of the ministries.
In other words, everything else is essentially prohibited except the animals mentioned in the regulation.
If the bill comes to an end, then it would mean that we are rejecting in Western democracies the general principle that the law specifically prohibits action that endangers the safety of society or good practice.
There is now a basic provision for banning all activities to which the law or regulation does not expressly permit.
The change is due to the fact that nothing new can be tested, for example, in the field of business, and nothing else can be done until it has been adopted by law or regulation.
The government's work in drafting legislation in general has been weak.
If we now get on the road to the fact that everything in Finland is prohibited in principle, which is not allowed separately, we will no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that the Animal Protection Act would not require an update.
But a law project this way is not a democratic project.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but I wonder if it will accept such a 'all things are prohibited' procedure, which is not explicitly allowed by law or regulation.
I hope there is a reasonable minister who will interrupt the progress of such a legislative project.
Meti Forssell Tip: 4 most trendy skirts in the fall
This autumn's trendy dress will come in snakes.
It looks particularly good in skirts.
Combine a snake-shaped skirt to a pair of more controlled upper parts, such as a pole or a regular T-shirt, so that the outfit remains elegant.
This autumn silk will be seen in plenty, and especially silk skirt will be one of the most trendy pieces of clothing in the season.
Connect a beautiful silk skirt with a women’s upper part or relax as a pair of sts.
You can play with Silkhame more bravely and throw on your feet such as sneakers or spring trendy boots.
It doesn't matter whether it's gray, brown, or multi-coloured, all square-shaped skirts now belong to every woman's black have-suit.
Have courage to connect different colors and play with the grid line on the upper part of the screen.
For example, the combination of the square root and the vulture is beautiful.
Unsymmetric beads are a breeze of the lightness of the summer, which can be taken with them to the autumn.
At the same time, the asymmetrical bead is feminine and playful and well suited for both the everyday and the feast.
Baby Alexia, three months, squeals sweetly in Jere's arms
In the family picture of Karalahs, a sweet three-month child named Alexia comes to the center of attention.
Nanna Karahti tells us about the authentic day care centre that was established for Kerava.
Nanna Karahti, the gymnast, 30, and the ex-Jerne hockey player Jere Karahti, 43, received a family allowance at the beginning of July.
The couple’s firstborn Jax boy was two years old in May, while little Alexia is only a three - month - old baby.
Nanna Karahti recently held training camps with Martina authentic magazine in Marbella, Spain, where the entire Karalahhti family was involved.
Nanna published on Instagram a picture of the Spanish atmosphere, where she poses the entire Karalahe family.
The children Jax and Alex are in their parents' arms.
Attention is drawn to the sweetly masquerading child Alexia, who rests on the arms of the father of Jere.
Thank you for this.
Thank you for your goodness, forgiveness, people's generosity and joy, writes Nanna Karahti next to the family pot.
The fitness journals programme was published by Nanna Karahti and the ex-ice hockey player, Jere Karahti, who recently left for day care and opened the authentic day care centre for Kerava.
In addition to Karalahhti, the company includes a food expert, Johannes Laine, and Hanna Liisanant, responsible for the education side.
Johanna Tervo was hired as head of the day care centre.
Turkey calls for mobile phones to be loaded in case of a storm
The Zorba storm in Greece on Saturday is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
On Saturday, meteorologists especially warned the seamen, fishermen and farmers on the west coast of the country about the Greek storm, wrote CNN Türk.
The tropical storm is reported to be moving along the coast from south to north during the day.
The disaster and emergency authorities called on citizens from the beginning on Saturday night to download their mobile phone before the storm and ensure the functioning of the Internet so that people could receive current updates of the situation, reports Anadolu Ajansi local news office.
People have been urged to stay at home and away from windows and to move garden furniture, for example, out of the wind.
Turkey is expected to have heavy rain and the wind is expected to blow within 28-33 meters per second.
In Greece, red weather warning
On Saturday, the Greek Air Science Service issued a red weather warning for the regions of the South Greek Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian islands, Kykladi and Crete.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and travel agencies in Greece warned the Finns in Greece about the Zorba storm.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens also published a storm warning.
Travellers were invited to follow the weather information and local authorities' instructions.
A little while ago, when I got in touch, there was a lot of wind and rain.
People were very calm, and Laura Aaltonen from the Tui travel agency told the STT on Saturday.
Aaltonen described the situation as similar on Saturday night.
By the end of the evening, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not received any messages from Finns in distress.
In several ports in Greece, ships did not operate on Saturday, reported the local news office Amna.
The boat trips to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, reported from travel agencies to the STT.
According to the Finnish Athenian mission, temporary disruptions to air and shipping were expected.
Finnair reported on Saturday that the weather situation was actively monitored.
Kimi Räikkönen crystallized the reason that Mercedes was better than Ferrari.
Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen admitted that the worst competitor Mercedes was too hard a piece of Russian gp's time.
However, there is no reason to sink into the panic in the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver estimates.
They were just faster than us, but nothing huge is going on.
Our car was best at times throughout the weekend for now, but they were just too fast, for the fourth time, and Räikkönen, who was clearly left at Mercedes speed with his stable partner Sebastian Vettel, said.
Ferrari was having a hard time in the last race in Singapore.
They asked what caused the sudden fall of the Mercedes ride.
They seem to be going faster than we are, so simple it is.
If I knew why, we'd probably go as fast as they did.
But I don't know any more than anyone else.
This is always a guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
A rare treat was seen at times for Räikkönen’s coming stable sauber.
In the first period of Ferrari’s replacement Charles Leclerc was the seventh, and the final time drive also reached Marcus Ericsson.
For Swedish drivers, the 10th place of departure is best for more than three years.
And even though at least five drivers were completely undriving in the second carriage, the result was still delicious for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging to Räikkös in the light of the future?
Yes, if you compare them to where they were from the early days, then the step forward has been great.
There's a different story next year, so let's see.
It was there - Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper, "Robbe is back"
The match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper during Stuttgart's evening advanced in even terms.
The German was a more initiativeal party in the ring, but he didn't get a good shot.
Clearly, the far-reaching Helenius controls the match with his hard-core series that found it well.
The Finnish was also in a much better physical condition than Teper.
The solution eventually came in the eighth round when Helenius knocked Teper with his left straight.
The hit was so hard that the conkar in front of the home audience didn't even try to get out of the carpet.
After the victory was confirmed, Helenius vented rather moderately.
At the interview, he first praised the public’s good atmosphere and his opponent.
Then he changed Finnish for a moment.
Thank you to all the viewers and Finnish encouragementers.
We took the belt with us today.
Helenius was happy right after the fight.
It was a huge victory for Helenius's career.
We might have a chance to even get to the World Cup, and Helenius commented on the Evening magazine before the match.
Instead, the loss might have ended the whole boxing career.
Of course it's crossed my mind.
There will be no younger, 34-year-old Helenius admitted before the Teper encounter.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster may be multiplied
According to The Guardian magazine, the Vice President of the country is calling for a clear increase in the number of victims.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims may rise to thousands.
Severe conditions
Saviours are looking for the trapped persons as well as the dead in the worst affected areas of the island of Sulawes: Please, port city and its neighbouring region, Dongala.
So far, all victims are from Palu; the situation in Donggala is not yet clear.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 are badly injured.
There are still people in the collapsed buildings that the saviors have not been able to get out.
For example, Roa Roa Hotel Palu has fallen.
Saviours report that they have heard the screams of people trapped in ruins, but the lack of purgatory equipment has delayed the beginning of the rescues.
The Indonesian President, Mr. Widodo, has assigned the army to rescue and deportation.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, as electricity and telecommunications connections in the disaster area are often cut apart.
Fuel reserves are also running out.
Miss Finland finalist's hesitateing response and long reflection caused a laugh.
In Ruuk, we're currently choosing a new Miss Finland.
During the interview, a question was asked to each of the miscifinalists.
The finalists asked about the glass bowl on the stage.
In particular, the finalist number six Emilia Anttikoski, 23, was the occasion of sweet but well-meaning laughter in the audience who was present.
The question to annotate had come through Facebook.
The user, Pirkko-Ella, wanted to know what the last book that the missionary has read was.
Anttikoski thought about his answer well before he began to hesitate.
Thank you for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read is... Anttikoski said, thinking.
The thought break in the audience caused a laugh until Anttikoski continued his response:
The last book I've read is...
I've read books in school!
Something to do with economics, I'm sure.
So the last book I've read is someone in economics, Anttikoski answered.
After his reply, Anttikoski received a lot of applause from the audience, laughtered.
Earlier, on the missionary tour, Anttikoski attracted attention because he did not want to pose in underwear because of his principle.
Miss Finland 2018 will be crowned at 21.00 when the crown is abandoned last year by Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm.
Sikke's apple pear cake takes the tongue away
This recipe is for you who have good, acidified apples from behind, because the domestic apple is in the store at shocking prices.
You might have to buy pears, although I think it's quite a bit of an increase in pear trees.
This cake can only be made for apples if you do not want to buy pears.
Of course, the taste is more diverse if the cake also has its pear.
Chest apples and pears and remove seeds.
Cut.
You can melt in the boiler.
Turn the eggs and sugar into foam and then add the corn flour to the foam and melt butter.
Combine the corn starch, i.e. maizena and bread powder and add also to the butter.
Add almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
A line of bread loaf with bakery paper, scour 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the flow and spread pear slices over the sugar.
Locked half of the butter on top of the pear slices and the apple blocks on top of the dough.
He puts the rest of the dough over the apple blocks.
Bake in the oven at 180 degrees for about an hour until the surface is beautiful brown.
Just let it cool down in the latte and then cancel it for the ranger.
Just cut the cake cooled down.
The cake is fragile in its structure and is easily crushed, as there are almond and maize flours in the pastry, which do not contain gluten.

Status symbols do not attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic, or admirable?
Researchers at the University of Sydney have outlined two types of "coolity" of slightly different characteristics: commonly attractive coolity and, to that end, the opposite dissident-cool.
Attractively, the people of the cool, according to the descriptions of the researchers, had many socially desirable features: they were outward, friendly, friendly, and competent.
The dissidents, on the other hand, had a typical distance, independence, insurgency, and pain.
They thirsted for experiences and cared little for external assessments.
Both types were combined with good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of hardness is not longer than cool: a high status in teen age may not lead to success later in life.
This is what the US survey published in the Child Development magazine in 2014.
Young people who were dating early, partyed, applied for good - looking groups and sought favor with others, grew the risk of using drugs when they were young and leading to crimes.
In their human relations, they were less able to cope than their more unseen peers at one time.
The lock that sends a high-level status is not gonna make a person cool, or at least truly attractive company.
In a study published in the Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, most of the people were more ready to be friends with their usual market shirt than with those wearing their shirts, despite the fact that most of them chose a brand shirt when they were introduced.
If you're on the island of Greece, be careful!
There's going to be a storm in there, a weather warning from the reds.
During the weekend, in southern Greece, it can rain as much water as in Finland over an average of six months.
The storm of Zorbas will strike Greece during the weekend.
Take care if you are in the area of Peloponnese, Ionian islands, Kyklate, or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy of Athens reports it on its Facebook pages.
According to the Embassy, the Greek Air Science Service has given the regions a red weather warning.
The approaching storm is also reported in Foreca's blog.
According to it, the strongest hips of the storm are up to 45 meters per second.
Due to the comparison, Finland was hit by the Kussma storm blowing at its hardest at 31 meters per second.
According to the blog, however, the main concern of the Zorbas storm is not wind, but heavy rains.
A weekend in southern Greece can be more than 300 mm of water.
It is responsible for about half the annual amount of rain in Finland.
Weather Service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the development of the storm on its Facebook site.
The Zorbas storm has caused floods this week in Tunisia and Libya.
Do you recognize Love Island Finland?
Appears with confusing YouTube videos
It is rare to know that in the Love Island Finland series, the beautiful Anku by several men also appears on strange YouTube videos published in 2010.
In the videos, Anku advises artisans, among other things, to make blueberry from an old economic paper roll.
The duck also shows its nice style, how you can wear stockings with an ascarred silk, with the right spikes growing.
Now we're gonna make Easter grass grow, but we're gonna do it a little bit of a surprise, Anku's gonna tip off and show us sawdust, pantyhose, and raccoon seeds from which he's gonna make a silk.
You can watch videos from underneath or from the Anku YouTube channel here.
Master Bottas shaked and burst the adrenaline in Sotsh? Will he be helped by Hamilton on Sunday?
A few minutes later, Mr. Bottas was shaking in front of the media after his gp pole drive in Russia.
The great round left behind Lewis Hamilton, the first star of Mercedes, and was certainly a critical criticism for the Finnish driver who was gathering this season.
Nice tour.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left the round of decisions.
I feel good, I'm still shaking, Bottas figured it out.
I have only been on the stake once this year in Austria (in the middle), so time has passed quite the way.
This track has been good to me before, and I got some good rounds again.
It is not easy to pass the Soth track, so the start is particularly large.
And of course, Bottas was able to answer the question of whether he's going to win tomorrow or whether he's going to be in front of the MM title on the coming Hamilton Jeesa.
My starting point for the race is definitely that I'm trying to win.
There can be no other goal when you leave the pole, Bottas did.
But as stables, we fight both championships.
Lewis's leadership at Sebastian Vettet is pretty big, and the difference between me is very big, so I'll keep that in mind.
Let's see what happens, but Bottas did.
Hamilton was really happy about Bottaks' success after driving, and what we saw in the Mercedes stable boss Toto Wolffi was good.
Lewis had a plan to win the Valter, but he didn't make it to the ground.
Master knows he'll have to tear everything from himself to win Lewis.
And he was so charged that adrenaline burst out of his ears, Wolff glowed.
To ask whether the stable lets Bottaks and Hamilton drive honestly, Wolff answered unexpectedly.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
Kiteläinen Erno Kinnunen reached the Finnish Championship
The SM series of rallying ended rarely.
I don't think the brothers have ever ended up being Finnish champions at the same time.
Now it was done in the final rally around Turku and Salo by the Tuusulas Eerik and Henrik St Petersburgen, as Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 classes.
Kiteläinen Erno Kinnunen confirmed the best achievement of his career when the third place in the final competition sealed him from the SM4 category of two-wheeled cars in the Finnish championship.
In Honda Civic, Kinnunen and the map reader Ville Mäkelä started the Turku semi-competition because the starting points were clear: the investment in the top group would guarantee the SM title.
In the dark of Friday night, the twin had to give a levelling when some of the additional lights failed with another special test.
It's got to be a little blind in it. It's a third bit.
In a situation like that, I don't think it's appropriate to be snotty.
On Saturday only the second series followed the speed of Jussi Tepo, Kinnunen told me.
Syria requires the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops
The Syrian Foreign Minister calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
At the UN General Assembly on Saturday, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem says that foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
Mullem said that foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and that war on terrorists is "nearly over", according to him.
In his UN speech Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to their country of origin.
But there is no end to seven years of war.
More than 360 000 people have died in the war.
On Friday, Chancellor Angela Merkel told Germany that a meeting with the Presidents of France, Russia and Turkey will be scheduled for October.
Not quite Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court Judge's Drama on TV.
The Supreme Courtable Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, received an exceptional number of people on the screens.
In the United States, at least 20 million people were given the full - power justice title drama on Thursday.
At that time Donald Trump, Kavanaugh and Californian professor Blasay Ford, accused of harassment, were in front of the Senate Justice Committee to tell his story.
According to the preliminary findings, the consultations were followed by six main channels, namely ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC, with a total of 20.4 million viewers.
In addition to their online consultation, several millions more followed.
NBC reported that 6,8 million people followed the livesters, and CNN reported that it had made its annual record of 8.2 million on the launch of the livelers.
CNN's number will rise to over 10 million as you count those following the shipment through YouTube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital was also able to launch 8.0 million.
Digital startups are the channels' own, TV viewers are from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen publishes the final readings on Monday, but they are still dizzy.
Few to 20 million
More than 20 million viewers in the United States usually only have sports matches, the great Oscars and Grammys of the entertainment world as well as occasional political events such as the presidential speeches and 2016 presidential elections.
Of course, there's a trip to the American football league's final game at the Super Bowl.
This year, around the screens, Super Bowl gathered about 103 million people on NBC.
Last year Trump's first speech to the Congress, Nielsen said that there were a total of approximately 48 million people and 30 million decent people on duty.
It's a very important matter.
The appointment of the Supreme Court of Justice in the United States is an extremely important case, since the offices are of life.
Trump was already able to appoint one new judge when Antonin Scalia died in early 2016 and the Republicans managed to prevent the then President Barack Obama from appointing a successor to him.
The second place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced that he would retire this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but on several issues he was a so-called "wait tongue" whose voice could have resolved the position of the nine-person court.
He was in favour of abortion law and the rights of sexual minorities and, for example, in 2015 he decided, with his voice, that same-sex people received marriage rights throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative than its positions.
His choice to the Supreme Court may be blocked for decades by the right to conservative supremacy.
Children have the right to know their parents
Only parents of children under 10 years of age can see health information about their children from the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
The situation of the Kanta service was, of course, even more worrying: the parents could not even look at the health data or recipes of young people.
A temporary correction was introduced in autumn 2016 for persons under 10 years of age.
Since then, the practice has been promised to be corrected, but it has been an amazingly long time.
Now the repair is promised - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, the change of the legal basis should not have been more than a call for proposals.
After that, the understanding of the layman is about pressing the button: now that the hold is held, let's open it.
Of course, a child can show his or her parents what he or she knows if he or she has a bank ID or an official ID card.
But how many ten-year-olds do you have?
The ID card is paid, and the ten-year-olds don't even get bank IDs.
So the fourth grade information in the secondary school is practically not available to anyone except by asking for it printed.
It is not so much about parents' rights as about children's rights.
It is extremely important for parents to be involved in the care of the child.
Of course, the right of teenagers to privacy must be ensured.
Even minors can have family situations where all things cannot be discussed freely.
Often they are related to sexual health, from which free care is deeply relevant to human rights.
In the United States, the FBI has initiated the prosecutions against Kavanaugh.
According to US media, the FBI is investigating at least two women's harassment charges.
One of the women was earlier this week at the hearing of the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs.
Kavanaugh has denied the accusations of alleged sexual harassment during his studies.
U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate charges at the request of the Senate Committee on Justice.
The investigation should not take longer than one week.
According to Washington Post, this is a criminal investigation of a more limited investigation, and it may not be published.
He threatened to kill police officers at the police station in Kajaan.
The attached rapist continued to bulge with the chamber.
The police say they put a man in a police prison to "save down."
The police were threatened by a suspected assailant on Saturday night in Kajaan.
The official informs us of the case that was started when a good 30-year-old man challenged violently at the central restaurant.
He first assaulted another client inside the nutrition store.
This resulted in the removal from the restaurant.
Outside, a fighter attacked another man by pouring him into the ground.
When the third party intervened, the man hit him, too.
Triangulation led to a police call.
The patrol picked up the man and took Kajaan to the police station, the police will tell us.
The suspect was still aggressive at the police station.
He kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault the police.
The police say they've sent a man to a police prison to "save down."
He's suspected of three assaults and a violent opposition by an official.
Aid organisations are preparing to start their work at Indonesian Sulawes, "The Clean Water is the most urgent"
United Nations Children's Organization Unicef and other international relief organisations are ready to help in Indonesia's island of Sulawes, says Kirsi Haru, Head of Information at Unicef in Finland.
Local authorities are in charge of rescues, but the need for additional assistance is already evident at this stage.
Unicef works in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programs in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, Unicef always has full emergency response, says Haru.
The first task is now to find people in the ruins, both the survivors and the dead.
I ask the city of Sulawes for rescue measures are in progress, but the situation in the Donggala region is somewhat more unclear.
There are still places where connections do not work.
The aid measures are difficult because the roads are also broken, says Haru.
The buildings in Sulawes are often light-structured, so the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami is great.
Once the survivors have been found, they need protection at first, for example tents and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
For the first time in humans, it is often possible to provide water-cleaning tablets that Unicef also has in storage.
Water systems are intended to be repaired as soon as possible, but in the event of an emergency, water is first transported by trucks, for example.
In times of crisis, many children are separated from their parents.
The search for family members and family reunification are part of Unicef's field of activity.
Food aid is organised by the World Food Programme (WFP) as part of the UN.
In the initial phase, emergency aid will be used in the past.
But, among other things, Unicef has already started collecting money to help the victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami.
billionaire Elon Musk, as Chairman of the Tesla Board, will end fines of $20 million for twitters
Elon Musk, founder of space rockets and electric cars, avoids fraud charges by agreement with the US Securities Commission.
billionaire Elon Musk will cease his duties as chairman of the Tesla Board of Electric Cars and will agree to a $20 million fine.
The Musk withdraws from this task as part of the contract he entered into with the US Securities Authority.
By agreeing with Musk to avoid fraud charges.
The US Securities Commission SEC threatened Musk against fraud because of the twites he sent in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing for Tesla to be withdrawn from the stock exchange by an electric car company, which led to a rapid increase in the company’s stock exchange rate.
According to the agreement, Musk must not preside over the Tesla Government for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new 'independent member' to its government and take two 'independent directors' to its board of directors.
Tesla must also set up a committee to monitor the communication of Musk.
The Musk is still allowed to continue as CEO of Tesla.
In addition to the personal 20 million dollar fines in Musk, the Tesla company also has to pay 20 million corresponding fines to the financial controller.
The Twists led investors astray.
According to the SEC, Muski's twitters mislead investors and Tesla shareholders.
Musk claimed that he would have secured the financing that Tesla would buy back from the stock exchange as a private limited company.
According to the billionaire's twitters, the company would have been purchased from the stock market for a partial development of $420.
The share price of Tesla rose by more than 10 per cent per day after the twitters, but declined later.
According to the SEC, Musk's claims had no basis at all.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated on the financing he claimed.
He had also not discussed the withdrawal of the stock exchange with the other management group or with the company’s Board of Directors.
On Friday this week, the course dropped by 14 per cent when the SEC reported fraud charges.
The new agreement is expected to strengthen the company's course again.
The Last Judgment Is No Reason
Of course, the clocks of the church do not ring when the wise men do not move.
It's a technical error.
The tower of the Helsinki Court Church has stopped.
The wise men will show you at 12 o'clock.
The situation is like a medium horror movie: even when the church crypt is a part of exorcism, and the organ would sound to itself.
Of course this is not the case, but the clock has stopped for technical reasons: it has gone broken.
It's been seen by the repairer, but some parts have gone broken and a new part is expected, says Suntio Eveliina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the fact that the Twitter account has already mentioned.
It is mentioned in the account that the last sentence is not a reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen says the church bells don't ring because of a mistake.
