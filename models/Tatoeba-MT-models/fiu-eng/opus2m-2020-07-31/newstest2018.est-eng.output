Four members of the Kemerovo Group were arrested in Estonia and Spain
According to the mailman, the police arrested the so-called Head of the Kemerovo Group in Spain, Slava Gulevich, who is known in the criminal realm under the name of Slava Kemerovski.
Gulevitch was arrested in Spain with the permission of the court.
Yesterday, the court also arrested three suspects in Estonia.
It is suspected that it is members of the so-called Kemerovo criminal community aged 27 to 57, who mainly commit drug crimes.
In Malaga Province, Spain, Mijas, the alleged leader of the criminal community was detained.
Three men were arrested in Estonia as suspects, one of which is reported to be the leader of the criminal community and two of which are members of the criminal community.
The data collected indicate that the roles and roles of the criminal in the Community were clearly distributed.
The aim of the criminal community’s action was to commit drug offences and thereby earn proceeds,” commented the head of the pre-trial proceedings, Public Prosecutor Vahur Verte.
"We do not rule out the increasing circle of suspects in this criminal case," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have also been in the custody of law enforcement agencies before, and some of them have been punished for drug crimes.
Mr Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us and this week's operation shows the success of the cooperation", commented prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, head of the Central Criminal Police Department, said that the arrests were preceded by an investigation of about a year and a half.
"In the first half of the week, long-term work was realised and at the same time, we respected suspects in crimes in Estonia and Spain," he said.
He added that officials of the Central Criminal Police helped to keep Spain in custody.
For years now, we have a good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the civilian guard.
These detentions are another message for criminals to catch them from the other end of Europe," said Leis.
The information collected so far clearly indicates that, while in freedom, suspected men may continue to commit new crimes, and the prosecution sought their arrest and the court also approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is awaiting his surrender to Estonia.
As part of this criminal case, real estate, vehicles and cash are seized to ensure confiscation.
The pre-trial proceedings in criminal matters are conducted by the Central Criminal Police Office for Organized Crimes and led by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
In 2005, the City Court of Tallinn sentenced Slava Gulevich to extortion and punished him with a five-year imprisonment.
In the middle of the previous decade, Gulevich was considered to be the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world following the then underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevitch, from Kemerovo, emerged in the underworld of Estonia in the early 1990s when he began to deal with blackmail in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes who worked at various hotels and charged businessmen a monthly roof tax.
International joint operations, confiscations of proceeds of crime and in force judgments confirm that the fight in the field of organised crime is effective.
For example, recent convictions, the eight accused persons from the criminal case of the so-called Dikayev criminal community, who were confiscated from EUR 80 000, or nine against the fact that Igor Aleynikov created a criminal community in 2006 aimed at the illicit trafficking of secret cigarettes and the committing of crimes related to trafficking in human beings in eastern Estonia and southern Estonia.
The amount of seized criminal income there is around EUR 71 500.
In these criminal cases, success has been ensured by the daily exchange of information and evidence by the prosecutors with foreign officers and, if necessary, by the action taken together in any country of the European Union.
The Civil Rights Group warns of travelling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned the black people travelling to Missouri against the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement states: "The NAACP travel note for the State of Missouri, valid until 28 August 2017, invites all African-American passengers, visitors and missours to be particularly careful and extremely careful when moving around the state, taking into account the suspicious racial-based events of the entire race that have recently taken place across the state and have been listed here."
According to the NAACP, the group was encouraged to issue a travel warning, both in the recent Missouri Act, which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination, and also in the fact that the targets of the state's lawkeepers are, to a large extent, very much, minorities.
People's civil rights are being violated.
They are drawn to the edge of the road due to their skin color, they are beaten or killed," said NAACP Missouri branch president Rod Chapel to the Kansas City Star newspaper.
"We've never had a complaint that close."
This is the first such warning issued by the organisation for the state of the United States.
The group referred to events such as racist insults to black students at Missouri University and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died at the beginning of this year in suspicious circumstances after he ran out of gas, and Missouri police arrested him without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the remark refers to a recent report by the Chief Prosecutor of Missouri, which shows that black drivers are being stopped in the state at 75% more likely than white drivers.
"The note is meant to make people aware and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People must be ready, whether it means taking bail money or informing relatives that they are going through the state."
On the basis of the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting programme, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, which, in terms of the number of similar violations of the State, will be placed in the 16th section of the State.
The travel warning is also in response to the new law of Missouri, which makes it more difficult for the company to appeal to the court in search of housing or work for discrimination.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel notes on Texas and Arizona after these states adopted immigration laws which obliged local people to be arrested for immigration violations because, according to the ACLU, this increases racial profiling.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is generally issuing travel warnings for other countries, but stakeholders have recently begun to use this measure as a countermeasure to certain laws and trends within the US.
Hepatitis: What would anyone know about the various forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver, may be caused by five different hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D and E.
All these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C, which may develop further into cirrhosis of the liver, i.e. liver and liver cancer, are at low cost.
The health department’s epidemiological advisor, Kutsar, says that the signs of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of hepatitis - fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, grey stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowing of the skin and mucosa.
The last sign of disease also comes from a common name of hepatitis.
In children, hepatitis may develop without signs or symptoms.
The different types of inflammation of the liver can only be determined from laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis can be converted to chronic hepatitis and run for decades without symptoms, which means that you may not know anything about your dangerous liver disease.
Kutsar of Hallo shows different forms of hepatitis and describes their course in greater detail.
The hepatitis viruses spread from a sick person to an infected person and infect us by eating or drinking contaminated food, by sex, from infected person to food, by surfaces, by objects, by mouth, and by drug use.
The risk group for hepatitis infection includes family members and carers of the affected person, people with chronic liver disease, people having sex with the infected person, men having sex with men, drug addicts, passengers visiting high levels of hepatitis A.
The infection can be prevented by vaccinations, in particular for people with a high risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to meet the daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands, wash all fruit and vegetables before being used for food.
The hepatitis B viruses spread when exposed to human blood, when injecting drugs, tattooing, Augusting, using blood-contaminated clots (toothbrushes, shavers), donor blood, the person suspected of having sex with a hepatitis and the patient with hepatitis from the mother to the foetus/ newborn.
The risk group for hepatitis B includes injecting drug addicts, sex partners of infected human beings, male sexes, newborns of infected mothers, sick family members and carers, health care professionals, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other body fluids, and passengers visiting countries with high hepatitis B disease.
In order to prevent hepatitis B, it is possible to vaccinate people; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate those at risk, as well as those with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other measures to prevent hepatitis B include: avoiding the use, tattooing and cutting of foreign hygiene and manicure devices, other sharps and injection needles, and the use of condoms in cases of infectious sex or prevention of sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation plan and for children free of charge.
The hepatitis C viruses spread when exposed to human blood, when injecting drugs, tattooing, Augusting, using blood-infected straws, donor blood, sex with a person suspected of having hepatitis, and from a mother to a foetus/son.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injecting drug addicts, sex partners of infected human beings, male sexes, newborns of infected mothers, sick family members and carers, healthcare, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other body fluids, HIV-infected persons, and passengers visiting countries with high hepatitis C disease.
The prevention measure for hepatitis C is: prevention of the use, tattooing and cutting of foreign hygiene and manicure products, other sharps and injection needles, and the use of condoms for infectious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
hepatitis D is caused by hepatitis D virus, which is multiplied by the presence of hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection occurs with hepatitis B or super-infection in chronic hepatitis B patients.
D hepatitis viruses spread in contact with blood and other body fluids, injection needles contaminated with them, sexually transmitted and rarely infected mothers to the foetus.
D The risk group for hepatitis B is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people who are not immune to hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects the person from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
E hepatitis viruses spread by fecal-oral route with drinking water and food, including low-cooked meat, fish and sea shells, donor blood, shared syringes and infected mothers.
Passengers may be infected with hepatitis E in countries with a high disease.
E The prevention measures for hepatitis are hygienic compliance: wash or disinfect hands after use in the toilet, before preparing and eating food, after caring for the patient.
Fruit and vegetables should be washed before consumption, low-cooked meat, fish and marine dishes should not be eaten, only drinking safe drinking water and avoiding drug use.
Although competitors tried to push four-time Olympic winners off the track on the last round, the 34-year-old Farah found power in the final valley and won 26.49.51.
Farah did not think for a long time, pulling his wife, Tania, and his children along with him after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
Being on the track with them was wonderful," Farah said to the journalists.
Farah is targeting the fifth title competition in London in a row of 5,000 and 10,000 meters of gold doubles.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor "Dam in Gold. Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait is an extraordinary story from the story of one of the works of art much deeper into the cultural life of Vienna at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century.
But even more in-depth history.
It would have been useful for an information set of honorables, that is to say, a tougher axe, a narrower subject, to let the extraordinary story of the portrait allowed in the title get a little bit more out of hand.
Today, it would be like two books between one cover: Gustav Klimt and the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer on his painting "Dam in Gold" and a much more comprehensive and comprehensive history book about respected Jewish families and German occupation, along with its subsequent effects in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to cultural life in the middle of Vienna and who himself has come to the capital of Austria, can hardly imagine how more than a hundred years ago life went around the Ringstrasse or how everyone turned their heads when Klimt stepped in at the central cafe.
The concentration of culturalists was high in one of Europe’s richest cities, and when you see the name familiar with the book, you feel more like a gram more culturally.
For example, the fact that Sigmund Freud was active in a city where there was an incurable syphilis and was the highest level of suicide in Europe, as if nothing was added to the development.
Or perhaps, too, every pair-worded brush pull adds colors to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
Dream of a journey to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews had exploded in Vienna, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
On the turn of the century, almost every ten inhabitants of Vienna were Jews.
Adele's parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married her twice to Ferdinand Bloch, the Czech sugar magnate, and Klimt, posed for her famous paintings, her father's bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adele's whole glamorous life, where she belonged, didn't.
If you look at "Dam's gold", it's hard to believe that this great lady from socialism has been infected in the end of her life and dreamed of traveling to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order a portrait of his husband from Klimt, he was the last hottest painter in Vienna.
Klimt’s order was then paid by 4000 kroons, a quarter of the price of a well-placed farm.
The fact that some portraits were suspected of having a master's love story with a model did not suppress the sugar magnet.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only sure fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist developed during the work continued for the rest of their lives.
Anne-Marie O'Connor, "Dam dear.
Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Buer's portrait extraordinary story", Varrak 2016, translated by Aldo Randmaa.
Right before work with Adele, Klimt had visited Ravennas San Vitale in the Basilica, and the researchers believe that the glorious Mosaics that were just seen there from Empress Theodoras gave the artist the idea to make a golden portrait of Adele as a painted mosaig.
Klimt presented his "Dam's Gold" in Vienna in 1908 and around the same time (in the years 1907-1908) was born in another golden painting "Sudulus".
Art historians did not miss the similarities of two women.
What about Hitler?
"I think I owe him the memory of my friend Klimt to make his handiwork available to the public," Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote a few years after the artist left (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wished that their family's Klimt collection would go to the museum.
Six years before his death, Adele had made another portrait of Klimt.
In his will (Adele left in February 1925), he also asked his wife to leave her two portraits and four Gustav Klimt landscapes on the Austrian Gallery.
His jewelry was passed on to Mary and Luis, his nieces.
A year after Klimt had graduated from "Austria Mona Lisa", he had tried to get to the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, 17-year-old Adolf Hitler, but failed his drawing exam.
Although Hitler’s subsequent anti-Semitism is sometimes considered to be the reason for not accepting him to the academy, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
In any case, the task of the Austrian Gallery, referred to in the will of Maria, had changed considerably by 1939: it had become important to find works for the Nazi parties in rich Jewish art collections in Vienna.
Hitler’s personal art wealth was also suitable for some of Adele’s work at home, but not for Klimt’s.
Sixty years after the Nazi art robbery, a ten-year trial started between the Austrian government and the heirs of the Bloch-Buer.
Here it should be noted that if "Struggle" is seen in the Belvedere Castle in Vienna, then Adele Bloch-Bauer's "Dam's Gold" must be seen in the New York Neue Galerie.
And before driving to Vienna, read also the book mentioned above.
Even when you're looking at Klimt's work, there's no plan, because at least my emotions turned after closing the book more Nazi and Jewish themes than the $135 million painting and model Adele Bloch-Buer around.
So not so much a portrait as the fate of the family story - and a very moving story.
Clearly, the Bauer family tree that was introduced at the beginning of the book facilitated the orientation of events.
17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
In the way of life, Gold had its own 200 m of back-swimming personal record, swimming very close to 2.16.62.
Tippmark dates back to the 17-year-old sistership since the time of 2.16,58 at the Canadian Junior Championships, Priit Avaru Uuumisblog.
Gold was the last to make it to the A-final in the tenth grade.
In the final he passed the distance by 2.15.76 and reached a good seventh place with a new powerful brand.
Alina Kendzior's Estonian record (2.15.13) left Gold a bit more than half a second apart.
Gold was the third in the ranking of all times, and its fresh personal top mark is the fifth result of all times in Estonia.
A young hope for the future is still starting at Canada's adult championships in 100 m, 200 m and 400 m, and in 200 m and 400 m complex swimming.
Last week, in Toronto, the Canadian Junior Championships took place, and Gold took a successful start there.
He won a 200-metre free-sum silver medal during the time of 2.03.22.
This distance was so rapidly flooded by the Estonian woman last in 2008.
More quickly than Gold, only Elina Partõka, Estonian record woman, has swimd this distance in Estonia.
The Estonian woman living in Canada won the Bronx Medal 100 m in a free mood with an excellent personal record and a new Estonian season top mark of 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, a year older, has only one century faster than this distance.
Up to the personal top mark, he arrived at another 100 m in the back swimming in the opening of the notification swimming in a letter of 1.03.69.
On half a distance, he only reached the seventh place when he was swimming in the finals of 2.17, 31.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season ranking on four different distances.
President Trump is on vacation, critics are shaking teeth.
It's time for vacations, which means relaxation for President Donald Trump of the United States.
However, since Trump has been one of the presidents who took off most days of vacation so far, critics are already shaking their teeth.
According to the U.S. Today and CNN, the president's plan is to spend a 17-day vacation at a golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the President's leave began yesterday, the anti-trump holiday has been taking the floor for weeks.
They're throwing Trump off too often.
It is the President’s custom to spend weekends in his villa in Florida, Virginia, and New Jersey.
By the way, Trump is not the most rested president in his 196 days.
For example, George W. Bush had already been on vacation for 67 days, while Barack Obama was half less than Trump, only 21 days.
However, Trump tends to forget things quickly.
The countless days after becoming president Trump said on the show "60 minutes" that there would be no time for a long vacation during his nurse's term, because there is a great deal to be done.
He also announced three years ago that he was upset about Barack Obama’s vacation.
The current president wrote on Twitter at the time: "When Obama is on vacation, plays golf, goes to parties and jazz concerts, the heads of ISIS journalists are cut off".
According to the White House officials, a 17-day golf club visit is not exactly a relaxation.
It is officially called a leave of employment, during which Trump does not have time for reading or other recreational activities.
In addition, there had to be another reason for the leave of employment.
The Western White House air conditioning system is being replaced and therefore all personnel had to leave it.
The Western wing also includes Ovalkabinet and other Presidential offices.
"I don't think any of you would like to be in the west wing in August if there's 38 degrees and no conditioner," said Lindsay Walters, White House speaker, who stressed that the president would continue to work during his vacation.
From where President Trump spends the next 17 days, you'll get a clue on the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook Do not apply to the state office if you cannot tolerate voters' criticism
Our country's father knew a lot about bad media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to start killing him for everything from internal politics to political principles.
The criticism, of course, upset him.
But he didn't make his critics remain silent.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "freedom of expression may be taken away from us, and by dark and quiet we may be led to slaughters like sheep."
It brings me to Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland, who has to work hard to be more like Washington.
Hogan subjects have blocked and deleted posts from at least 450 people who published their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And towards the beginning of the week he was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
The Governor's office stamped the action empty, and the web comets were full of counter-reactions in the style "Who cares?".
"It's just Facebook," said many.
But it does matter.
And that matters a lot when it comes to a man like Hogan.
This is an amazingly popular Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state.
His approval rate is right in the second place among the 50 governors of the state.
Hogan is not an unthinking snoophead.
He has led the state with a firm hand and remained firmly determined on his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook as the main tool for communicating with his voters rather well, for example, by showing his bald head since the first time in chemotherapy.
Thus, the Governor's paper, which is a public forum with an official label, is managed by the blocking of people visiting the taxpayers' dollars, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan's press representative Amelia Chase defended the conduct of the governor given to The Washington Post, claiming that blocking comments was nothing but moderating.
But it's too easy to paint a picture of Internet trolls, spam-posters, or people full of anger on the web.
The Post had a conversation with a number of real people Hogan blocked.
And that's exactly what they're real people who communicate with their chosen leaders. Teacher, company owner and pastor, not internet trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thought - out, and not depraved at all.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, under pressure from Hogan’s Catholicism.
A lawyer from Bowie, Maryland, Lakshmi, Sarma Ramani, did not incite anger, but rather actual hate crimes.
"I said politely that I am disappointed that he has not reacted to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote The Post's news story in the commentary state.
"I also do not like the idea that how many people comment on the same subject, some immediately call it a collective effort rather than admit that this is a great deal of concern for citizens."
What the governor's office called "directed spam attack" would probably be called "public support".
The Facebook era allows easy matching of messages by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the old days when workers had to be sent out to collect and burn newspapers with critical instructions or arrest protesters and force them to remain silent.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first state official to be criticised for toothing Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump has sued Twitter users who have blocked his Twitter stream.
One of the first judgments with a marked significance was made on this subject last week in Virginia.
In Alexandria, U.S. district judge James C. Caber, the chairman of the Loudoun County Supervisory Board, broke the first amendment to the Constitution when he blocked the voters from his Facebook page.
Kentucky also visited Governor Matt Bevin (R) for the use of ACLU Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington, affordable postal costs had a similar effect to the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers and anonymous writers quadrupled his mode of administration.
And even then, Washington had to breast-feed anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to the newspapers from pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius, making Washington’s decisions to lie down.
According to the historical documents collected in the framework of the web-based George Washington Letter Collection Project, he was buried under petitions criticising his views on friendship, trade and shipping agreements with the United Kingdom.
But he didn't make them remain silent.
Freedom of expression, differences of opinion and debate are the foundations of our country.
And right management means it's accepted.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for the comfort of his home territory at the Renaissance Club
The former European number Ronan Rafferty expects the comfort of the home territory within the next three days when 25 Scottish Senior Open takes place at the Renaissance Club golf courses in East Lothian.
The Northern Irishman, who was leading the last round before Paul Eales on the archerfield Link tracks in the neighbourhood last year, is fond of the new venue and performs the role of the tournament ambassador instead of Jerry Sarvad, the founder and CEO of the club.
"I saw the building of the Renaissance Club, and now we see the club glowing with this event in full glory," Rafferty said.
"Wanderers see the path in its best form, it is in a brilliant state.
Jerry has done an excellent job building this place.
He's a keen supporter of the golf game and he's proud of what he's achieved here.
This will allow the path to be presented perfectly."
An Englishman, Eales, looks forward to being able to protect the championship for the first time, although he has won both on the European Tour and on the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"This is what sends a very special feeling," said the player in Southport.
"I couldn't protect my Extremedura Open title, because it was taken away from my winning competition calendar a year later.
It's magical to come back to this place.
It's a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year, for me and my wife Sharon, last year's victory was special.
It was a very special time that we will always bear in the heart."
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour in the beginning of this year, will return to the competition again.
This is his first event in Scotland following the participation of Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"The home to play is always a little bit more meaningful," said Helensburgh's man, Orr.
"You want to perform well, but you also feel extra stress.
I've enjoyed playing again so much, and I've shown you a pretty good golf game.
I'm happy with the way things are."
The Trio will be joined by the former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and the senior tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scottishs in competition, and the rest are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free of charge, and parking a car with one passenger costs 5 pounds and 10 pounds for a car with two or more passengers.
All revenue goes to the charity Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in the gold-rich land of Indonesia
If Bardin makes dinner, he won't use the stove.
He doesn't even use the pot.
In the log house in Enarota, the Pania’s capital of Indonesia’s Province of Indonesia, the housewife places nota directly on the fire site in the local language of the housewife.
In half an hour, the coaled tuber is taken from the fire and injected with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the soil floor with no furniture, and there she also does her daily household work, such as washing laundry with cloudy water from the nearby sex.
The bucket plays a role in a room without the roof.
Since she is the youngest of four wives, she has not been assigned to care for any field.
Polygamy is common here.
Late work, however, can be dangerous for most of the men in the village who are unemployed and many of them drink hard, and there are soldiers.
"No one dares to go around after five o'clock in the evening," he says.
This is a rare look at life in the Highlands of Papua. It was the former Dutch colony, which was merged with Indonesia in 1969, and it created a referendum in which only 1026 elderly people were forced to vote by raising their hands in the eyes of the Octoberan troops.
The move, which encouraged the Dutch authorities to free themselves from power, towards their rage quickly against the Jakarta government, which continues to hold the region under its strong control by keeping the foreign journalists and human rights supervisors away.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua, so that the independent Papua New Guineae remained east of the island.
Enarotal is also a remote and abandoned place. To get here, you must fly 90 minutes from the capital of the province to Nabire from Jayapura and then go through a five-hour journey that makes you sick of a rental car.
There is no common transport.
The city with a population of about 19 000 is made up of wooden houses surrounded by Bamboo fences and covered by waved iron roofs, which roses have turned different shades of yellow brown.
Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, not to mention journalists, and there have been almost no foreigners.
Before the Christian missionaries arrived, Pope Mee Pago worshiped a god called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing clothes like this," says Degei, referring to his colour-pink hand-woven turban, dark shirt and bright skirt.
"before that, we carried only leaves of plants on the body."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and statistics on the mortality and illiteracy of infants are one of the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's golden land.
Just 100 km from Pania, a mountainous province about 153 000 inhabitants of New Jersey, is located in the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, which belongs to Freeport McMoran, a company operating in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined around USD 3.1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can be branded with consumer timber, which is estimated at USD 78 billion.
However, these riches are the source of the suffering of the popes, as they result in the stunned presence of the powerful Indonesian army.
A 2005 study in The New York Times showed that between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid around USD 20 million to local military and military units, including up to USD 150 000 to one officer.
Popes' efforts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden han and they are unloved.
According to human rights activists, more than 500 000 Popes have been killed since 1969, and thousands of others have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass killing in the mountains of the Papuase tribes in the 1970s was the measure of genocide.
Last year alone, over 3,900 peaceful protestors arrested in the Indonesian police area.
The 2016 "We all lose" report of the archbishop of Bisbane contains evidence of the brutalities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (one report says that rape and electric shocks are particularly common) and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of staff because such incidents take place every week," says Andreas Harsono, researcher at Human Rights Watch Indonesia.
The screws are even more shut down because the natural resources of Papua have caused the influx of newcomers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of 3.5 million people in the province are Christians, but demographics are changing, because Muslim economic migrants are coming from the Indonesian population, Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and the Sulawes islands.
Family food for the Javans sells gado-gado with crispy and mixed vegetables, served with peanut sauce.
Locals can't compete with them.
"Migrants began selling chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local papans," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old born in Panama, who moved to Jayapura, the capital of the province for work.
"The papaya-mama [women] will therefore lose their market share."
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, who is known as Jokowi, promised to deal with these inequalities and human rights violations in Papua in his 2014 election campaign.
On his way to Jakarta's presidential palace, the former carpenter won 27 of the Papua 29 constituency, including Pania.
But the Pope has changed very little and the locals feel disappointed.
"Our hearts are broken, because in 2014 we voted in favour of Jokowi in expectation that he will fulfill our hopes for the restoration of justice," says You.
In fact, only two months after Jokowi took office in October, Pania was understated.
On 7 December 2014, 11 children sang Christmas songs at Enarotali on fire when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on the motorcycle in the dark.
The children who were in contact told them to turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and later returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and witnesses, drunk soldiers chased children and beat them with their gun handles.
Then one of the soldiers shot the kids.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, a nearby election committee building was set on fire, and the next day things continued to deteriorate.
Approximately 1,000 young men, women, and children from Papua met for justice at the football field in front of the local police station and the military control center.
They wore ceremonial yachts and performed the waita dance of the Papua honey pago tribe, during which they ran around and copied the song of birds.
Some protestors began to throw stones at the police and the military.
In the event of aggravation of evil, soldiers were sent an order through an internal radio. "If the mass of the people points to opposition more than three times, shoot them," they said according to an official document, which has been seen by TIME magazine, but which has not been issued to local media.
The elder in Yeremias Kayame (56) in the city of Enarotal, Kego Koto, felt a threat and called for peace to be maintained by asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
"While turning around, I was suddenly shot at the left wrist," he told the magazine TIME in his bright colors on the treehouse porch.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but he says that the bullet came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers.
"There was a lot of people, a lot of shots came in," he adds.
The local man, Alfius Youw, was shot three times by a cousin who saw him shoot.
"I ran to him and searched his body to make sure it was him," said TIME to the magazine in dark Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... "I kissed him."
Pope Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told the reporters that he was only responsible for the security of his station because it was attacked.
"We must defend ourselves if we are threatened to be killed," said Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, a spokesperson of the Papua police in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protestors were killed and many injured.
The news of the killings came to Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, in Jokowi Jayapura, he gave a passionate speech in which he showed compassion to the families of the victims and promised to deal with the abuses that occurred in Papua.
"I want to solve this case right now, so it will never happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that he would establish an out-of-court mechanism to resolve crimes against human rights.
But almost immediately, there were excuses.
"Most crimes happened a long time ago.
Some occurred in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we must follow certain processes," he said.
When speaking to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June, Wiranto withdrew his words, saying that he had no intention of establishing a mechanism to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said "all is settled by law".
Wiranto, accused by the United Nations of crimes against human rights in connection with the death of more than 1000 people in East Timor during the 1999 bloody independence referendum, said that 11 crimes against human rights have already been resolved in Papua, including those in Panama.
The families of Pania’s victims accepted such claims with dark obscurity.
"I've been questioned four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made," said Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that Paniai people were afraid to solve this incident.
He said he was beaten by the army after he had helped bury four victims.
"After burying corpses, the army came looking for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot village residents at the Pania Neighbours Agency in Deiya.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, when the village residents and the manager of the construction company refused to transport a unconscious man to the hospital.
This man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, drowned in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested at the construction site in front of the company’s office.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at the policemen, after which they responded with a warning shot.
But according to the locals, the mobile Brigade (the Indonesian military police) started shooting at the people, killing one person.
"We were in a big panic, we fear revenge," said Time, 29-year-old Dominggu Badi, who lives near the hospital and saw the injured being brought in.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the police involved to be held accountable and the police mobile Brigade to be withdrawn from the region.
Pania has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of thought-out development feeds the dissatisfaction of the many tribes of Papua who live in the middle mountainous region, Dani and Damal.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (VPL), an army of rebels, which, according to him, defends the rights of the popes, causing random attacks and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers.
Some VPL leaders come from Panama, including Tadius Yog and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, the military, on the pretext of 'protection of the sovereignty of the state', has arrested in Panama over recent years and arbitraryly detained thousands of people.
Some of them never show up again.
Among the pope's people, Pania is known as a tragic forgotten place.
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarota is too expensive to buy for the locals.
The bread is just as unreachable.
People grow all their food themselves mainly in sweet potatoes, in addition to a little fruit and leaf vegetables.
Farm sacrifice is the work of women, each of whom is able to care for four or five sweet potatoes.
They usually hold most of their catches to the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten sweets only costs 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
In time, the economic inequality between indigenous paparazzi and new migrants, which have arrived many times since the opening of the new routes at Nabire airport.
The few jobs that exist are better for educated and more wealthy migrants.
Popes often lack capital or the necessary skills to conduct a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there is no jobs or money," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniani People's Council.
Independence keeps the world's eyes off the Pope.
In addition, severe restrictions on foreign media remain.
Towards the beginning of this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua because they were "not following the relevant practices", although they had been granted a rare film authorisation.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Head of the Human Rights Watchi Asia Department, the electoral promises to remove restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been implemented.
"In Indonesia, journalists trying to report from the eastern restless provinces of Papua and Western Papua are threatening to reject the visa and to enter a blacklist," he said in his statement.
The lack of a view of the press cage means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the neighboring neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states, Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands, encouraged the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate "a wide range of crimes" in the Pope, including the shooting of Pania.
The same countries have historically supported VPL.
Arrmanatha Nasir, a spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, dismissed the Group's accusations, saying to the journalists Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic order and freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to bury evidence of anti-human rights cases."
Local people want more foreign governments to be noticed.
When the Dutch official delegation headed the country's human rights ambassador, Kees Van Bari, visited Jayapura on 4 May, local people stopped at the meeting, but, according to the source who wanted to remain anonymous, asked for their silence, "We want freedom."
New presidential elections will take place in Indonesia in 2019, but Popes do not believe that they will again vote in favour of Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a well-meaning man, but he is surrounded by people involved in Pania's shooting," says Hobai, Chairman of the District Council.
He wants to make it clear to Jokowi that, apart from the fact that the people of Pania are constantly living under the threat of a predatory army, they suffer from severe education and health services in poverty.
According to Gobai, Pania’s people, like the other popes, consider their voice to be a debt to Jokowi that he needs to repay.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of Pania’s shooting victims were still able to cope with the last symbolic counterattack they buried one of the victims’ corpses in a country opposite the police station and the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be set on foot, they at least let those responsible forget their crimes.
"One of our family was killed," says Yacobus with his head down.
"What else can we do?"
The fire swallowed up a Dubai Torch skyscraper for the second time.
On Friday, the fire pushed through one of the world's highest residential towers in Dubai, making hundreds of inhabitants escape from this 337-metre building and 79-storey building.
It's another fire that's ruined the high building in just two years, which is called the Torch, or Torch.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct cause of fire was reported.
"We slept and woke up at the fire alarm and yelling at people.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down the 50th floor," said Reuters, a resident who called himself George.
According to Dubai Civil Protection Officers, firefighters wiped out the flame at about 4 a.m. in the morning at local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working to provide shelter for the victims.
This incident may once again raise questions about the safety of materials used throughout the world on the external surface of high-level plants.
The investigation carried out by the presidency after the 2015 fire found that the most damage suffered by fascists - external decorative panels and isolation.
The British police have said that they believe that the Grenfell Tower isolation and the fascist panels in London could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire in June, which killed some 80 people.
See, these phones are probably gonna be sales buildings in the fall.
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for tech fans, because then telephone manufacturers will disclose their new top models.
In the spring came Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium, also in the autumn expected new hit-telephones.
According to TV2 marketing and sales director Kristjan Seema, these years are characterised by the innovative design of the flagship, the visual scanner, the screen with the 4K resolution from the edge to the edge and the ultra-fast processor.
Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also reached the front of the Estonian smart phones sales list, caused great excitement in the technology world.
In the autumn, smart people will be allowed to charge even more quickly, a more durable battery, a more high-quality camera and greater water and dust security.
He added that, on the basis of the rumors, four top models could already be made and predicted, which are likely to take over the sales agendas this year.
These four high-end smart phones models will reach the stores in the autumn of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach the stores already in mid-September.
There's a lot of rumors about what the new Apple model looks like and what it can do.
If iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences next to iPhone 6s, Apple’s tenth birthday is expected to be completely different from the previous one.
There are four colours spoken of: black, white, pink gold and chrome.
One of the elements of the new design is probably the screen that covers the entire front panel of the phone, the home button has been lost, and the fingerprint is built inside the screen.
The Apple Design Manager JonyIve insists that a new iPhone model looks like a smooth glass.
There has also been a discussion about the ceramic version of iPhone.
In addition to the eye-irrigated scanner, wireless charging and even more high-quality camera, a faster A11 processor can be expected.
I'm sure it's one of the smart phones we've been waiting for.
The pre-ordering of the brand new Galaxy Note 8 will begin on 23 August.
There's been a lot of rumors about what new Galaxy Note 8 looks like.
It is heard that even more is meant for business users and S Pen allows even greater functionality.
There should be two cameras on the phone, one of which is a wide-angle and the other is a TV lens with a narrower field of view.
At the moment, no one knows what two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, Samsung's first test, which is certainly comparable to iPhone 8.
But we're looking forward to 23 August.
Although Nokia has sold three smart phones this year with Nokia 6, their flagship - Nokia 8, which will be presented on 16 August.
We are waiting from Nokia for the 5.3-inch edge to the edge of the screen and the ultra-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and more durable battery.
For Nokia, the aluminium body and the significant degree of water and dust security are also discussed.
Like Samsung, Nokia's new model has two rear cameras, which are produced by Zeiss.
If Sony has been a certain flagship so far XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smart phones will be added in the near future with even more innovative features.
We're waiting for a smartphone that's slightly more modest than the XZ Premium, but at least with the same good or better camera.
Sony's new model has been speculated to have at least a six-inch screen.
What brings us to reality can be seen soon, because traditionally Sony has published its autumn flagship at the International Technology Fair IFA, which will take place this year from 1 to 6 September.
According to the wiretaps of phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall
The Washington Post published the transgenders of telephone calls between the US President Donald Trump and the Mexican and Australian Heads of State.
On January 27, Trump made a phone call to the Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, to close the public declaration that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The president of the United States collided with him for the public condemnation of the wall, saying, "You must not say that to the press."
Trump set up his presidential campaign on the promise to build a South American border wall and swore that Mexico would pay for this project.
Transcripts were also published from his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which reveals an intense exchange of views.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States of America would take on refugees heading for Australia was "murky", "murky" and "rumal". He claimed that the agreement that was made during Obama's government would leave him as a "leader" because he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States.
Trump finished the call, informing Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant speech of the day".
The Supreme Court did not hear a complaint by OÜ MRP City Lines in which the City of Tartu rejected their offer for the purchase of bus services from July 2019 to 2029.
This is a decree that rejected the tender of OÜ MRP Linna Liinid on the Tartu bus procurement, as the tender did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Abihtin, the manager of the Tartu City Law Service.
It is a public bus service within the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
The lines of the City of MRP appealed to the Supreme Court for judgment of the Tartu District Court.
The Supreme Court did not deal with it.
Although many in social media complain that the noise from the Weekly Festival upsets their nights and the whole city is filled with drunk partyers, there are also many who do not have a bad word to say about the festival on the beach.
I'm even positively surprised that the shops were so polite!
I didn't see any blurry or rudeness.
I even saw kindness," Laine says.
"It's nice to come, be and enjoy Pärnu, which is left in winter like a winter sleep," she added with joy.
I don't care about the seaside snort of Laine's sleep.
When he found out that music was played on the beach when he lived downtown, the music had not yet reached his home.
"But I hope to hear it," he says with joy.
Agnes, who has also spoken to the evening paper, says that the big festival is more than good for Pärnu - it does a great deal of work for the local merchants.
In addition, he is pleased that so many foreigners have come to visit the summer capital.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Even though I'm no longer at the beach, I'm glad the beach is alive.
And I'm glad the people are moving, and it's been like this three times," she says.
I guess the first time was a little worse.
"Then perhaps there were complaints," he ponders.
However, he said that the noise on the beach is common for the summerheads.
"This Weekly is a very good promotion for our little town," says Harri, who's in the park.
Noise and nobility have never put his rhythm in the way of his life.
What about?!
We should all stick together.
Think of it as a better way to communicate between nations.
You don't crush a loud music man.
It doesn't bother me, although I live near there.
"Good people can hold together and there's no trouble," he says.
He says that visitors to Pärnu are polite.
"With bottles of course they have exaggerated a little, but young people are young and Lord God - let go, but be human and we can handle it!" he says.
By then, coastal residents have traveled away, either to relatives or to acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival has a positive impact on life - people like this noise", says Tiina, who has walked with children in Pärnu.
His family’s dream music is not disturbed either, although last year it came even further from this year.
Last summer was the other side of the stage, then we heard more.
We live out of the city ourselves, that it actually takes us a long way to the Pärnu River," he says.
Pearson cuts more than 3000 jobs and reduces dividends to revitalize business
On Friday, the British educational company Pearson said that it would cut down another 3000 jobs and reduce its differentials by 72%, thereby launching another restructuring programme to solve the difficulties of the business.
The jobs to be lost, which, according to CEO John Fallon, are highly likely to be created at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, will be added to the 4000 posts lost during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced in May that under the third cost reduction programme, the costs would be reduced by another GBP 300 million (394 million USD) in order to try to reinvigorate the business that has been hit by the rapid transition to digital learning.
The company that agreed last month to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner company Bertelsmann said that their expectations regarding the year have not changed since the 1 % increase in sales revenue was reported at GBP 2,05 billion in the first half of the year.

Convoying in Kabul: suicide killed NATO soldier
According to officials, a suicide bomber attacked a military protest in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, killing one NATO soldier and wounded several others.
The NATO statement said you were injured by five soldiers and an interpreter.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were killed in the Qarabagh district incident.
This bombing is the last of the violent acts that have hit Afghanistan this month: on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in Herat's Moche attack.
On Monday, two people were killed by a suicide bomber in Kabul near the Iraqi Embassy.
NATO's statement said that a Thursday night explosion took place when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with a "man-made explosive".
According to the statement, all were injured in a stable state and treated at the U.S. military airport at Bagram.
According to the coordinators, the Taliban and the group, known as the Islamic State (ISIS), are a serious source of concern for the forces in Qarabaghi, NATO Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1662 civilians have died in Afghanistan during the first half of 2017, of which approximately 20% have been killed in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb in Kabul killed at least 30 people in the Shiite division.
According to the Taliban, they were behind the attack.
On 31 May, more than 150 people were killed by a large bomb attack in the city centre, which has led to the most deaths in the country since the US-led forces deported the Taliban in 2001.
This violence highlights the uncertain security situation in Afghanistan, while President Donald Trump of the United States is considering whether to increase the number of U.S. troops and police forces.
According to the coordinators, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public crisis of confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghan.
EPA annulled the decision to postpone the wolf Regulation following the actions
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the United States of America annulled the decision to delay the introduction of the Obama-time regulation, which obliges the States to limit the emissions causing the mist, one day after 15 states have suspensively susived the Agency due to its action.
EPA announced its decision to continue with "Ozone 2015 activities" late on Wednesday, saying that it demonstrates the Agency's commitment to co-operation with the States.
"We believe that we need to have dialogue and listen to our states' partners," said EPA leader Scott Pruitt in his statement.
Pruitt had announced in June that EPA was intending to postpone the determination of ozone levels in different parts of the country to determine where its level should be reduced by one year in October 2018 in order to meet the stricter air quality standard.
15 mainly the democratic state, together with the Colombian community, brought an action on Tuesday, saying that this decision is illegal.
The government of President Donald Trump has tried to withdraw a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama.
But these efforts have caused counter-reactions among the Democrats and nature conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of increased pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that inhaling ozone-containing air "may reduce lung function and increase the risk of respiratory disease" such as asthma.
German pigs can have a party.
German pigs and cattle may have a party, as strong rains threaten the European Union's second-largest harvest, says Bloomberg.
This year, it may take weeks before harvest, to ensure that the fruit intended for the bread industry is only suitable for animal feed.
"This quality is far worse than last year and worse than in 2015," said Agravis Raiffeiseni analyst Bernhard Chilla.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat can be used as animal feed, which is double as usual, predicted by Agravis.
German farmers, like their European colleagues, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
First, the winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which was replaced by a hot wave in June.
In July, Germany was hit by rainfalls, which continued in August.
Many eyes are turned to northern Germany, where rain prevents harvest.
Only five percent of the wheat has been harvested so far.
Most of the area has not even started harvesting, the local harvester Ceravis announced.
"It's been a very difficult day," said Cerevis' senior trader Frank Deckert from Rendsburg.
Consistency in all, or Finnish interior design, clever swings
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the mess homes, as large windows reach the magnificent views of the Saimaa shores in many rooms (life).
At every step, our northern neighbours’ efforts to create both harsh and perfect (energy-efficient) homes begin.
The ability to use Finnish wood as construction and finishing materials, furniture and beauty goods is worthy of absorbance and compliance.
Vibrating techniques and smart solutions can be found in mess houses by both the builder and the (home) designer.
It goes without saying that black, white and grey shades, when supplemented by wooden tones and furniture, can be very moody.
Good ideas can be picked up for another week, as the mass lasts until August 13.
Appetizers and pots point to frequent cooking in this kitchen.
At night, a line was drawn to this year's Weekly Festival Baltic, and Martin Garrix gave him everything he could to remember as the last performer.
The crowd was really turned around during the Garrix performance, singing, flute, dancing in a self-sufficient way.
When Garrix finished, the crowd was spread out of Pärnu Beach to the city.
Let's get you a gallery with all the pictures our photographer caught in the Week in three days.

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko will meet for the first time, discussing possible contradictions.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to face up to 66,7 kg in the most attractive boxing match in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were at ESPN's office in Los Angeles in separate rooms, until Garcia, an undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked the second end of the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, World Boxing Organization's featherweight champion.
After a unanimous decision by Garcia's victory over the former four-time world champion, Adrian Broner, in the showtime on Saturday, both of the fighters are in the premise of the ranking list.
Garcia handed her right hand and said, "How are you doing, champion?
I wish you luck."
Lomachenko protects his belt against Miguel Marria Saturday night at 19 p.m. at ESPN.
When a couple posed for photos, Lomachenko's manager, Egis Klimas, noted that a possible contrast between the fighters would be "perfect measurement".
"I'm a former featherweight," said Garcia.
"I moved up for Broner [63.5 kg], but I'm not that big.
I'm 63.5 kg small.
I want to move down the light weight.
And he must move upwards of light weight [61,2 kg], and then we can fight.
That's what fans have wanted.
Let's offer them this."
Lomachenko agreed.
"The world of hell needs this fight."
Klimas raised the question of whether it should be paid, which is part of his strategy that he wants to have Lomachenko debuted to the end of this year in the 61.2 kg class to make it possible for next summer to meet Garcia (37-0, 30 nokaut), who also has an interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their lightweight round Forum on 23 September.
"Looking at this struggle could be a reward because the fans have wanted this contrast," said Garcia, saying later that she is open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
"We're the main performers.
No other name can get that much attention.
Whenever they're ready...
Garcia said she thought Lomachenko was a great fighter and could go see his Saturday fight.
Lomachenko, however, was modest at the praise of Garcia, saying that he thought that the three divisions from Riverside saw "very slow; I'm sorry, Mikey... you wanted this to happen".
Garcia said the goal was to show the strength of the punch and then fight.
Both confirmed that they felt that the tension was growing to gain wealth between them.
"It's a fight waiting to be realised.
No other opposition produces so much attention and humina.
I'm more than willing to work for it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best fighters, and Mikey's just like that.
It'll be a good fight."
Which corners of the world are being moved to Estonia?
In the past, the Police and Border Guard Office (PPA) extended and issued a record of over 13 000 residence permits to third-country nationals who have mostly traveled to Estonia to work, study or to the family.
For example, if last year it was decided to issue a temporary residence permit to 6702 foreigners, then this number was 4928.
The authorities do not know how many immigrants will eventually remain in Estonia, but such an analysis will be carried out in the Ministry of Interior.
When nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia every year ten years, this figure will be close to 2000 in recent years.
The number of applicants for a residence permit increased by a leap during the Ukrainian crisis - 1087 persons received a temporary residence permit in 2014, a year earlier 675.
According to the Statistical Office, the number of citizens of Ukraine will increase most in Estonia - 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia last year more than they left.
"The Ukrainian community has always been large in Estonia, and because of the difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought in a country where the community and many of the family are already ahead," said Kristin Rammus, the press representative of the Ministry of Interior.
The number of Ukrainians who received a temporary residence permit was higher than the number of Russian citizens, although the most temporary residence permits have been issued in total for 10 years.
If the Ukrainians come here to work mostly, then Russian citizens are on account of family migration.
"In view of the historic Russian community here, they are most likely to have the biggest family ties with the people living in Russia," said Helina Maasing, migration researcher at the Academy of Internal Defence.
"While looking at where the Russian citizens who have been admitted to the Estonian residence permit have moved to live, after Harjumaa, he added that about 40 per cent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
In the past, 1696 Russian citizens received a temporary residence permit, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians wishing to extend their residence permit decreased.
"The reason for this is that instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been applied for permanently to enter Estonia," Rammus, the press representative of the Ministry of Interior, explained that the interest of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has remained stable for years rather than years.
A new residence permit for permanent residence in Estonia can be applied for by foreigners who lived here for at least three years from last year.
Its purpose is to encourage the people who are adapted to them to stay here.
However, a long-term resident’s residence permit takes five years, for example.
The renewal of the old residence permit has probably also decreased due to the new residence permit.
For example, 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years were granted residence permits for the last year.
Now the Ukrainians can change their jobs, and the Estonian state will no longer be able to make a point whether the pay criterion has been met.
This residence permit became very popular - the applicants for the last year's grey passport holders (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
In total, in 1968, 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and as many Chinese people received a residence permit for the purpose of moving to Estonia.
With the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In ten years, Nigeria has surprisingly become a country whose citizens are one of the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
When three residence permits were issued to Nigerians in 2007, 200 residence permits were issued last year.
They're coming from Nigeria to study at these universities.
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular, for example, among Georgians, Chinese and Turkishs.
The number of citizens in India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased predominantly due to the mobility of studies.
Rammus added.
In ten years, two people have also moved to Estonia from, for example, North Korea, as much Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If 6000 third-country nationals are granted residence permits per year, this is about 0.46 per cent of the total population.
Even if there were more citizens of the European Union, migration remains at about a percentage," said Maasing, in fact, the figures are small.
According to the Statistics Office's data, 14 822 people moved to Estonia last year, while 13 792 moved out of here.
That means immigration exceeded the second year of emigration.
Most of the displaced and displaced persons are Estonian citizens, but more are among those leaving.
As a result, the migration balance of Estonian citizens last year was reduced by 2000 people.
Estonians travel primarily between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture's princess fashion is enchanting with sats, embroidery and fight.
The Northern Ideal Time is still a history for Maria Tammeoru - old paintings and costumes: "I can dream of an hour in a museum and admire old-fashioned sleeves and collars.
If you do something about passion, you study and learn more about it every day.
It's a joy of discovery!
Mammu Couture's glamorous world may look like some stranger, but the designer doesn't think so.
You decide how much shine your life is!
I have a friend who has a whole sauna full of my haute couture dresses.
Because it's not his fault that he doesn't live in Hollywood and doesn't go on a red carpet every day, he wants to wear those most beautiful dresses, and he does!
You can live your own life as special!
The fashion artist does not recognize the gap between the shining events and the gray everyday day.
It was this thought that led to a rolling plan to bring high-end fashion to Estonian lands, between forests and fields, to people who often do not get to fashion.
The Mammu collection was presented, for example, in Võru, Jõhvi and Pärnu fashionalle, where the 45 model royal defilee filled the street.
In Tallinn, the shop is often taken in, nodded with dignity, but there are more emotions elsewhere – the bravo shouts, rises up, wants to thank you hand-to-hand.
A large part of the audience was just going to be remodeled, but now they're Mammu Couture fans.
If you cross people's expectations, they'll be thrilled!
And I like the feeling that I'm on a summer tour.
We had a 50 - foot - long red carpet full of beautiful dresses all over the street, and they didn't seem to stop!
Maria is also not fashionable that the creation must be presented to a supermodel, she willingly brings the stage to ordinary women.
I often invite my own clients on stage - they've always been happy to come.
It's such a wonderful experience, you can shine on the stage in a beautiful dress!
I'm so sorry I've never seen my show myself, I've always been behind stage to give the last of things as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerve wouldn't let me watch the hall calmly.
Maria is the kind of guy who wants to be in everything, not just in the representation role.
I have my sewing machine in the studio, most of the collection I do myself.
I like the whole process where you play with details, discover.
I'm never far away from my work, and I'm not afraid of work.
The design is not limited, including stylistics, logistics, organization, organization - everything has to fit into one of the temperament women's day.
Those hours of work are still huge for fanatics.
I can't tell you when my day is over, it's just a day full of joy to me!
I'm still very lucky - it's like an incessant chain of happiness: I'm doing something beautiful, man gets something beautiful and yet compliments.
Several times it has been said that my dresses have magic - they make you feel like a princess.
The bona fide satires that made Maria's talent famous overnight have remained Mammu Couture's signature until today.
Martin Müürsepp U18 of boys: the Estonian subgroup tournament gun was now turned against us
Too bad the fairy tale ran out.
The first thing we saw was that we couldn't get our table.
And when such a big difference comes in at the table, there is nothing to be done", Estonia commented the only basketball player in our NBA, Martin Müürsepp, assistant coach at BC Kalev/Cramo.
The opponents took 28 balls from the strike table and received so many more attacks.
We weren't ready for their aggressive defense or attack, either, it created.
Many English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we couldn't build protection.
By protecting them, however, they got to keep their hands between them everywhere, so we couldn't combine them.
It hit the crew's feet.
The work of the opponents was better done.
According to Myursepa, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to remove the adversary's momentum.
In the last quarter, we had a zero error, but our opponents have already received several quick baskets.
Athleticism and tight action, which was our weapon in the subgroup tournament, now all turned against us.
Today, we had no strength against their aggression.
The wallsmith was satisfied with his caretaker in Kalev, Matthias Tassi.
In general, the tournament can say good words about the whole team, so far a uniform blow has been achieved.
It's a shame you've met such an aggressive opponent before.
The cup has always been confident and played out today, but it seemed that he was tired – he has carried quite a burden.
But he made some pretty moves I've seen in practice before," added the supervisor.
Horrible numbers: three quarters less than 10 points on the EM tournament...
In the U18 age class there is not only a basketball tournament for young men in the EM B division in Tallinn, the girls began the night before in Dublin.
And Estonia's game with Poland, however, hit the field of anti-resects.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third quarter was still at 9:49, or only in the last ten minutes, the opponents took their feet off the gas pedal and that period remained at Viking 16:16.
In both the first and second quarters, Estonia threw 4, in the third 1 points...
In the first two minutes, the Estonians caught two of the first four shots, and then by 25 pieces, then one of the three, and then 21 more shots...
Maybe in almost half an hour, one of the 47 shots was hit.
In addition, two points came out of four free shots.
The number of ball losses in this time was reasonable, 12.
At the end of the game, Poland had a throw-out rate of 33 per cent and Estonia had 13 per cent (68/9).
Estonia has begun with two disappearances, and on the day of opening it had to acknowledge the better of Portugal 83:56.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to supplement supplies
Today, NATO’s 1st permanent mine control group arrived in Tallinn for the weekend in order to complete the supplies of ships and prepare for the forthcoming exercises.
In the course of the visit, ships will prepare to return to the sea, giving crew members the opportunity to take a few days’ vacation.
After the visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters to carry out several exercises and be prepared for future historic explosives search operations.
"The participation of the Estonians in the NATO unit and their co-operation training in local waters is well reflected in our integration with the Allied Forces," said the Chief of Operation and Planning Division of the Navy Commander, Major Arto Reinmaa.
Since 29 June, NATO has been led by Latvian Marine Lieutenant General Gvido Laudups, who took over the duties of the group leader at the ceremony in Riga from Estonian Marine Officer Lieutenant Johan-Elia in Seljamaa.
The group's flagship vessel is designated as a Latvian maritime support ship in LVNS Virsaitat, which also operates under the command of the group.
This semester also includes the Estonian Navy Mine Hunter Sakala.
One of the four groups of vessels under NATO Marine Command is NATO's permanent mine control group 1 of the primary rapid response units, which the alliance can send to different world places within five days.
From 4 to 13 August, the ancient ruins of the monastery of Pirita will be once again a place where the Birgitta Festival, called to life by the Maestro Erika, will be held 13 years ago.
This year's Birgitta Festival will be awarded to Risto Joosti (36), the artistic director of Tallinn Philharmonic, says it will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
Risto Joost: The audiences reach the classics of the opera world by "Travita" and "Tosca", the ballet performances from the enchanting "Bolerost" amusing "Karlssonini", and the plan is not missing its own production, which is this time the production by the same international creative team of Joseph Haydn's wonderful Orarium, who brought Pirital to the stage of Haydn's second masterpiece "Creative".
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre performances.
It's bigger than any music theater in its usual form.
It's a festival where the charm takes control and never lets it go again.
For the experience of a listener in this sublime and mysterious environment makes the human souls sound and affects the human senses in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, you're an artistic director of the Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't the shoes of the maestro Erik Klas seem a little large?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Special Klas, I've been very helpful.
He led me through my entire student career and supported me at the beginning of the career.
Maybe that's why it's easier for me to continue her work.
The Special Class has injected so much goodness into the Birgitta Festival team and, of course, it will all be passed on to me.
It was great to join a team who knows exactly what's going on.
The great heart of Eri Klas also gave me the strength to move forward with the Birgitta Festival in Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am, and I can handle it!
What could excite the audience this year at the festival, what are you offering?
We have an artist from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, as a surprise, we have the first ballet written on Astrid Lindgren's story.
It's "Karlsson Flys."
And one of the criminal nuances is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Yuris Karlsons, who himself expressed his desire to write it.
Apparently, he's had Karlsson's character since he was a child.
Risto, how are you doing with all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner, I'm sure.
Such work needs a support system and a lot of love, and I am fortunate to have it.
And I've noticed that my personal emotions don't depend as much on other people as I can on myself, or how I can handle every new day.
And keeping such a conscious tone, keeping positiveness and actually smiling at yourself in the morning in the mirror, significantly increased my percentage of happiness.
Especially now this week, when the most important samples are being tested, I've been working very hard on this and it's working.
Smile at yourself activates the brain and increases tone.
It's not just a word.
I don't think people know half the things about their bodies that the universe offers them, but they're all about to discover it.
Now, this is an important moment.
Do you have any rituals before the conductor enters the remote?
Yes, it is. We have to change clothes for the more comfortable.
It's a little moment for yourself.
But in general, I don't have a chance to rest until I get a big show or take a nap.
In fact, I even like to communicate actively with people, even before I enter the principal.
But everyone, come to the Birgitta Festival, there's something to discover for a friend of not very big opera and ballet!
Watch the moody video with Risto Joost!
New results of the assessment of the age of Swedish asyl seekers were published
In Sweden, a test was carried out amongst asyl seekers to evaluate their age with an innovative approach medically. The latest results of the test show that more than 80 per cent of the untested were considered older than 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of Judicial Medicine (Rättsmedinalverte) started the tests in the beginning of this year.
The tests were set up for a more accurate assessment of the age during the application for azyl after criticism of the Swedish Immigration Service (Migrationsverket) for failure to properly determine the age of several alleged minors.
To date, migrationsverke has sent 6880 cases for testing, and the Institute of Justice has issued a total of 2481 tests between mid-March 2017 and 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 years old or older, and in 25 other cases, the Institute of Medicine assessed that the test "may be 18 years old or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that a person is "presumably younger than 18".
The test shall be used only if the age of the person is at stake.
According to Johan Göransson, working at the Institute of Justice, the results are consistent with those of previous months.
"We don't see a big difference from last month's statistics, numbers are quite consistent," he said to The Local.
The fact that a large proportion of cases were considered older than 18, does not necessarily mean that applicants for azyl have lied about their age.
In May, the Institute issued 581 test results and said that in 442 cases, "there are indications that the person under investigation is 18 years old or older".
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagblade examined the results of these 581 tests, it turned out that in 243 cases a person had directly claimed that he would receive 18.
This medical age assessment method, which is used for X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI of knee joints and which is then used by dentists and radiologists, has been criticised in some circles.
One of the sceptics is Endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose tasks include an assessment of human biological maturity to determine whether they passed the puberty sooner or later.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I do not think that the measurement method currently used should be used.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, then we shouldn't make a face that we can," he said to the Metro newspaper.
But Johan Göransson, from the Institute of Court of Justice, defended the accuracy of the tests: "It can generally be said that the child’s risk of inaccuracies in the celling of an adult is low.
The highest risk, or at about 10%, is the risk if a person is a little less than 18."

The 20-year-old hammer thrower Anna Maria Orel made a beautiful debut in London, becoming a good 18th place with 67.37.
Orel was M.M.I.'s youngest female leftover, and the joyful woman confirmed that she would hope to fight for medals in the future.
The competition went well and I got a good experience.
With the first test (64.80), I immediately took my average result, the second one (62.80), and the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head straight," said Orel after the competition.
I was looking for my emissions, and I'm really glad I found it.
Anna Maria Orel's M.M. Debut ended well in 18 places.
The rainforest didn't interfere with Orel because he's training the winter through the T.C.U. Stadium.
"I'm banished," he said with a little mute.
The London Olympic Stadium had almost a full-house section of the people, did Orel sense people around him, or could he turn himself off?
I got it, but in a positive way.
Everyone says it gives more - that's it!
If you compete, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that he would remain at peace with the M.M.I. debut and that there would be a lot of good competitions for him: "I came here this season on the 32nd or the last result, finished at 18.
This is a very decent result.
I'm 20 years old and I'm MM. It's the only thing that matters.
I'm taking along a good experience, and I want to race for the medals some days.
Governor of West Virginia announced a party exchange
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced at the meeting on Thursday evening with President Trump that he would change parties.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats walked away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I say to you, having prayed and thought many times... "Today I say to you West Virginia, "I can no longer help you as a democratic governor."
When the assembly began, cheers were fired.
"This will make me a Republican tomorrow," added Justice.
"If I were a trainer, I'd tell you it's time to play another game."
Trump had promised a big announcement at the meeting in West Virginia earlier.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support the candidate for Democrats Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, proved to be elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and he owns coal business from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
At the same time, on Thursday evening, the National Committee of the Republicans (RNC) announced that "the exchange of Governor Justice's party is another blow to the democratic parties, which would be more likely to prevent the country from being better off than to work for it".
"Out of the 15 governors and control of the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice's statement is simply the most recent rejection of parties that are out of control and cannot find a positive and connecting message," said Ronna McDaniel, Chairman of the RNC, in a statement to CBS News.
It's no surprise that there's a lot of people out there, too, that there's a lot of injured people.
Urmet, who worked in the weekly medical tent, said to the Evening magazine yesterday that they had to hand out quite a lot of patches.
The wools and the noises are basic, the twists out and the light fallouts.
Of course, the headaches, back and leg pains.
According to Urmet, visitors come to the festival with the wrong shoes and that's how the problems come.
Medics have also had to help a couple of more injured visitors - there have been panic attacks and also a broken leg.
We have also made seams when a person has broken his hand or finger.
We'll make the smaller seams here, send the larger ones to the hospital.
Check the video to see if the festive doctors are also asking for a painkiller to treat the pohmell.
Coe accepted the Russians' sincere apology for the doping candal.
According to him, the international nostrilsman of the Light Forces, Sebastian Coe, accepted "Russia's honest excuse for Thursday" for the doping candalism, but repeated that it is not time to allow the country back sport.
The Russian Snobbler Dmitry Shylakhtin said at the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Cup, that the competition ban imposed on his country is correct and that he has a certain aim of fighting doping.
He apologized to "all the light-powered men who have been caught in the competitions by gold medals and silver medals".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the competition ban imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Dumping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-supported doping in Russia.
"I think it was a very honest response today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to journalists.
"The Health Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Union itself also acknowledged that they had had quite difficult times and that they would do everything possible to restructure the Sub-Union."
According to Coe, he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its restoration.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made, but the Congress supports the group's proposal that this is not the time to withdraw Russia," said Coe.
"We'll have to do everything possible in the next few months to normalize the situation.
We have always followed the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian LBAs, which meet the strict criteria of the IAAF, will compete as neutral athletes at the world championships of the light power starting in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF Group, said on Monday that Russia still does not meet many of the recovery criteria.
After his presentation to the IAAF Council, he said to the journalists in London that the doping check is still inadequate and that the disabled trainers still operate freely.
The revolution of electric cars makes a significant difference in the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and the losers?
The fact that the revolution of electric cars will significantly change everything from the fuel market to the infrastructure will also create new winners and losers in the metal market.
Although miners like Glencore can say that they win and lose from one place, smaller mining companies don't help.
Glencore currently serves coal and oil, but in the future, in the era of electric cars, the demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel will grow.
This year, the UK, France and Norway have made contributions to the distribution of electric cars, which will allow the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned in the coming decades.
That's why Volvo has already known that they're planning to give up the internal combustion engine, and Tesla will bring a cheaper model 3 electric car to the market.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance is forecast to sell more electric cars than cars using oil-based fuels for two decades.
"For some metals, this changes everything," said Capital Economics raw materials analyst Simona Gambranini Bloomberg.
We have already seen a great impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, whose demand has been growing for years.
The electric cars have about three times more copper than the conventional car, reported Glencore.
More copper is needed at loading stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribas estimates that it will increase copper demand by about five per cent by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric car batteries means additional lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese demand.
Glencore derives from the growing trend of electric cars from the price increase of copper and the world's largest cobalt producer, Jefferies Group predicted.
According to this broker company, Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals are the other winners of the electric car race.
The market is already responding to a changing trend.
This year, 70 percent of the cave on the London metal exchange has gone up.
The price increase for the year was 37 per cent.
Copper has also increased 14 percent this year, mainly due to growth.
Glencore's share increased by 20 percent in London after crossing rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo America.
On the losing side, lead companies such as Recclex and Campine have to adapt to the new era.
Lead end-use is the main power supply for start-ups for petrol and diesel-powered cars.
Electric cars use lithium batteries.
"This is a serious risk to the pollen, unless it is found to have another purpose to overcome the fall in demand," said Michael Widmer, the analyst of the metal market at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The lead price movement has yet to notice the impact of the break-up trend.
Lead has increased by 17 percent this year, which is the best metal in London, among the main industrial metals.
Investors will only see problems with metal in the far future.
"I'm not sure that the lead is so bad because cheap oil keeps regular cars competitive," said Triland Metals salesman Herwig Schmidt.
If the demand for lead falls, it will happen slowly.
Maybe it'll happen in about ten years.
In the meantime, tougher exhaust standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars will increase, which will depend on advanced lead-based batteries when starting frequent engines, will be assessed by the international lead and zinc research organisation.
Light metals such as aluminium replace steel as a lighter car can drive further away with less electricity.
This can be explained by an additional 1.6 million tonnes of aluminium demand up to 2013-2016.
This represents 2.7 percent of the world's total aluminium production.
It's likely this trend is getting worse, said Widmer.
Aluminium has increased by 13% this year, as growing demand by car manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
Steel producers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding cooperates with General Motors in order to use nanotechnology for the production of lightweight car shells.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter alloy of steel to resist aluminium.
"Exane BNP Paribas analyst Sylvain Brune said.
There is some success in Europe.
The end of the oil age can also bring suffering to platinum.
About half of this precious metal diesel was used as catalysts for cars, reported by metal refiner Johnson Matthey.
"Many of the raw materials with high demand today, such as oil and platinum, may not have high demand in the future," said Natixis raw materials analyst Bernard Dahdah.
This does not mean that the raw materials as a whole become less important, but their importance will change over a period of 15 years.
Platinum manufacturers believe in continuing demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Uncore driver Marc Grynberg said that in 2025 more hybrid cars will continue to be sold than full electric cars.
In the 10-year term, the great hope of the platinum manufacturers is for the cars developed by the Tobya Motor and Hyundai Motos based on hydrogen element, which depend on the platinum to produce hydrogen electricity.
So far, however, this technology has not commercially justified itself.
"Disel seems to be a clear loser on the way to electric cars," said Exane from BNP Paribas, Brunet.
In July, the German car manufacturers suffered a major setback because Stuttgart’s court banned the use of diesel in the home town of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How football financial rules affect Neymar's transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unbridled consumption of European football clubs do not prevent the world record transition of Neymar from the Spanish football club to the Paris-Saint Germain French club.
Any consequences of the UEFA, the governing body of the European game and the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious League of Masters, Paris Saint-Germain is still ahead.
The UEFA Financial Rules for Fair Game (FFP) established in 2011 mean that PSG must at some point prove that Neymar's transition was financed without huge losses.
EUR 222 million (EUR 262 million) was paid to Barcelona alone for the purchase of a Brazilian from his contract, and Neymar's salary starts to reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of the transfer of Neymar to the French club.
PSG will undoubtedly be able to pay for such money to recruit Neymar and to add it to its starboard lineup, given that the team is financed by the family that controls the energy crime in Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of time recruiting players, but they have to balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to come out in football stars.
FFP was set up by Michel Platinum after being elected President of UEFA in 2007.
This ex-French player believed that clubs that were looking for success in large debts actually deal with fraud and risk ruining if banks or owners had to give up their support.
As of 2011, FFP focuses on monitoring their losses instead of the debts of the clubs.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich used first in 2003 at Chelsea - to buy a club with potential and then to spend a lot of time making the team better and creating a global brand - is harder to apply.
In the present three-year assessment period of FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs may bear losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the disgraceful rejection of Platinum from the Presidential Office in 2015, his successor to UEFA, Alexander Cefer, remains committed to preventing excessive spending.
"The FFP is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules in the future," said Andrea Traverso of the Associated Press last week, who is the supervisor of FFP at UEFA.
Although PSG paid for Neymar’s acquisition clause in a single total payment, it is possible for them to split that amount into shares for accounting purposes throughout the duration of the contract.
Neymar has concluded a five-year contract and can therefore be shown as a sum of EUR 44,4 million per year over the next five years.
In the case of the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, together with Abu Dhabi’s Manchester City, received the most severe punishments.
A fine of EUR 60 million (EUR 82 million at the moment) was imposed on PSG, which was subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million, and the club was required to limit the Team of the Masters League to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to plan the regulatory financial institutions by blowing up their income through companies related to the owners of the club.
While the company of Qatar may sponsor PSGs, if the value of sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered as an official income.
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority PSG support had been up-to-date.
It has been said that certain parts of Neymar’s PSG service can come from Kataris through the World Championship Management Board’s payments of 2022.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could become a world champion and claim that UEFA regulators could easily reveal such a maneuver.
Penalties previously imposed on PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in any attempt to ignore the rules.
People who are familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA has not discussed the transition of Neymar proactively with PSG.
They spoke to the Associated Press on condition that they were granted anonymity because they were not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
The most recent reports show that PSG made more than EUR 10 million in profits during the 2015-2016 season at around EUR 542.4 million in turnover.
Data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that Neymar's arrival will have a good impact on sponsorship transactions, trade and shirt sales.
The club expects an increase of at least 30 % in turnover in connection with the conclusion of the contract.
The Spanish league, clearly upset by the departure of one of the biggest football stars, sought to prevent the transition of Neymar, claiming that PSG was in violation of FFP.
"This is a clear "monetary doping" case with the club and the state," said La Liga President Javier Tebas to the Spanish newspaper AS, indicating that PSG belongs mainly to Qatar.
Arsenal’s manager Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnate, shares La Liga’s view that the state is financing the club.
"This is the consequence of property rights, and it has completely changed the entire football world over the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"If the club belongs to the state, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of an honest game, since the state may have other ways or other interests to represent such a large player."
Norwegian low-cost Norwegian is a nice tradition of putting pictures of those who have moved borders and been inspired by others in their own field, writes trip.ee
In addition to the expansion of Norwegian operations, the circle of people who have earned a place in the aircraft race has also expanded.
Among the selected persons are Benjamin Franklin, Greta Garbo (on photo) and Miguel de Cervantes.
In the near future, however, one plane will be decorated with the portrait of the legendary singer Freddie Mercury.
Today 50 years ago: hurricane storm in Estonia, which torn roofs and windows from the houses.
A hurricane named the storm of the century, which raged on August 6 and 7, caused major damage to the West, Harjumaa and Raplamaa in particular.
In Northwest Estonia, the wind speed during these days was more than 30 m/s.
My old man ran from one curved tree to another in the garden and touched them with his hands.
Everything was dark and rough, like the end of the world.
The roofs were already flying from the houses, and in 2002, old Mrs Linda Kurova reminded the magazine Haapsalu of the interview given by Estonian Nature.
Linda's husband saw her planted garden collapse.
But what do you still support with your hands where you're going to get against a storm like this?
The sea came under the window and sprayed water from the windows," said Mrs. Linda, living on the street of Haapsalu Kalda, then.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and the railway station’s platform roof had flown 20-30 metres away, Linda saw as much as the next morning.
Locally speaking, the trees behind Paralepa were down, some completely down, some in half.
It all looked very depressing, the storm went through beautiful old trees with rags and cracks like war.
Western Virumaa was not particularly affected in the storm of August 1967 compared to West Estonia, but the damage was great there too, wrote the Virumaa Official Journal in 2007.
The Haapsalu Castle Park and Padis Park were sanctified from the ground, but our parks in the area were also severely affected.
At a speed of up to 35 metres per second in Tallinn, approximately 130 kilometers per hour.
On August 6th, Tallinn, Tallinn, a little girl named "Mom, Mom!
Chickens are in the air and can no longer be down," wrote the Virumaa Official Journal.
The Põli Manor building in Viljandi County was destroyed during the storm so that it was later decided to be demolished.
The constructions of the Türi ski jump hill, which were no longer restored to the August storm.
On August 12, 1967, the Red Star wrote that the cleaning of cities and settlements from fallen trees and their branches is proceeding slowly, and the inhabitants could contribute to the cleaning work.
In the storm, fruit fields also suffered a great deal, and the newspaper stated that "partial organisations must be incentivisors and directors, both in the field of repair and in the field of fruit".
Hurricanes can be discussed if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The record of the calm wind in Estonia lasts from November 2, 1969, when Ruhn was measured at a speed of 48 m/s.
The measuring instrument broke on the island of Onlydloo, so the speed of the strong wind measured there could not be accurately recorded.
Secret of clean bathing areas: night-time cleaning and bad beach weather
Colder summer weathers also mean a smaller cleaning resort in Tallinn’s bathing areas.
"If it's lost, people are on the beach, and if it isn't, there are no people," says the beach cleaner.
There are echoes on the shore of Strom North-Tallinn.
They are offered by a low-speed tractor of melodic competition, which plows stripes off the platter.
In fact, the last one is swiping through a seven - inch - deep sand, picking out seafreaks and people’s abandoned rucksacks — bottle caps, cigarette icons, and so forth.
People still come to the beach, whether the water is warm or not.
If it's a beautiful weather, people are on the beach, and if it isn't, there are no people," says Alexander Usov, the manager of the beach cleaning work at Haaberst.
It's 6.30 p.m., and the beach has a bitter clean-up, because at 8:00 a.m., the place needs people to be okay.
Usov's on the job by 4:00.
After Strom, he will keep an eye on Pirita, Lake Harku, Kakumäe, and Paljasaari Pikakari.
The amounts of waste have been reduced.
Years ago, there was much more.
People can now appreciate what is done for them," says Usov, who has cleaned the beach for 15 years.
It used to be that if something new got up, it was broken the next day.
They're already keeping what's on the beach.
Clean beach price
One of the major works on the beaches of Estonia is the cleaning of seaweed, or adru, on the shores of Estonia.
For example, 400 000 tons of it must be carried off the coastline of Pirita.
"It's an incredible amount," states Usov.
The second large category is municipal waste, or all that people leave behind.
On the shoreline of Strom, a distance of two and a half kilometres, there are eight large garbage containers that need to be emptied three times a week.
That's how much garbage happens.
However, colder summer weathers have meant that garbage is one-fifth less than otherwise.
The third species consists of abandoned items.
These are mostly children's lives.
As the harvest this time, Usov has swept a dozen model cars out of the sand.
They remain waiting for owners to take the beach route.
"They usually come out more, but it's a normal harvest." Usov already knows that soon he'll find them in the sand.
Children come to the beach and take toys to drown them again.
Disperse Trash
Erika Scholler, the representative of the administrative services of Haaberst, admits that the screening work of the tractor is disrupting the local authorities.
A noise that lasts from night to morning interferes with the dreams of people living in the neighborhood.
But it's impossible in the day.
In one month, the beach has to be screened twice.
"If we don't, the district will fine us," Scholler says.
However, similar to Pirita, Pikakar and Pärnu, the aim is also to get Strom Beach under the international quality mark of Blue Flag.
"There is much more work in Estonia than in Europe to ensure that the beaches are maintained," says Scholler.
We have more vessels and stones and harder to scale the sand.
However, there is less garbage on our beaches than elsewhere in Europe.
Upon hearing that there is talk of garbage on the beach, Martin, who lives near the beach of Strom, enters an unprovoked conversation circle between the journalist and the cleaning staff, highlighting the current bottlenecks of the beach.
There's a nasty picture everywhere in the morning.
The problem is with birds and bottle harvesters who have pulled the garbage bags," says Martin.
While it is difficult to expect people to be able to change their behaviour so far, Martin hopes that the city government will do something about garbage cans and, for example, put on covers to prevent at least birds from going on there to reform.
In general, however, Martin is satisfied with the development of the Strom Beach.
It's obvious that the city will take care of it.
With children’s fields, lighting and freshly asphalted teas, it has become more pleasant.
There was once a time when roller skates could only go one way," Martin says.
Foundings of the treasure cookie in Strom: coins, only coins
Since morning, the 40-year-old Dimitri has come to use a metal detector to comb the edge of the coast.
He doesn't think he'll find anything of value today or in the future.
Sea gods are not generous enough.
"I've been working on this for a year, and I haven't found anything of value yet," Dmitri says.
There are some euro coins, bottle caps, and also dangerous nails in Dmitri’s treasure bag, which will later throw into the trash bin.
Usually, there's still coins.
"You don't usually have gold, rings and stuff like that," says the treasurer.
Bank of England maintains interest rates at 0.25%
It is expected from the Bank of England that interest rates will remain at the same level as inefficient economic growth and inflation depression have softened speculation as a result of the rise.
The Bank of England has warned us that economic growth will continue to fall, as household tight income has put interest rates on hold.
The policy makers of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank (MPC) voted in favour of keeping the rates at 6:2 at 0.25% and fewer members are calling for an increase this month, as slow economic growth has weakened support for this increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its 2017 growth forecast by 1.7% and its 2018 growth rate by 1.6% and warned that pressure on households' incomes would persist, as inflation is still expected to rise close to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the Bank also indicated that the increase in rates would be necessary to contain inflation due to Brexit over the next few years and that a higher than expected increase in loan costs on the financial markets might be necessary.
The members also voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the mammoth package which was launched as a result of Brexit a year ago.
In February, the Bank will close the fixed-term financing scheme, which will offer low-cost financing to banks, although it said that this scheme is now expected to offer 15 billion pounds more, which is £ 115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision on the threshold, the Bank says: "In the medium-term forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) will be ineffective in the near future, as the difficult situation of households' real income will continue to have an impact on consumption."
With regard to the rates, it was repeated that some "financial policy tightening up" is necessary to alleviate inflation, and to some extent more than is expected on the markets.
The stock exchange is now predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any jumps are gradual and limited.
The Bank's reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to May forecasts of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The 1.8% growth forecast for 2018 remained stable.
After this news, the rate of GBP fell between the dollar and the euro.
The pound dropped to USD 0.5% to USD 1.31 and to EUR 0.11%.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth indicators, which have reduced the growing hopes of the rise in GDP from 0.2% in the second quarter to 0.3% in the previous three months.
The Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it will start to gain momentum.
The Bank's latest inflation report gave little reason to cheer up households suffering from rising inflation and miserable wage rises, saying that the situation will get even worse before recovery.
It was added that monetary policy will not prevent a loss of income in the next few years, but a marked recovery of wages is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The growing demand for British production also stimulates the economy due to weak pounds, which partly compensates for lower consumer costs.
The decision will be taken one year after the rates were taken in August last, after the shocking EU referendum, resulting in a sudden weakening of the pound.
According to the Bank, it is likely that it will take four years to fully infiltrate prices and the economy.
Before the bank's last decision, there was a growing demand for an increase in the rate, as inflation had increased the pressure on households in distress; in July three policy makers called for an increase of 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, compared to 2.9% last June, although the bank said it was expected to rise again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the excessive increase compared to the 2-percent objective was due to a completely weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco's mortgage brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline in the exchange rates, it seems that the mortgage market is becoming increasingly competitive again because the lenders want to work and hope to end the year positively.
The stock exchange seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are going to be concluded, as refinancing, often at service fees and low rates has become increasingly popular."
NHS is writing a HIV medicine for 10,000 people
Patients will have access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment since September after the battle at the Supreme Court to determine whether NHS should finance the medicine.
NHS England reported that during the initial three-year clinical trial, public health is now estimated to make 10,000 people available pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) tablets, which are administered prior to sexual contact and have shown a reduction of the risk of infection by approximately 86% in high-risk people.
NHS agreed to finance a clinical trial after the Board of Appeal supported the judgment of the Supreme Court last year, according to which NHS is able to pay for PrEP, despite the claim made by the Authority itself that the medicine should be financed by local authorities instead.
Simon Stevens, Executive Director of NHS England, welcomed this call announced on Thursday as a "new major intervention", while the National AIDS Fund (NAT) described it as a "reverse moment".
The sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to register people. In October there will be more clinics before the programme is introduced everywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure Prevention (PREP) is a course of HIV medicines that is taken prior to sexual contact to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces transmission of HIV among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there are enough medicines in the human body to prevent infection with HIV.
Such medicinal products may be taken daily or at the latest two hours before sexual contact.
Appropriate candidates include gay or bisexual men, transsexual people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and cannot be treated.
Clinical trials will identify suitable people who are willing to take part in clinical trials, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV-related partners are not receiving antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also be able to register their wish to participate in the program at the local sexual health clinic.
The programme costs GBP 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to obtain medicines this week after the international procurement procedure.
The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the real potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence of the person to whom the medicine is intended and how it is consumed and applied in a large picture.
Stevens said: "This new major intervention should complement and amplify the widespread and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV.
This is another milestone in the fight against one of mankind's greatest health problems for more than three decades."
Deborah Gold, Executive Director of NAT, said: "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is correctly targeted at those who need it and belong to a risk group, offers an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people with high risk of HIV in England will have access to a powerful new tool, individually managed and not dependent on negotiations with a partner, through a clinical trial funded by NHS, thereby improving many lives.
We welcome this announcement warmly."
Ian Green, Managing Director of Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "It is now essential to ensure that the clinical trial is quickly rejected and that no HIV risk group member is excluded.
Now that the clinical trial drug for PrEP is being obtained, we are on our way to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of being infected with HIV.
Prime Minister of Public Health Sharon Hodgson said: "The beginning of the clinical trial of PREP has been very welcome and greatly delayed after months of delays and the government's legs drag.
Evidence shows how much change this medicine can lead to the prevention of HIV and the discontinuation of this life-changing infection.
This clinical trial will lead us a step closer to fully understanding the benefits of the PrEP.
Now it is important that the clinical trial is taken over the country as soon as possible to protect people exposed to HIV and bring us a step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society."
The price of electricity rose by 12% in Estonia, while in Latvia and Lithuania the price of electricity fell.
In July, the difference between the next day's electricity exchange price between Estonia and Latvia and the price regions of Lithuania decreased to 1,94 euros, compared to 7,71 euros in June, Elering reported.
The main reason for this difference is the failure of the Lithuanian-Swedish Community.
In Estonia, the average exchange price of electricity was EUR 34,33 per megawatt-hour last month and the price rose by 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five per cent from EUR 36.27 per megawatt hour.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34,17 and the system price for Nord Pool on the electricity exchange was EUR 26,37 per megawatt-hour.
Prices rose 12 and seven percent, respectively.
Electricity between Estonia and Finland moved 75 per cent from the previous month to Estonia and 16 per cent from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining nine percent of the hours between the two countries did not carry out the following day’s transactions.
Electricity between Estonia and Latvia has been moving 99 per cent from Estonia to Latvia, and 73 per cent of the hours had total transmission capacity.
According to transactions on the last trading day of July, the price on the Nasdaq OMX market can be around EUR 34 per megawatt hour in August and EUR 37 per megawatt hour in September.
The price of carbon dioxide affecting the production price of electricity rose last month and transactions were made at a price of EUR 5,04-5,47 per tonne.
Living high - half floor and smart design tips have turned this little Earl Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate renovator, exchanged his home in Knightsbridge in 2014 for Earls Court's apartment.
It's on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and Joanne hasn't packed up her bags and reselled the apartment, it's a tribute to the new design.
"before that, I lived with a former partner in Knightsbridge on a much larger surface," Joanne said.
"I was looking for something that would be equivalent to my price.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment and it had the same high rates.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day."
Since the first visit, this 93-square-metre apartment has undergone a complete innovation.
At first, it was a single bedroom and a complex apartment – to reach the bedroom you had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and half-storey to take advantage of the high ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands," he said.
He hired Duck & Shed from the architecture and design studio operating in Erfan Azadi Notting Hill to take advantage of the 3.8 m high ceilings and create a home that would not just be a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two spaces to each other, so it was an architectural challenge to create a semi-story where you could stand up.
Erfan was supposed to come up with a creative approach.
"Metal construction is quite complex," he explains.
"We had to reorganise the rooms so they would be on each other's backs without having to bend.
It was not just the construction of the platform, but the steel structure that we used so that the height of both the upper and the lower space would be correct."
This setting allowed Erfan to create two rooms of full height on each other in the room with a lot of dramatic elements.
The glamour of the glamour under the retrouvius window opens from the half floor with an old left light.
Gold furniture, silver details and retro-reflective Serge Mouille luminaire with reflectors highlight the space style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatrical, spatial and brightness.
There are mirrors on both sides of the short corridor to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the rear wall looks like a window opening in another room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet offers a storage place for all Joanne’s dishes and glassware.
The living room has the opportunity to close the kitchen part if it is not used, creating an image of a glamorous room.
Convenient kitchens are nothing new.
At the kitchen, however, there is a unique fact that it is a garage - type lift door.
"There went a little bit of a design problem," explains Erfan from the MDF door with steel strength.
"It has a counterweight, which is why it slides very easily when it's pushed up."
Due to the smart use of the room and storage room, Joanne now has 16 extra squares, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"At the end of the day, the floor area is what you sell - or what gives value to real estate," says Erfan.
"The real estate broker enters an obsolete room and makes calculations based on the floor area."
Here they have been able to increase the floor surface, using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
"The materials are the ones that you touch and thus help to create an emotional bond with your home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with an electric cable in the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make the heart sound."
It shows that a good design and increased area help make a rather ordinary apartment something amazing.
In fact, they may even create a desire not to leave, as happened to Joanne.
The main character, Dane Jensen, is a head hunter in Chicago's skyscraper who competes with a colleague for a promotion.
It is not a sum of money other than earned that forgets all kinds of ethics.
A man only sees his wife and three children early in the morning and late in the evening.
In the first half of the film, I think it's a version of the business world of the Guard House - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's speech manager are similar.
As the film goes on, the less the frame-housed element remains, and the moralizing intention of the filmmakers is becoming increasingly apparent.
A life-changing experience is the cancer of the main character’s son’s disease.
Now we have to make a choice between work and family life.
A son dreaming of architectural office makes his father walk to the large buildings of Chicago to think about truly important things such as faith, goodness, love... not even a two - tower disaster.
After the third scene where the son opens his father’s eyes, it appears that the filmmakers have come up with the goal of making the audience cry, because even the most stubborn one with a heart cannot hold back tears when seeing a boy with a beloved cancer.
When a son falls into a coma and his condition soon seems hopeless, his father will finally understand the immorality of his work and do good to the old man seeking work.
Now I'm betting on myself - if the film is happy, I'll reward my insights after the movie with coffee, but if I'm wrong, the screenist can be praised for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there's a suspicion that I'm missing coffee... when my husband calls Dane from the hospital... and he's rushing down the hall.
Rather, the son is wonderfully cured, and even though his father has just lost his job, it is also positive, because now it is time to deal with the family.
I can feel good too - I can predict the end of American drama quite well!
When the truth is given credit, the film is well-designed, all the elements necessary for it exist.
Can cry, can laugh, actors are good and moral beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I'm sure this movie's gonna be great.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to limit the president's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
Then he'd be the first.
Politico writes that the new head of staff of the White House is planning to limit the information flow to President Trump, including the news, in the hope that it will keep the boss in a better water.
Here's a broken reporter from Josh Dawsey:
"When the new head of staff of the White House, John F. Kelly, met high-level officials on his first working day, he highlighted the key problem at President Donald Trump's White House, which he was planning to solve in the President's hands.
Kelly told the officials that the information had to go through her, whether on paper or at meetings, because the president would make better decisions if they shared good information."
Kelly's diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have tried to do it, and they failed to control Trump's media use.
President Trump's relationship with television lasts decades, and now that he's in the White House, he hasn't gone anywhere.
"If the candidate Trump was upset about the dishonest media coverage, it was worth showing him that he was genuinely reflected in the publications he was affected," said former campaign advisor Sam Nunberg to Politico in February.
Politico Tara Palmer wrote at the time that "six former campaigners said that the key to managing the Twitter habits of Trump is to ensure that his personal media consumption also contains a song of praise".
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter usage has ever been "controlled" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don't know Trump's sparks would have been even more exhilarating without their intervention.
We'll probably never know about the sparks Trump didn't post.
If his assistants could save him even a few times from trouble, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from constantly creating the issue.
Part of the problem is that people in the White House, consisting of competing clicks, are trying exclusively to promote their own interests by providing Trump with material that supports their outlook, but may not always be reliable.
In May, Politico wrote information about the tendency of the advisors to feed the President of the Feed at strategically questionable values.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
"Practices and former Trump subjects say that Trump can react to negative press, especially harmful information leaks, explosively, by becoming obsessed with the detection of their source.
This was the case at the end of February when someone gave the President a copy of the article of the web provocative Charles C. Johnson web site GotNews.com, which accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being a "source of multiple information leaks".
It doesn't matter whether Johnson's been permanently blocked from Twitter because of the abuse, or that he didn't offer any concrete evidence, or that he's made false accusations in the past and withdrawn them.
Trump read the article and began asking about Walsh under the command."
Goldmacher added that at the time, the head of the Reince Priebus and the White House Office, Rob Porter "has tried to establish a system for the management and documentation of documents arriving at Trump".
How did that work?
Kelly's trying to do exactly the same three months later.
He may be a more effective leader from Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These unaltered factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from abroad do not get permission to perform.
There are a lot of foreigners in the city centre of Tallinn to play music.
Those with whom the magazine was discussed admitted to playing in the Old Town without city government permission.
First, we found three street musicians near Viru Gates who had taken as many dogs with us.
It was clearly evident that musicians with rascals and broken clothes were backpack travelers who could use a shower for a berry.
Despite the appearance, the only woman in the company played a story with fun rhythms, while a man next to her played with three balls and invited passers closer.
The third man had sat next to them on a backpack and the peace of heart smoked himself into a screw - up stick.
Their three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the passing people.
Bob, who played the chorion with Noem and the balls, told me that they were kissing on the streets for fun and money.
The aim of the company’s performance was to collect ticket money for a ship travelling to Finland on the same day.
The question is, did they ask the city for permission to kiss in the old town, shaked Noem's head and Bob's head?
First of all, we didn't know.
Secondly, we will never stay in one city for more than a day or two, and mostly permits for a month or something like that.
There's no point in paying for this," Bob explained.
When we got back to the Viru gates about 20 minutes later, we saw two women at the musicians and drive them away.
The company moved in with backpacks and dogs to try luck at the crossing of the Viru Centre.
Three Polish young men were also present on the street of Viru, one of whom played violin, the other clarinet, and the third had brought an electronic piano.
"We are here to give people entertainment to spread music and joy and to earn money for fuel and for living," explained Trio pianist Mivosh.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware that there must be city government permission to perform.
"Of course we don't have it," he said with a joke.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there will be no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we go somewhere else, but we have to try," he added.
Eesti Pank purchased 149 million euro bonds in the framework of the public asset purchase programme of the euro area central banks, while the central bank's debt portfolio increased to 4.36 billion euros in July.
The central bank shall not publish any more detailed information on purchases.
The President of Eesti Pank Hardo Hansson has previously explained that the Eurosystem central banks' asset purchase plan covers three different purchasing programmes: covered bonds in the financial sector, asset-backed bonds (ABS) and government bonds (PSPP).
The central bank buys bonds from the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere.
Purchases will result in lower-risk asset yields and will motivate investors to take higher risks.
As a general rule, in the framework of the public bond purchase programme, each central bank buys its government bonds, and other government bonds are not purchased.
Since the Estonian State has not issued bonds, Eesti Pank will make so-called buy-in within the limits of the allocated volume.
Replacement purchases are also carried out by central banks in those countries where the offer of debt corresponding to the purchase plan is limited.
According to Hansson, Eesti Pank usually buys bonds from European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank.
Eesti Pank will purchase bonds under the asset purchase programme as of March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering's bonds were also purchased, but since June 2016, Eesti Pank will no longer buy Elering's bonds.
From June, Elering and Eesti Energia will buy bonds from the Finnish central bank on behalf of the euro area central banks.
Travelers ignore the ditch and return to the “Millions ” districts
Some of the richest homeowners in the West Midlands have once again become violently opposed to determined travelers who have ignored the ditch dug by the council to win back the field that is not in their villas.
Travelers have parked their 20 trailer summers outside of a wealthy "millionaire district" crucified near Solihull Street.
They have returned with the army of horses, children, and trucks since they were only kicked out in May, without having to get involved in the ditch that was dug up by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical team found a weak spot within the protection limits by squeezing their vehicles through an uninhibited section that had been left on the road.
The people who are angry are cursed by the Solihull Council, saying that the Council is "unprofitable to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on a Monday night after their exorcism from Bentley Heathis, where they threw stones at passers.
The Council must be ashamed to take action because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were driven away, and now they're back again.
There were more of them last night, probably even more of them today."
He added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such matters by obtaining long barriers to the protection of its parks.
I live on the Streetsbrook, and I'm not satisfied that I have to continue to pay the council tax if the council can't even stop such a thing."
A local resident who also wanted to remain anonymous said, "It's ridiculous. We just saw the last of these travelers leaving, and a new attack is already taking place.
This time the number has grown, and the grassland has even been seen recollecting the horse."
The representative of the Solihull Council said: "We are aware that there is an unacceptable camp site in the country near the Streetsbrook Road, and we are working with the Solihull Police, and we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them to move as quickly as possible.
The collection of evidence will be very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling number 101.
This will help to create a picture of the situation for the court if we present the case to them."
The Weekly Festival is also visited by the Minister of Culture Indrek Saar, who is pleased that real world top names have been brought to Estonia.
The question why the Weekly Festival is so important to Estonians is answered by the Saar, that it should be asked of all those who enjoy the three days of the festival in full.
However, he will admit that real people have arrived in Pärnu.
"While looking at the level of artists that have been able to be brought to Estonia, the Minister of Culture says that the absolute titles of this music genre will be brought home.
What are some of the artists who perform at the festival most talk about themselves?
I think I'm a relatively old man, and for old people like me, I'm sure it's one of the most experienced artists, Armin van Buuren, who stepped up last night.
According to his CD rotation, all of us have been running their own feet at some point," he says.
However, he will bring out a number of names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our own Estonian producers too: starting with NO'P and reading them can be read in a whole series.
In fact this well-known name concentration is very high," he says.
Take a closer look at the Evening Week video!
Audi updates up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the middle of the criticisms of car manufacturers
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW said that it offers software supplementation for more than 350 000 vehicles.
According to the chairman of BMW, the company believes that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including the city of Munich, which has considered prohibiting or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that he would renew three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce exhaust emissions from diesel engines.
No company described these activities as recalling.
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the CO2 emission regulations.
However, nitrogen oxide from diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and may cause asthma.
The cost of equipment to be installed to neutralise exhaust emissions from diesel vehicles for automotive companies will also increase, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under in-depth investigation, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of spoiling powerful car manufacturers and of ignoring the signs of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen's errors, which silenced the use of deceiving devices that allowed the exhaust gas reading to be adapted to the regulations by the time the car was tested, but withdrew under normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States and others have been investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the thermodynamics sub-unit of the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former President Zachcheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may go to trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was dragged to a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany when the authorities accused the audit of installing the system to circumvent the requirements of European emissions, thereby expanding the investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
The involvement of the Audi in the investigation may be a major blow for Volkswagen by the manufacturer of luxury cars generates a disproportionately large proportion of Volkswagen's profits.
Estonian schools will receive European Union flags for 20 000 euros.
By 1 September, the Ministry of Education intends to buy EU flags for Estonian schools to mark the Presidency.
A total of 105x158 cm will receive 570 educational institutions of the European Union flag.
The flags are intended to be exposed in indoor spaces; they must be carried out in high-quality printing equipment in indoor spaces with tunnel fixing, the ERR news portal shall be transmitted.
The label of the flagvarda contains the text: "The condition for Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Estonian Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of 570 tickets is EUR 20 000 at the Ministry of Education’s price, or one ticket costs EUR 35.
The murder of a journalist emphasizes a growing state of danger in Mexico
The employees of the week magazine Riodoce usually gather on Wednesdays to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the State of Sinaloa sown by organised crime, corrupt officials and incestuous drug wars.
But today they are gathered in the shadow of personal tragedy to discuss their own security.
They're told it's important to change their routines.
Two senior writers will discuss which one seems safer: either bring the children to an office that was the target of the grenade attack in 2009 or leave them home.
Security experts have written three words on the board at the top of the room: "enemies", "negatives", "allies".
They ask reporters in each column to provide names that do not need proof, enough impressions and feeling.
The government's or cartel's employees suspect drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists a whole list of bad guys who make it dangerous to capture chaos in Mexico.
There are no break in the spirit of violence, and the more corpses are gathering across the country, the majority of which, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, have since the oath of President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012 at least 25,589 journalists have been killed after attacks and threats under national protection, and during that year at least seven journalists in seven states have been killed.
The latter include their editor and source of inspiration, the co-founder of Riodoce, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence gives a deep sense, although his presence can be perceived anywhere in the Fascate of the Riodoce building hangs a large picture of the average finger-showing Valdez with a letter of "Justice" and two reporters in the 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts that show his smiled face or a co-cooperative hat.
The meeting will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporters will discuss a common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate public prosecutor’s office was set up in 2010 to deal with cases involving journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only two cases have been committed to judicial responsibility.
Like most annual drug trafficking and organised crime murders, which reach thousands, the killers of journalists rarely go to court.
Riodoce continues to reflect violence in Sinalo, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security meeting is of little use without the information and justice of the killers.
"It's really silly to waste your time at this meeting," he says.
"Until there's a reason you don't believe everyone."
Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan, the capital of the state, on 15 May.
He only managed to drive a couple of blocks before two men stopped him from red Tokyo Corolla, forced to get out of the car and shot him 12 times, probably because of the newspaper's name, which translates into "the twelfth river".
An armed man drove away in Valdez's car and crashed near it.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was left behind by a woman and two adult children.
Rumours spread freely in Culiacan.
However, Valdez is mostly about silence.
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and the execution of the United States in January, Sinalo has been one of the bloodiest fields in the country because rival clicks are fighting for the execution of the power vacuum.
No matter how many people or even more are shot every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or how the cemetery is full of decorated double-dwelling drug kings’ mausoleums that are larger than the homes of many living.
Let us forget for a moment that the time of peace refers to the fact that, with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States, there is only one cartel running the maritime state.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers involved in his work, the co-founder and manager of Riodoce, Ismail Bojorquez (60), feels enormous guilt that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes contributed to the killing.
The first of these was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the snore of the Guzman cartel, which competes with the sons of Guzman.
This book could have pissed off the boys by suspected gang members buying copies of all the publications as soon as they got to the newspaper shops.
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after the raid took place in another newspaper editor who reflected the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing was seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked for Noroeste in 2003 as a veteran reporter when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling $50 units.
Bojorquez said that Sinaloas "was impossible to deal with the press without touching the drug problem."
In time, the newspaper gained a reputation with its bold and honest reflections, and sales and advertising grew.
The reporters liked to publish powerful studies without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated in a print that they could read stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, the newspaper won its Latin American reflections for the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize.
In the same year, the Valdez Committee for the Protection of Journalists (AKK) won the International Prize for Freedom of the Press for its courage to follow the Mexican Narcotics wherever it takes it.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the AKK Prize.
Last October, he told the TV network that drug trafficking was a way of life in Sinaloa.
"You have to accept the task that comes with the press department's second chance to play dumb.
I don't want to be asked what I did when I faced so many deaths or why I didn't tell you what was happening."
The Riodoce collective misses Valdez, a joker, who rocked like a sailor, a friend who kindly shared emblems and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They supported his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from the office to the El Guayabo bar and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if his routine love became fatal to him.
His death has also made them doubt how to do their job best and to stay alive.
"They don't like it when you smite their women, their children, their legitimate business, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs."
"These things were not to be touched," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best of times, is strong self - control and self - control.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
Riodoce's editor, Andres Villarreal, says that the problem is that "the sense of smell can be deceived... and that's how it happened to Javier."
He and others say that Sinalos no longer apply the old rules, just as they do not apply to the toxic association of Tamaulipas, Vladimir, Guerrero and other states, which are home to profitable smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The landscape is changing constantly.
In a room where Riodoce’s staff met for security training, mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed; a few days before that, it was revealed that only the spyware sold to governments had been used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists.
In front of the house, two policemen were looking for relief from 40 degrees of heat in the tree.
The government appointed them to guard the Riodoce office, located in a four-storey building in the Culiacan middle class neighbourhood.
Some reporters were half wondering if these police officers belonged to the 50 percent of the police officers whose governor himself has identified as unreliable.
Several months have passed since the reporters have traveled to mountain areas where control is de facto held by drug gangs.
Riodoce’s edition of this week covered three main stories.
One of them was the murder of former boxing agent Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinalo.
In addition, they had an revealing story of spending government money on the governor's hometown.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a quarter from the D.A.'s office.
There was no official statement about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution had to be taken when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows is a place of pleasure for both drug traffickers and public authorities.
The reporter learned from the public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician who belongs to the institutional Revolutionary Industries (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century.
Recently, several IRP governors have been accused of corruption in large-scale cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about the previous incidents in the same place, including how El Chapo's son Guzman, carrying Guzman, was released from the army.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have looked for Valdez’s column to get information about the kidnapping from the best sources.
"We would have already known what happened," said the 46-year-old Villarrea, whose cleenuke bodybuilding has earned her a nickname called El Flaco.
"Now all communication channels have broken with our sources."
Valdez's office has become a storage room for labels and stickers that protest against the killing of journalists, and the staff of the editors have become something that they could never expect activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez picked up a couple of signs and headed to the local prosecutor’s office for a demonstration about another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after the murder of Valdez.
The body was found burned and the officials said it belongs to him based on DNA tests.
Journalists across the country have become more loud and criticise the phrase "SOS press" as an organised protest for walkways and buildings.
On this day, President Bojorquez will be in Washington trying to collect international support for bringing justice to justice in the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez died, when he met the governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
After that, he asked that he be directed from government to other parts of the world, worrying that his anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are organised by crime, co-indicate state officials and an indifferent society "restricted".
He wrote in his last book on Drugs Journalism that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also by order of politicians and security forces who are in the middle of organised crime.
Last year, more than half of the media attacks on police and public officials were attributed to the Articulo 19 media.
"You're dying in Mexico because they want you quiet," said Ramirez.
The murders are obviously blood-staining.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in Tamaulipais, northern border state six years ago.
His body was found with a letter probably signed by the cartel Los Zetas, "I'm here because of my reports."
The computer keyboard and the headphones were lying next to the head that was cut off.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua following the killing of their correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue as El Manana de Nuevo Laredo committed the murder of their leader in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke with the public front-row "What do you want from us?".
Some journalists are displaced from their home states or even from the country.
It's a nervous decision.
It's hard to find a job in Exile, and they still have to hide the streets in order to avoid the dangers.
And sometimes they are pursued, as probably happened to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in 2015 in one apartment in Mexico three months after he was banished.
Those who stay and continue to work must dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, testifies to the fact that he's scared to reflect on the drug business.
"Mexico's on his way to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
In the middle of a recent Friday night, when the latest number had already been locked, Riodoce’s editors sat in front of the office on the sidewalk and drank beer when suddenly everyone’s phones began to vibrate.
In Mazatlan, a coastal resort town, 19 people were killed in the exchange of fires between rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued to flourish, as a number of cartels found in the region promised the message left.
Right on the side of the walkway, reporters placed news on the Riodoce website using a mobile phone.
The front of the next day needed a change.
The sirens set off another exchange of fire in the area.
Bojorquez was spying on police officers to see if they were on guard.
Even if they were afraid, they didn't show it at all.
Under the massive portrait of the founder of the newspaper, on which his average finger is visible to all of Sinaloa, Riodoce’s workers carried him in his footsteps.
"How can I even think about closing," said Bojorquez, "if the same day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send him to the streets for a report?"
Dinosaurus used a protective color to prevent enemies
At first glance, it seems like a figure, though pretty scary.
Scientists have now revealed their first findings regarding the incredible rhinoceros size found by the Canadian miner, which is so well preserved that experts have described it as "the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs".
It is still so well preserved that it was even possible to detect that her skin covered with scales was reddish brown and her past had been somewhat "complicated".
The report published in Current Biology described the entity as "the best preserved solo dinosaur that has ever been found" and as "one of the best dinosaurs in the world".
Fossil is a new species of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the crucifix, 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation of open scientists who describe it as "truely significant".
According to the National Geographic magazine, this armored vegetarian is the best preserved of this type of fossil that has ever been found.
It was found on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk when he mined Suncor Millenium in the mine near Fort McMurray in North Albert, Canada.
He caught something that did not resemble the surrounding stone, and he decided to study more closely.
The found fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
For the next six years, it was worked out to dig the animal out of a leg of 2500 pounds (1100 kg).
After all this hard work, the final result is now ready to be presented to the public.
"If you look at him a little bit, you can almost believe he's sleeping," said the leading author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is exposed.
"It goes into scientific history as one of the most beautiful and most preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
As they examined his skin, the researchers found that this vegetarian, although covered with swamps and reminded of walking tanks, was likely to be significantly threatened by meat - fed dinosaurs.
This large - scale dinosaur used a red and white color to hide from predators, and applied a concealment technique called anti-spam, which is also used by many modern - day animals.
According to experts, this enabled dinosaurs to blend better into the surrounding area and avoid enemies as larger dinosaurs were likely to hunt him.
This 110 - million - year - old Nodosaur family creature came into the news for the first time in May and is now visiting the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
Researchers have now studied the subject and named it Borealopella Markmichelli’s laboratory, Mark Mitchell, who belonged to a team that spent more than 7,000 hours trying to expose the animal.
Thanks to the amazing maintenance of the individual, Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the armour on the animal's body.
They discovered the method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the upper half of the creature was darker than the lower half.
Although the resistance is widespread, the findings come as a surprise, since Borealopella is far greater than the animals living today with the resistance.
This suggests that dinosaurs were sufficiently active in hunting other carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution preferd the shadow rather than the resistance to survival.
However, most animals using modern resistance - e.g. deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that nodosaurus had to work to survive.
"The powerful hunting of dinosaurs covered with enormously large and large scales shows how dangerous the crystallized dinosaurs could be," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of the organic salts also revealed that dinosaur skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal to get clues about its life, including its remains in the intestines, to find out what the animal was eating for its last meal.
They believe that dinosaurs fell into the river in death, thereby reaching the sea with a current where they sank in front of the ocean floor.
At that time Alberta was as warm as currently in South Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely to reach far further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaurus is truly significant, because it is completely covered with preserved armory skin, while it remains also three-dimensional, preserving the original form of the animal," Brown said.
"As a result, the animal today looks almost the same as in the age of criticism.
To rebuild it, you don't have to use a lot of imagination - it's enough to just squeal your eyes and it seems like he's sleeping."
The time of the crisis was when huge dinosaurs, two - footed - footed dinosaurs, traveled on Earth.
Although their King Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borealope, some of his fearsome predecessors could hunt this armored dinosaur.
These include Acracanthosaurus, 38 feet (11.5 meters) long and six tons tall.
Scientists, whose recent findings are published in Current Biology, believe that Borealopella was washed after death into the sea and it was mummification in the mud.
On 21 March 2011, the alien discovered Shawn Funk when he mined the Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in North Albert, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armour in the world, including skin and scales, and it is a complete condensation from the hips.
These creatures were on average 18 feet (5 metres) long and weighed up to GBP 3000 (300 kg).
Two 20 - inch - long squirrels broke out of its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this protagonist, covered with scales, adventured through the present Western Canada until the flooded river sank into its open sea.
However, the underwater burial site of dinosaur helped to maintain its ideally detailed scales.
The stoned remains of this particular individual have been so well preserved that the remains of the skin are still covered by the mythical ribs along the dinosaur’s skulls.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic Journal: "This degree of preservation is as rare as lottery victory.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
Tissued skin residues continue to cover the mythical ribs on the animal’s skull.
The right foreleg lies next to him, and five toes are stretched upwards.
I can count the scales on her winter."
How did one activist find the answer to the question "Who's the streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell received a complete shock.
Just the day after traveling to New York, it sat on Facebook via St. Louis’s resident Airbnb in a rented room.
She ended up in her former schoolmate's post.
It says, "Police just killed an 18-year-old kid and she's still on the street."
He was confused why no one else had posted this information in his stream, which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The length of @TheePharoah user posts was repeatedly distributed in his timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis region delivered a real-time sparkle of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man killed by a white police officer in Missouri Ferguson.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street staying there for four hours.
"This is crazy," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
He hung up on his phone, but later this evening he saw again a spark that reported the gathering of people on Canfield Drive this time.
They shared photos of the police tape and screaming people, and of the man who claimed to be Brown's father, and kept the sign "Ferguson Police Just Killed My Unarmed Son!"
He was looking at the real-time currents where the police were standing in front of a protestor group with a dog in the grave.
In the second video, another police officer moaned a gun and screamed, "I'm gonna kill you all... animals."
Ferrelli remembers how she caught herself thinking, "It's unusual."
"It's not the kind of murder we're used to and we could call typical."
I used to feel a lot of creeps at the moment.
I was angry and crying."
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
After landing at 23 o’clock, he went to see his father for his six - year - old daughter and decided that they would be driving alone the next morning.
What happened to Ferrelli and Ferguson in the next three years is the central theme in the new documentary "Whose Street?" "Who's Streets?" that premieres in cinemas on 11 August.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and hardship for those who live in this community and who filled in the answers in demanding thanks.
When Ferrell and his daughter, wearing a flower dress and headed for a crown suitable for it, again spoke about the experience and living conditions of the black people before this morning.
"Do you remember when I taught you how a black community had to fight for their rights?" she recalls asking.
"We're driving to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right."
"I couldn't take him with me," said Ferrell later.
"What's happening right now is... "the culmination of the past.
He needs to know and see and grow in the middle of it.
He must learn about activistism and organisation, and at the same time he must know the different layers of black experience and living conditions, and what we must do to get free and free ourselves.
Even if I succeed in raising him so that he does not experience personally arrogant racism, he does not differ from another black girl.
I feel like I'd be doing him a hard-on if I were to protect him from this world."
The first stop they made when they arrived at Ferguson was on the south of Florissant - in a place that remained across the street, which had become a camp site of some kind, where activists were waiting for news of Officer Darren Wilson, who was finally not charged.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with the local business owner who made lunches.
They put together food bags and helped distribute them to protestors.
For Ferrelli, a new type of activist slowly began to take shape.
"My activist changed completely after August 9," he said, pointing out that when he was a Missouri-St. He was a student at the University of Louis, he was president of the Association of Minorities Nursing Students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no organisational experience.
It all worked out."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, co-director of a film during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and the film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar simply wanted to document what was happening.
Ferrelli said, "Are you trying to document what's happening or find a story that can be used?"
Such scepticism was caused by countless cases of people - often white - coming into the community and trying to reap the benefits of their pain and endurance.
In the recent interview, Folayan explained: "We have heard that the voice of people born and raised in Ferguson is not being heard and we wanted to do so differently."
Folayan had already struck hands with co-director Damon Davis, an artist of the region known for his activistism in connection with prisoners sentenced to death.
His involvement made the project binding for Ferrelli and six other locals who were watched by the film "Whose Streets"?
"No one in this documentary speaks for us or for us, but we speak for ourselves," Davis said.
"It was important for me how these people were portrayed, because so am I."
Although the aim was not to focus on Ferrelli's experience - they wanted to show that the movement was not a "responsible guide, but a community assembly", as Folayan said - he became the most open part of the film.
As a result, "Whose Street"? surprisingly documents personal aspects of Ferrelli's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing at the first time he saw the sheetwork.
"But I realized that doing this work and humanising black people must be accompanied by certain vulnerability."
Furthermore, Ferrelli's story emphasizes and refocuss the role of a black homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three initiators of the movement who thought out the theme references #BlackLivesMatter after killing the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 are homosexual.
"The leading role of black homosexual women has been to keep the movement in general," said Ferrell, "and that is precisely because we have to fight constantly on several fronts.
Black homosexual women must carry this whole burden."
Folayan agreed, stating that 'mobility is indeed maintained by black women and many of them are black homosexual women'.
He also claims that "this is not something of a type of equal opportunities" - Ferrelli was not selected as the focus of the film because of his identity.
"He was the person who blew up the right energy," he said.
"But it's not a coincidence that he was right on the front line, because as a black homosexual woman living in such nodes, there's a lot at stake.
His energy can be perceived through the screen."
At the same time, news cameras have long since disappeared from Ferguson, but racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile.
The probationary sentence imposed on Ferrelli during the demonstration for blocking the road will last for another 2.5 years.
He describes a social policy atmosphere in an area he calls home, just a "frozen grass".
Nevertheless, he still attaches great importance to the mantra that he has been corroding since he went to Ferguson streets whole three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains."
7 drops of how to get past the North after the Weekly Party
Some of the toughest male boys will find, after a close party, that what's wrong is helpful.
Or they're like, "you know, hang on, stay drunk."
But it's just an inevitable delay and a proper health test.
What can you do to feel better in the morning and to get over the hangover as painless as possible after tonight and tomorrow?
Drink water.
Alcohol down and on, after a big party in the morning... or, if possible, instead of alcohol.
Since the body loses a lot of fluid when drinking alcohol, it has to be restored somehow.
Minerals are also washed out of the body with water and it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often irritable after a drink, it is especially good if it is bubble-free or just slightly agitated.
Go for a walk.
I'm sure you wouldn't want to go to Grandma's with a hangmell and break trees - it could be a fatal decision.
But a light walk helps the body to remember again what it feels like to be alive.
Lying in tents and hanging out with a hangover is a more time-consuming way of getting better.
Give the body energy back slowly and carefully.
If you're already throwing up from last night's drinking, I'm sure you don't want to try loading a big fat roast.
Start with, for example, fresh juice, which contains fruit sugars that are slowly marketed in your body.
If you already suffer from health problems around the south, you might want to try a broth, for example.
And a little bit later on the back.
Avoid the coffee.
This diuretics will release your body from the last water.
As I've already said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you are taking a painkiller to prevent a hangmell in the evening, your liver will have to deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol and will lose your performance.
So you break your liver even more, and there will be even worse things in the future.
In addition, the painkiller does not stay in the body for long anyway.
If you're taking a painkiller in the morning, don't do it with an empty stomach - it'll upset your already dirty stomach.
Or if you don't have a partner, you'll be fine with yourself.
It works about the same way as walking, but walking does not get an orgasm.
However, avoid being too active and crazy to pose — during the hangover, physical effort should be moderate.
You gotta be kidding me.
Make a stupid talk with your friends and colleagues, make simple nonsenses, and laugh friendlyly at yourself and others (sponsors).
Laugh and laughter may not be fun, but it is certainly more fun to endure the consequences with them.
Once in a while, it's going to go all the way over the floor!
Professor of Northwest and employee at Oxford University are wanted for murder as suspects.
According to the police, a nationwide search is being made for a professor at the University of Northwestern and an employee at the University of Oxford, who has become suspects since a man with deadly stab wounds found a body in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
According to Cook County's judicial documents, arrest warrants for the arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren were issued on Monday for the alleged connection with the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the records, the 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeated injection.
According to a warning issued by the Chicago Police Department to the community, the body was discovered on July 27.
The police got a phone call and found a victim in front of the Grand Plaza apartment building with several stab wounds on it.
According to the officials, at the Cornell-Duranleau scene, he was declared dead and the investigators consider stabbed as murder, while the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as co-professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Northwestern since 2007.
In his e-mail statement, Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President of the University of Public Relations, said that Lathem has now been temporarily suspended and that he is prohibited from entering the cities of the University of Northwest.
"It is now a criminal case for competent authorities, and the University of Northwestern is working with the investigators," said Cubbage.
Warren is a senior general in the financial department at Oxford University.
In an e-mail statement from the University and Somerville College, the representative said: "We have been in contact with the British police and are prepared to assist US research institutions in any way possible."
In addition, the statement stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to turn himself in.
Anthony Guglimelim, head of the Chicago Police Department Communications Department, urges suspects to turn themselves in to the authorities.
"Police has an idea where they're staying, but we're working on defining the exact location more and more intensively," said Guglimell.
According to Guglimel, the suspects will be helped to search for local, regional and national authorities.
Guglimelmi said that the police received a phone call from the Grand Plaza apartment building manager, who had just received a cryptic indication that something had happened in apartment 1008.
According to the police's description, it was a magic sight.
According to Guglilid, it is not clear whether the event itself took place on 27 July.
He said security cameras confirmed Lathem and Warren staying in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim were having an affair," Guglimill added.
The Grand Plaza administration sent a letter to the residents: "Police is currently working on establishing the history of events and the background of the victim, and is investigating various motives, including the possibility that it was a family member."
Start-up companies that help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of the employees in her e-commerce start-up company, but the polls were unprofitable.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some workers did not trust this process.
"This system was simply not consistent and objective," said Errett, who runs Madison Reed, an e-commerce company selling hair care products with 75 employees in San Francisco.
So he called for help from outside persons.
New types of human resources start-ups are becoming important to help companies find out what their employees are feeling.
By developing and licensing software with a firm aim of measuring employee involvement, they allow companies to conduct sudden surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide workers with anonymity and a hot line of complaints and, in some cases, allow language carriers to go along level C managers and turn directly to the board.
"Now there are tools such as Strava and Fitbit, which are designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit to your company?" asked Jim Barnett, the co-chair and CEO of Redwood City's start-up company, Glint, whose software analysis tools are used by companies to measure employee involvement.
According to Merett, he has received a much better view of what his employees think and feel over three years of using Glint.
In addition to the sudden research and specific team surveys, it provides a company's heat map, which gives an overview of the department's number of complaints and which managers have the lowest support, enabling them to identify the reasons.
Businesses have come to realize that they must keep up with their work culture so that they do not become the next Uber that has been repressed into scandals since the former employee published a blog mail that described a distressing environment in which those who dared to speak were punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, the desire to have an overview is a profitable business opportunity.
According to Let's Talk Payments, the global governance, regulation and compliance area can be worth more than $ 118.7 billion by 2020, according to the Financial Technology Statistics website.
A start-up company in Denver Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour, this year Uber observed an increase in interest and activity in the background of suspicious reputation.
Convertcent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a client.
As with Glintki, Convertent lets companies send customized pulse surveys, collect real-time confidential answers and view heat maps from problematic areas.
It also provides an anonymous communication line allowing workers to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when the chief executive is involved, the complaints go directly to the board.
"The public opinion has been taken by regulatory authorities," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of the Convercent.
Quinlan said that if it is found that the company is mistreating or conducting its employees, the company may face serious consequences, such as consumer boycotts, workers leaving and cases, even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in 500 establishments, has used Convertent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the rules and operations and provide an easy way to communicate with the corporate headquarters.
If the employee wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find the phone number or email address of the corporate headquarters, make an official complaint and hope that it is taken seriously.
This was often a distressing and uncomfortable process, said General Adviser Ruby Tuesday James Vitrano, who said that there was no good way to follow complaints from employees.
However, now that the company uses Convercent, problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices, which have not previously reached the leaders who were active in offices in other cities or states, can be identified and dealt with more quickly.
"I can get closer to the holyistic 360-degree experience of employees," said Vitrano, who is leading Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"And we protect our shareholders from legal disputes with the employees."
Quinlan said that companies began to take ethical behaviour, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, i.e. after the audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations in connection with Enron's scandal.
But only when "social media got ripe", the companies realized that they could not prevent their black laundry from being washed publicly online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behavior, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convertcent offer their software as a service, taking a periodic fee from companies for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity for the approval of venture capital investors, which has supported both start-ups.
In February, Convercent financed $10 million in companies such as the Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, thus increasing the value of the collected capital to 47 million.
In November, Glint invested $10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners, increasing the company's total budget to $60 million.
Such investments will not come as a surprise if account is taken of the relationship between companies, culture and venture capital.
More studies show that modern workers expect more from the workplace than before.
In competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just the stakes on the table.
Employees want to feel accepted and appreciated and devoted their time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy in the company, they feel that they are being listened to and that the work they do is satisfying, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company," Nina McQueen said, who is Vice President LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn income if the companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when the employees are committed and involved.
If the third-party analytical tools allow workers to increase their commitment and involvement, it is no wonder that they will be supported.
The possession of data on employee involvement is, according to the professional culture experts, important.
However, these data will be useless if the company supervisors do not follow them.
In fact, if the company asks for feedback from its employees, it can create expectations that there will be changes.
And if changes do not take place quickly enough or not at all, this can lead to disappointment and a reduction in employee involvement.
"If you ask 4000 proposals, you must be ready for 4000 conversations," said Kotter International President Russell Raath of the consulting and business management company, who has seen how companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
'Cause if things aren't finished, the employees are thinking, 'Did you actually hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?"
According to Verett, Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly surveys among employees, has been able to implement measures on the same day as the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from workers who were disappointed in the speed of decision-making and quality of communication, he was able to reorganise several teams in the company and provide communication training to deal with problems.
However, Ruby Tuesdays is collecting new data on workers and it is expected that in the long term, it will lead to workers' long-term commitment in an industry known for their high labour flow.
"If you are not committed to ensuring transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies."
The brightest star in the euro area is the Baltic: incomes are growing rapidly
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic States, the three Baltic countries are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries in Western Europe, Bloomberg writes in reference to the report of the European Central Bank.
According to the central bank, since 1999, total economic output per capita has exceeded expectations in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
Progress is driven by a low debt burden, rapidly improving institutions and business and free market policies.
"Baltic countries are among the few euro area countries where real GDP per capita has significantly approached the EU average," the central bank announced.
Although the aim is to ensure that total economic output per capita is equal to that of western Europe, in 2015, the total production per capita of the Baltic economies was only 2/3 of the 15 countries that belonged to the European Union before the 2004 enlargement.
Low wages have led the Baltics to look for better wages abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is growing this year, the local people are not enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of Latvian and Lithuanian citizens estimated that their economies were doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, it was slightly less than half of those surveyed about their economies.
The decision of the NCAA to cancel the exercise twice a day makes Bruins' days long
It's almost 23, when the UCLA football team stops for a chat on the edge of a new training course in the team's campus.
Some of them have peeled off their shirts, revealing the sweaty back of their training camp’s first day efforts.
For a large part of the team, these forcefuls offer a midday break.
Players in summer courses will go back after three hours to study for final exams at the joint school before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6.30 a.m. the next morning.
"The next three days are a real challenge for them," said Bruins coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The decision of the NCAA to cancel the exercise of players twice a day has actually made their days longer - at least until the end of the exams on Friday.
For this reason, UCLA’s first three trainings were scheduled to begin at 19.15 to fit into the already close schedule of players.
The transition from two trainings per day means more days with one exercise - the start of the Bruins training camp was increased to almost a week ahead of the previous season and for the first time during the six Westwood seasons of Mora.
They will have up to 20 August scheduled 18 exercises before the official preparation for the opening game in September against Texas A&M.
According to Mora, she is in favour of a change in the NCAA rules, although it adds another agenda item to the tight charts of players.
"These three or four days have a huge burden and this is a serious challenge," Mora said.
"And they will break through this trial; they will work hard, they will be good young.
I believe that when Saturday arrives and we have more time, it'll be really fun."
Once the camp is completed, UCLA’s trainings will be closed, which is not an easy task, given a clear view of the nearby parking area and the adjacent Luski Centre, from a high-class hotel that has already been hit by football that has passed the gate-post protection net.
From this weekend, Bruins’ players are occupied, but Mora admitted that problems can arise during the season with free rooms.
"Let's implement security measures," Mora said.
"This is a real concern and is not exaggerated to think that people can rent a room and film training there.
If you have a record of your training, you can make a pretty good deal with it.
But we're gonna use a security team on that and 8th parking lot.
We'll do our best to make use of what we have.
I'm trying not to worry about it.
We have a plan."
The Electoral Union of Savisaare-Ivanova, Kristiina Ojuland, which was born in the centre party, and Maria Kaljuste, who was forced out of the Reform Party, to join forces of the EKRE, to show our Tallinn-party electoral union, Actus Tallinn - it seems that the electoral alliance created in the party policy by an initiative to burn out of the Reform Party will take part in the local elections this year at least as much as the political parties.
But chicks will be considered in the autumn, and the key question will be whether they will all be given enough disappointing voters.
Who's staying with Savisaari?
If Edgar Savisaare's support group has become smaller, it may be possible to imagine the events organised in honor of his election union.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and present political parties and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union?
And is there any reason why some faithful followers and friends of Savisaari avoid running in Tallinn, who are looking for the kidnappers' "List of the Savisaari", led by corrupts and suspected of corruption crimes, becoming a reality?
The music video film filmed on the roof of the city government for the Russian-speaking populace, in which Lasnamäe's senior part of the town; and the primitive computer game, in which the main character, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas, has to avoid the wallets and squirrels on the bike - is this the first time that the Centre Party tries the votes of 16 and 17-year-old voters to be admitted to the electorate?
We look forward to the idea of a young election campaign by other parties.
If, from the beginning of August, the Channel 2 or TV3 viewers are faced with a black square instead of a entertainment show, there are two options: to accept that only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and France24 channels are available in the free future, or to give up every month ten to some television operator.
There are probably also those who, at first, enjoy advertising-free television experience in the public, but in the end - although reluctantly - pay for television and advertising.
Screaming music, loud crowds and garbage left on the streets are the unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
If you don't want to be a part of the noise yourself, it's worth finding your country instead of getting hurt at home, and leaving it at bedtime for the festival guests.
Washington is changing the rules of the Green Card.
The media cite President Donald Trump, who said that a new U.S. immigration plan is planned to change the rules of the Green Card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 people per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and the President supports them.
The bill goes to Congress in two chambers for discussion.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars in taxpayers' money, as it will change the way the US will issue green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and will replace the current programme.
The new application process gives an advantage to candidates who speak English and who have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy," Trump said according to the United States media publications.
The Siberian Seto young people are moving to the city, the pensioners are moving back to the country.
Jevseyev Anatoli continues the tradition of the once famous set of gold miners near the Maana River.
He works as a driver in a gold cartel near the main river, Kuwait, 140 kilometers from home.
It's a tough job: two months in a row without holidays for 12 hours and then only ten days at home and back again.
In the three years worked at Artelli, Anatoli has only seen gold once.
"There's a tough order: when you go in, you check thoroughly that you don't bring the wine, and when you go out so you don't take the gold," says Anatoli.
Mare Piho is speaking to a local Seto Jaan in the village of Haiti, who has told him a lot about the memories of his family in Siberia.
The archaic culture of Siberian Setos, which still remains, will also affect home-sets, because it is simply so amazing, thinks the most profoundly distant setes examined by Piho Mare.
His first study trip to Siberia will be 30 years this year.
During that time, he's been there 14 times and lived there for a year.
How many settled out to Siberia at the end of the 19th and early 20th century to land here?
That's an unsolved question.
I say 8,000.
I calculated it according to the story of the Siberian Seto men who have thought about it.
It is difficult to say, because there were up to 30 people in one group at the time, but the passport was given only to the man.
Pass was given only to one, but with him were children, sisters and other female relatives.
Look at the size of this territory!
It was several times larger than the historical Setomaa.
It had to be educated, managed in some way.
Setos came here as peasants, but their lives changed, because here they came into areas that were not only connected with agriculture, but also with the river (reeling of logs), gold mines, industry.
For example, in New Petersburg, many setos later went to work in a classified city of Krasnojarsk-45 (the Soviet power built the uranium debacle - J.P.) when it was formed.
Did the setos then make up a majority of the population in this region?
Yeah, they lived compactly.
In addition, the tradition of getting married and being a child of many survived for a long time.
Seven or eight children in the family were common.
How much is the culture of Siberian Setos different and different from that of the mother country’s Setos?
They're different, although what was brought here was once the same there.
They brought a lot of folk clothes.
They did so themselves (people), but they always made a distinction between what was brought and what was done here.
Climate change strongly affected the traditional clothing of the Setos, because it's colder here.
Food changed.
For example, meat was salted in Setomaa, but it was just frozen here.

The communication with the motherland was spiritually strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now it's going to give back Seumaa, and it's going to affect them.
Those girls who have lived in these families have been listening to amazing stories.
Piho is referring to the people of the Estonian Seto delegation who came to visit the Haitian Kingdom Day at the beginning of July and lived four days at home - J. P.
What's left here is amazing.
"It is extremely easy to come and go, because the city has an excellent location: at the railway node and at the crossing of the roads," says the operaist Reigo Tamm from Tapa.
The city is not just a military capital anymore, we have plenty of nature, sports and cultural sites, and pizza is available at every corner.
Kill is the top-top city!
There's a small island on the side of the White River running through the city where the killers tend to have a party.
"This beautiful place doesn't look like a train window," Reigo will turn.
Anyone who is not afraid of cold water can swim in the river, because the river is full of resources.
I've been swimming there, I can do it!
You can have a picnic and just do romance on the riverside - you can look at the flow of the river and think about life in front and in the back.
I've been out there walking with my bridesmaids.
The operaist Tamm has been on the riverside between the three bridges, training his arias: "That this place is on the side of the city, no one may come against you if your stories come up."
"There is a wonderful view of Tapa on the mountain, but there are also health lines where you can run, ski in winter, and now play discgolf, for example - the golf course has been made, disks can be rented from a sports centre", directed by Reigo.
The old pros go there with their disks, of course, but I haven't been able to play there yet.
Obviously, my colleague Rasmus Kull must be invited to visit Tapa because he is an experienced disgolfier and has disks.
I think he's lending it to me!
Reigo and Männikämägi were inseparable during the childhood of the current operaisolitist.
At least during the ski sessions.
There's been a lot of tears, disappointments, and you can live in my sport.
Not to mention broken sleighs and skis.
"All the central city is currently full of construction works, all of this will change to the unknown," Reigo says.
However, the kill of an old and tired blind house is a very attractive place to play summer matches.
I am glad that in 2012, the head of R.A.A.A.M. Märt Meos accepted my idea and came with his theatre to make a busy summer theater.
Although this year's theatre season with "Alexei Karenin" has just passed, on August 11, the railway station's "Resurrection" will be on its way around the old blind house in the 1980s.
"Until 11-13 August, Tapa's days are the days of the city of Tapa, which, after waking up the open cafes of the blind room building and taking place in a series of cultural events, including the rallies of the people", Reigo says, who suggests to visit the city from 91 years of age just those days.
In a small yellow cabin, on May 1, the museum is already in 1994.
"The house is small, but the exhibits are very large and the information is enormous," says Reigo, who is full of the history of the City of Tapa, most of which focuses on railways and military.
Reigo recalls that if Tapa goes through all the recommended places, the stomach will soon be empty, but fortunately, the small town will be filled with cafes.
"We have such good places to eat, and sometimes sitting in cafes makes us feel like you're abroad," he describes.
The soldiers who have been educated and young come to Kill spend a lot of time in pubs and cafes, so it is a strange feeling sitting there that you are in Estonia and your hometown, but there is such an international community together.
I believe it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we have a lot of moves!
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The TV channel bTV quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which announced that two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece.
On August 1, the police arrested a group of illegally camping on the peninsula of Sithonia, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but there's an investigation.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told TV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased restrictions on free camping and are already imposing severe fines on all those who are caught on holiday in a place which is not intended to do so.
The checks shall continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose fines.
Puppy-teaching wolves are breaking sheep.
After a year, the Hiiumaa farmers have to take another break from their pack to give wolves "learning material" - probably the wolves who taught puppies have already broken a lot of sheep.
This year, wolves in Hiiu County have broken sheep three times, a total of 23 sheep and injured eight, says Hiiu Leht.
It was only three for me, 124 a year earlier.
The environmental agency's data also show that last year's Hiiumaal were not born wolves, and that the Hiiumaa and the Hiiumaa Board's information that this year two wolves have been established on the island.
On Monday night, the wolves broke 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna, the village of Emmaste, and injured 18 surviving sheep.
In the early morning of Wednesday, wolves broke one sheep in the village of Reheselja and seriously injured another to whom an emergency slaughter had to be carried out.
Rules for the management of genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Development sent a draft law on the introduction of genetically modified organisms into the environment (GMOVS) and on the amendment of the plant protection law to the coordination circle.
The amendment of the law will give up the creation of a separate set of data for both genetically modified (GM) crops and operators and will continue to use a plant health register.
In addition, the GM crop operator's obligation to have a prior agreement with a beekeeper within the prescribed radius shall be amended.
Although there is currently no cultivation of genetically modified crops in Estonia, we believe that clear rules for the co-existence of genetically modified and non-modified crops are necessary.
This was at least until it was decided to declare Estonia GMO-free," said Sigmar Suu, Head of the Department of Plant Health of the Ministry of Life.
"It must also be taken into account that the measures developed must be objectively and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burden of both the private and public sectors", added Suu.
The draft law repeals the provisions relating to the GM's crop establishment and operator's database and management training in GMOs, lays down the requirements for the management of GM crop and the start-up of business activities.
In particular, as regards beekeeping, the obligation of a GM crop grower to inform beekeepers of the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the bee before the start of cultivation is made.
The draft law has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to consult the draft information system and to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Development, if they so wish.
The changes envisaged will affect in particular those active in the field of crop production, beekeepers and the Agriculture Agency.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop - maize MON 810.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in the cultivation of GM crops.
The reason for this is that Estonia does not have a maize pest, a European stalker, against which maize MON 810 is resistant.
The varieties of this maize line are also developed for the southern regions, and this maize is not suitable for our climate conditions.
In 2015 and 2016, the Ministry of Rural Development commissioned studies to detect possible GMOs in the seeds of various varieties of suviraps, maize and soya grown in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain any foreign genes and the study concluded that seeds of rape, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia did not contain genetically modified organisms.
From the above, it can be concluded that Estonia does not deliberately grow genetically modified crops and that there has also been evidence that there has been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United recruits Nemanja Matic in the form of "genius"
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has been recruiting Nemanja Matic in the form of "genius" since the mid-fielder against Sampdor on Wednesday night.
The 40 million-dollar player bought over from Chelsea started a final pre-season game against the Uefa Super Cup Real Madrid in Dublin on Tuesday 2-1 in the first row, with the impression of the defensive role, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to attack.
But after leaving Blues' pre-season Asian tour, Maticul fell short of the fight form and he lasted only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, must be corrected before the Premier League season begins.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, a brilliant mindset - he has a football mood," said Mourinho.
"We'll help him achieve the form as soon as possible."
Like Matic, the other new recruited Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku began to appear at the Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho slowly began to set up his eleven men to begin the season.
The Independent announced this week that Mourinho would still like to recruit three football players, but he confirmed that the club has already done a "great job" by concluding agreements with three of his four priority choices.
"I am grateful to the club that they were able to realize three out of four," he added.
"I'm even happier if they can make four out of four, but they've worked hard for me."
Another son-in-law got his foot on the GSM transmitter on August 1st and this time in Muhu.
According to Mati Martinson, a bird observer living in a deer, Sõrves became the first deaf son with an escort, and this nest is already flying around, has left the nest and joined a large overnight stay group of Mullutu-Suurlahe.
This is because Sõrves is not a cropland, says the Voice of the Islands.
On this Tuesday, to ring the cucumbers relatively late, another deaf son of a bitch was sent to the sender and it was on Muhu Island.
Martinson says that the installation of transmitters is actually an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
A deaf son of a bitch named Mat GSM transmitter was supplied to Sõrves Tõrku.
"His work on the Internet is all watching: how he went to Spain in winter, coming back for a long time at the border between Germany and Poland, and then came to Saaremaa," Martinson spoke.
The British inventor had a microchip installed in his body to get into the house and the car with a handshake.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so that he could open his front only with a handshake, get into the office and even start a car.
33-year-old Steven Northam had a small chip installed between his thumb and index fingers and now offers this service through his company BioTeq for companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, consultant-anesthesiologist at the Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hans, to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of the microchip for cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam’s company also replaces the locks of houses and cars to match the chip, asking 300 pounds for one lock.
This married father of a child has now installed technology both at home and in his own car, BMW Z4, which will start when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House Exponent went to taxpayers to pay thousands of dollars
According to TIME’s published military documents, the White House’s decision to fly a Navy helicopter last month for the American production event went to the south yard for taxpayers to pay up to $24,000.
The Green and White Color Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One during the President's stay, was the central attraction of the event in the White House on 17 July.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and Senior officials at the White House renewed industrial products from all 50 states during their tour.
Helicopters built in Connecticut were exposed together with yachts from Maine, fire trucks from Wisconsin, and forklifts made in Mississippi.
According to the documentation of the helicopter Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) responsible for operating the helicopter, the White House War Cabin required a partial command of the presence of the helicopter, i.e. FARGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the south yard for an unusual event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this, because this is an unusually high-profile event," said the commander of HMX-1 the day before the event in e-mail to his superior, the deputy Marine Chief Officer in the field of aviation.
The message indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the south yard about 7 a.m. on the morning of 17 July at the beginning of the event and will remain there until the yard was cleaned between 18 and 21 the same evening.
It was added that if leaving the White House were to be present, the return flight would require a second equipasian due to the limitations on working time.
The original flight crew were at the helicopter during the event and the squadron security remained close to the aircraft during its stay on the ground.
It was not possible to determine from the documents given to TIME magazine whether or not another equipasm was finally needed.
The Hatchi Act prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 was investigating whether this event could violate this provision.
"We asked if it was a violation of Hatchi's law, and we were told not to break it," the commander wrote.
"You seem to have no choice," replied the deputy chief officer.
The White House declared the event "made in America" an official event, and Hatch's law wouldn't cover it.
But even at official events, there are political altons.
The President supported the efforts of the health reform at the time of the Senate debate and approved efforts to keep government regulations under control.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The rapporteurs must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them purely as a photo session is unusual.
Trump came to the attention in February when his first campaign event in Florida, Melbourne, was in the background of the president's plane, and his Twitter account comes from messages that complain about how his predecessor used the President's plane.
"The White House is very pleased with the exhibition "made in America", where products were represented from all 50 states manufactured by American workers on American materials," said Lindsay Walters, the White House Press Officer.
HMX-1 teams often conduct experiments around Washington and the south yard to practice the landing at the U.S. President White House with a centimeter accuracy.
When Trump attended the G20 Summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 organised 58 landings in the White House Court.
According to the official, the flight was considered as part of the study flight standard for the "America-made" flight crew that month.
The squadron helicopters flew for another 11 hours on that day for "non-presidental support missions".
According to the White House, none of the other exhibitors of this event burdened the taxpayer's wallet.
According to Sikorsky’s representative, the company was not involved in organising the expedition on the southern courtyard.
HMX-1 does not maintain the president's budget documents and the exact costs of the event are difficult to identify.
However, according to the Ministry of Defence’s annual prices for the financial year 2017, the VH-3D compensation rate is 24 380 dollars per hour.
The Escaar documents indicated the flight length from its basic base to the Navy Quantico Airport in both directions of Virginia for 30 minutes.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is well below that amount.
"The calculation of the cost of paying agents based on estimated compensation rates is very misleading," said Walters.
"These estimated compensation rates shall include staff, maintenance and many other irreversible expenditure, which shall be taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to the 2015 RAND survey, the Ministry of Defence's compensation rates do not include personnel costs, but they do cover fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
The former White House pressman, Sean Spiker, was protecting the use of a helicopter at the time.
"The point is to show things made in America this week," said Spider.
"And I know that the Sikorsky and Connecticut states are very proud to contribute to our national security and that there are hundreds of people expected to exist if not even thousands of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that, just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked hard on.
So, of course, it's right to highlight it."
It's not clear whether Trump was in contact with a helicopter in the south yard during a tour of the event, but he was behind the fire truck.
In the White House, Trump Sikorsky approached representatives, making fun of the media about company products in his personal aircraft park.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of their products."
Grit Shadeiko - through tears came peace and joy
In 2011 in Dagus, Shadeikot was hit in the last area, 800 m ran on foot, and the silicon was removed from the stadium with a carrier frame.
Right before that, he had received zero in the distance jump of the universe held in China.
The 2012 Helsinki EM broke the injury caused by the cheap drop, but at the debutolympics held in London he was ranked 23 with 6013 points.
But bad luck continued.
After the opening day of 2013 Moscow MM received a thumb injury in the distance of the Estonian woman in the Estonian schedule.
Two years later, Beijing’s MM received 15th place, and the Olympic Standard was fulfilled, but it was also a disappointment to the athlete.
The hardest catalyst was passed by Shadeiko only last year unless the result of the long-distance jump of the Amsterdam EM was recorded at first.
I'd just like to put together one fair multi-competition just once.
Once," confessed Shadeiko.
The worse one was ahead: a month later, his Olympics broke down in Rio due to thigh injury.
The time had to be taken off - do you even have to go on with the seven races?
Is two days of effort worth all this?
The girl thought for a long time, but found peace.
I got my head cleaned up.
This experience is relatively difficult to describe, but I've been thinking that last season and Rio Olympia were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal and think clean.
"I knew I wouldn't put the pills in the bag yet," says Shadeiko about her self-cleaning.
I was able to turn the clean sheet and move on with a new rush.
According to Coach Anne Mägi, it was very difficult to look at the suffering under care, but she realized that the athlete himself must first and foremost come to terms with it.
After all, he was so maimed up by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
"Grit said he wouldn't give up and he wants to prove what he's worth," says Mägi.
Now he has some kind of peace.
He'll do it for himself.
The competition came back in May, when Šadeiko set a new Estonian record 6280 points at the Götzis multi-competition.
In the high-level competition, he improved his personal top mark with a bullet force of nearly a metre (13.89) and ran a record-nearing barrier to time.
Then the multi-competitor felt that it was not a talent ceiling, but that it was only a first starved race.
Mägi, who supervised him for years, says that Shadeiko is a master student.
He's an athlete. He's good at training.
If something goes wrong, or if it's wrong, he'll say it right away.
He knows his body and trusts his senses.
That's what we have to do.
I can't tell you exactly what to do and what to do.
A new approach has also been found by Shadeiko.
"I am not the kind of person who makes the most of the workout," he says and says that the most important thing is getting the right feeling, because it also ensures a good result.
Baby’s Happiness Makes You Happy
Good emotions have also been offered to Shadeiko by his loved ones.
Her former training partner, Maris Mägi, and Sister Grete, have recently become parents and has received support from the new weatherers.
"It's been interesting," says Shadeiko.
One alcohol whose drinking is equal to brain training.
Livestrong writes that Dr Gordon Sheperd is such a big fan of wine that he believes that wine can train the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
In his words, it is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather about the "very active" taste of wine.
By smelling glass, spinning wine in the mouth, enjoying it, and perceiving the aftertaste, we put our brains to work to create a taste of wine.
According to Sheperd, wine molecules do not actually contain taste, but the taste comes from the way the wine stimulates the brain.
He's a comparison of how the brain "sees" colors.
"The taste is not in the wine, the taste creates the taste of the wine," Sheperd says.
For example, things that are still affecting the taste of wine are our age, gender, and even the amount of saliva that man produces.
Sheperd, of course, tells me that wine isn't enough to get drunk.
"There's got to be more to it," he says.
If you're taking too big a sip, the system's out of control.
Too much wine drinking can harm the brain instead of taking advantage of it - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine, memory loss, loss of balance and reduced mental capacity are at risk.
10% of the Estonian ICT sector employees receive less wages from colleagues
Data from the personnel search company Fontes reveal that 10% of the employees in the Estonian ICT sector receive less wages from their colleagues.
A ten percent pay gap is between men and women, writes on the portal Genius.
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the salary study of the Fontese ICT sector.
Overall, there were 8 577 posts under observation.
63% of the posts were employed by men.
"Although only 3 companies stated that the pay gap was in favour of men and that the rest of the companies felt that there was no pay difference, in reality, compared to similar works, the men's monthly basic salary was 10% higher than women's and the men's total annual salary was 8% higher than women's," said Fontese analyst Ilmar Nõhjala.
The 3rd season advertising clip of Narcose: Now that Pablo Escobar has gone, the Netflix hit series will take the central position of the Cali cartel
Despite the fact that Pablo Escobar's killer was exposed in the second season of Narcos, the series of Netflix has not ended.
The third and fourth seasons have been confirmed by the streaming service, and the first one has already been made with a advertising clip, which is arousing a series of new evils.
In the third season, the DEA will turn its attention to the richest drug trade organization in the world - the Cali cartel.
They operate under the leadership of the four powerful godfathers, "like Fortune 500 companies", just with more bribes to the government and more violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the head of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) its brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) leads the ties with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In the recently released advertising clip, Pedro Pascali sees Javier Penana returning as a character recruiting American and Colombian law enforcement aid in the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will be open on September 1.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
On Wednesday, the Head of the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan said that elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
The UN Aid Mission Head, Nicholas Haysom, said that hundreds of women are running in local Soviet elections, three women are running as vice-presidents and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The emphasis on the role of women cannot be overstated," he said in his statement on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent the people and be credible only if women are fully involved and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The local Council elections and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban has, for its part, threatened the electoral process, which coincides with the transition period in which international military operations will become advisory.
This year's elections will mark the first time that power will be handed over peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said that women's strong role will increase the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission, 1.2 million women from 3.6 million registered voters have been registered.
The joy of sharing makes everything more acute for both the big and the small.
There is always too little time in common, but the workout with the bushes provides a good opportunity to unite together, play, closeness and load.
And what a convenient solution - wherever you cruised in the summer, you always have the living gloves with you and remind you of your small tone impatiently: "Now let's train too!"
Start with a warm-up - it's very good to have a normal gold game or slip along the beach bar.
So who would like to take the shape of the sand cake washed off the waves during the summer?
It's amazing to use children instead of the pole!
First, it is safe and comfortable, the difficulty gradually increases at the same rate as the trainer's strength.
The advanced ones can also make a hole with quite large children.
A child trains balance, reads repetitions, and feels the pleasure of the possibility of a high jug and important to be.
At the same time, larger children can make their own efforts.
The extent of movement should be determined by touching the earth and stretching up your hands.
Keep your fingers straight, ask the mini-abiliser to hold on tight.
The child can be read for repetitions and feel like a coach.
Plank is very useful, but for the child a hopelessly boring exercise.
But it's easy to make things more fun!
Game Plank: Take a long plank column to get through.
In fact, it's harder than usual, but it's much more fun than you can give your friend a hand in the meantime.
To add a load, you can stay in the plank, on your back, and walk around in that position.
A little bit of difficulty can make a child sit on her hips, but this exercise offers fun for all children.
While crabs are on the sand, triscusses, ashes, and abdominal loads can be found on the sand.
The child descends on his feet so that his body weight is distributed equally in front and back.
It's safe to hold hands.
Swirl your legs and stretch straight up.
The fun can fly, be fun, be balanced, be difficult.
A little coach's life is extra fun when he gets a little kiss every time he comes up.
The extra burden is for stretching the legs forward.
Make sure your back stays neutral.
Children themselves have much more fun to do with a pair and a box.
Handicraft and a pulse cap.
Watch the child's safety, knee position, and keep your back neutral.
All children's favorite and great fun!
For the parent, however, it is truly effective throughout the body exercise.
The sports equipment were Ott (10), Säde (8), Luck (4).
A trip from the Philippines to the heart of a wide world, the Oil Bag.
Bags braided from straw are summer classics, which in recent years have become their own hit product, which a true souvenir has to hang at the end of his hand and which, despite its modest origin, has been known by traders to weld more of the price label appropriate to the hit.
A bag of straws is probably one of those things that has existed once in life and that has not been caused by special emotions.
It just exists, and if it doesn't, there's nothing broken.
Now, however, the shoulder bags are making a real race, and the fashion fans have changed their fine designer bags for summer months against simple sacks.
It is not just a beach bag, but it is also popular as a street bag today, and the braver women even walk into the office.
However, it is worth noting first whether such a summer look for the boss still sits or pays for the wet and the laptop to be pushed to a slightly more formal amount.
However, disparity has made a woman’s summer love of straws.
For example, when you read foreign fashion blogs, the first thing you notice is that on a holiday trip, fashion-gurmans return to the local market as the first thing, and buy themselves some straws, which will then be loyal throughout their rest period, and which will accompany you on the beach, on the market, and also with friends on top of the city.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy more bags from the market and sell or give them to their loyal readers.
In this context, it is worth noting that the demand for bags is so great among the readers that in the real world, women (and men!) will probably go up against each other by hand to become the happy owner of some bags.
In some respects, such madness is also understandable, because few are these times, when in the fashion world it is possible to buy some things that have risen to a slow position for just a few euros.
True, clever traders have also found a simple way to make money here, and so the finer luxury brands also sell straw bags for a few hundred and thousand euros.
Probably to make the richer customers not feel like they're mere mortals who promote around with some cheap bags.
For example, Dolce & Gabbana can buy more than a thousand Euros.
The Chanel Oxide can, however, be translated into EUR 6000.
Unlike most Moehites, the straws do not come from a few great fashions, but their story began from a distance.
It is alleged that straws come from far from the Philippines, where they have been carried out in the wide world.
It's mostly exporii business and local people don't see around with them very often.
It's said that the oil-sinking technique dates back to the 14th century and is pretty tight with the usual basket-punching.
However, since the bag does not need to be braided as hard as the basket, the patterns and other materials can be intertwined in them, making the bag more personal, and thus more attractive.
For example, recently, there are particularly trendy bags in which coloured ribbons or leather strips are folded.
However, the letters of thanks may be sent first and foremost to actress Jane Birkin, of whom the largest of the braided straws had never been seen.
In fact, he fitted the straw with all kinds of sets of clothes and did not even have to go to Cannes Film Festival.
Today, the popularity of bags does not have a smaller role to play, but also the fact that caring for them is a cockhead, and unlike all kinds of Sumadans, they do not have to be cared for by special means, but also by water and wet towels.
As in the case of trend raids, brands have come out of all kinds of interpretations since classical appearances.
For example, if you wish, you can get yourself a ridge or a tiny shoulder bag that is braided from your shoulders.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that the classic shoulder bag never goes out of style, but it does.
But what's a classic shoulder bag?
For centuries, a bag of straws that resembles a basket of its style has been considered classic and has shorts, as well as straws, handles.

GMB is concerned about investment in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The trade union expects manufacturers of cookies in McVitie's to confirm long-term production plans at the company's Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has been silent about the future investment of the Tollcross object.
More than 500 people work at the factory where Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies are produced.
McVitie's owner, Platis, said they've invested more than £5 million in an object over the last few years.
There were more employees and union presidents "are the first to hear" when something changes in the plant's activities.
In a letter sent to the company's object manager, GMB Scotland asked McVitie to "dissolve concerns about the fact that funding is not used to modernise production lines".
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we can't get the head of the object's head in terms of Tollcross's business needs and future investment plan makes our members deeply concerned.
This has worked for generations of families, and the workforce consists largely of the local community and people in the Glasgow neighbourhood, being an essential pillar in ensuring decent employment in an area where there is high unemployment and social exclusion.
Thus, in view of the jobs, wages and well-being of the eastern part of Glasgow, and in the context of the increase in Brexit, living costs and the chronic decline in production, there is a serious need for a company with strong growth in McVitie."
The board representative said: "Tollcross's object manager only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company responds directly to it because we value active communication with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting was held in Tollcross between employees and GMB representatives, where a number of problems were discussed openly.
We then discussed with the workers that, like all other companies in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we will keep our activities under review - and this applies to all our companies and our objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years we have invested over £5 million in the Tollcross object, most of it has gone into production lines and improvements in operations.
We fully understand the legacy of Tollcross as a production object, and if there is any change in the activity of the object, employees and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it."
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about the approach to Neymar?
La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up trying to lure Neymar into his ranks by offering him an offer of £ 189 million. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago about this record of conquest?
This dazzling approach has opened the summer transition window, and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break more than double the current world-wide overstorage record set up last season by Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United for £89 million.
Once the transition is complete, Neymar will be the world's most expensive player and also the most paid professional athlete in the world, who will receive more than GBP 500 000 a week after payment from PSG.
Barcelona is also known to be angry about both the approach and the release of Neymar, although the source close to Catalans' board confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the football player since his arrival in Santos in 2013.
But did the president of PSG warn the football world about such an opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in concluding a contract with Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser strongly warned all clubs who were thinking about recruiting some of the best PSG players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we'll meet them and contact them," said Al-Khelaif.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign a contract with one of our players, they must face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed that line because the Spanish club showed interest in the PSG’s central player Marco Verratt earlier this summer.
The PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italians to leave on any condition and that Barcelona could be set back as a result of this interest, losing one of its precious assets in the form of Neymar.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges after Brexit, not borders.
"Brex is seriously threatened by a struggle between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Great Britain and Ireland", said Varadkar on his first visit to Northern Ireland after his appointment in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made it possible for the current free movement of people and goods, said Varadkar.
"This is our vision for the future: build bridges, not borders," he stressed.
According to Varadkar, he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union and, as it is not possible, to remain part of the European common market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Irish Republic and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make Britain's departure smoother would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, explained the Irish Prime Minister.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "We could certainly have such an agreement with Great Britain".
An alternative to this would be to return to customs points, which would declare historical fragmentation and political failure.
"The barrier to trade, prosperity and peace", said the Irish Prime Minister.
He called Brexit "the challenge of our generation" and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland's everyday life.
The Irish Prime Minister met with the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland to visit Belfast.
Märt Avand, who passed his first half-long triathlon: Ironman can pass through anyone.
Today, the largest triathlon festival in the Baltic States was held in Otepää, the winter capital, when half a thousand triathlets from more than thirty countries took part in the Ironman competition.
The 70,3 km distance consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling and 21,1 km of cycling.
Among others, Märt Avand finished his first triathlon.
"I thought it was going to be difficult and it was finally difficult," said Avandi at the finish.
Despite the complexity, Avand found that the triathlon was actually available to all.
"Not a distance kills, but a pace kills," he said, suggesting that at a given pace, almost everyone gets to the finish.
Except Ott Sepp: "He's fine with physics, but he can't swim."
Avandi had been working hard since February.
At first 4-5 hours a week, but later 10 hours a week.
In time 05:34:12 he reached 270th place in general.
Although Avand lost both Raio Piiroja (time 04:59:53) and Jürgen Ligi (time 05:06:37), he won other so-called "prominent class" competitions.
Last year, Tanel Padar, who was "a good example of a person," lost Avand in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18).
The German John Moldan was crowned as the general winner of Otepää's men in the Ironman series at 3:58:27, the best of the Estonians at 04:14:09.
Among women, the Dane Helle Frederiks triumphed at 04:24:01, while of the Estonians, Maria Rabbit, who lost Frederix in about half an hour and received 04:58:58.
The opening passed a distance of 1.9 km in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water in 410.
