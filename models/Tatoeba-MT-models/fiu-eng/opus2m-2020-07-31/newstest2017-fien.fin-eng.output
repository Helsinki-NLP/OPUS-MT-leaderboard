The 28-year-old chef was found dead at the mall in San Francisco.
The 28-year-old chef who moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairs of the local shopping center this week.
But the victim's brother says that he doesn't know anyone who wanted to hurt him and says, "His business was finally going well."
The body found at the Westfield Mall Shopping Center on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old sanfranciscola Frank Galicia, the San Francisco D.A.'s office.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was found to be a homicide and that an investigation is under way.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the KGO at San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a bus stop in Boston, had been given his dream job as head of the Sanfrancisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant, and six months ago.
The representative of Sons & Daughters said that they were "horrified and shocked" because of his death.
"We have a small team that works like a family, and they're going to miss him very much," said the representative.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank spent the night at the hostel, but that recently "his business was finally going well".
"He found the apartment and dated a girl," Louis Galicia told the KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was kind, and he had a big heart.
His way of feeling cohesion with the family was to make us food, make us dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of dispute.
He was a brother who was driving along with the river.
"In a world where so many things are wrong, he was an unworked diamond that shined brighter every day," he said.
Everyone with information is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's hotline at 415-575-444.
Doctors strike: Requirements for new work-related measures
Doctoral practitioners' representatives have asked their trade union to adopt new labour-related measures in their dispute with regard to the new agreement.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) invites the Council as a whole to support new labour-related measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC says that the ministers have failed to take concerns about the agreement.
In July, doctors and medical students voted to reject a contract agreed with BMA.
58% of the members who voted rejected it.
On Thursday evening, in his letter to the members of the JDC president, Ellen McCourt, said that the government had remained "self-sufficient" on issues which, he said, led to the rejection of the agreement.
He said, "In this light, the JDC Government has voted to reject the proposed new agreement and to demand formal renegotiation of all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Government has today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council with a view to authorising a progressive and expanding work-related programme starting early in September.
The dispute has resulted in the participation of doctors in six strikes this year, including the first complete workout in the history of the NHS health care system.
The director of BMA’s medical practitioners, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned after the vote had rejected the terms of the agreement recommended by BMA.
He had told BMA members that the agreement was good and should be accepted at meetings before the vote of 54 000 doctoral practitioners and students.
After the vote, the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the agreement would be awarded to British doctors.
Russia and Turkey: external association?
Ele, who ended up in a crisis.
On Tuesday, the leaders of Russia and Turkey met to shake hands with each other and declare the eight-month battle of words and financial sanctions officially ended.
However, when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I received the clear impression that there is a greater desire for this reconciliation in Ankara.
Yes, they did.
But Putin’s smile seemed violent, and he didn’t boast much of the heat, even according to his own restrained standards.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan kept talking about his "loved friend" Putin five times according to a report.
I lost count.
He also swore that relations with Russia would not only return to the level before the crisis, but also to a better one.
The next day, the newspapers here described Erdogan's behavior as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his zeal was a reflection of the opposite.
But the violines of Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the reason for the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at that time was violent.
Putin attacked Ankara for stabbed Moscow in the back.
The insult was even worse when it came from an alleged friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of the Russian public has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media led an amazing, thorough attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks seemed to be guilty of everything.
The most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in the Syrian territories of Isis.
He's been emphaticly denying this.
But the official message in St. Petersburg was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia has won some kind of victory.
The benefits of agreeing on a serious weapon are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost expelled from power in the failed coup last month.
The continued terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian financial sanctions have been severe, particularly the ban on charter flights, which generally carry several million Russian tourists on the Turkish coast each year.
The figure has fallen by almost 90 per cent.
With regard to Russia, local tour operators and charter airlines will certainly be relieved when flights eventually continue.
They're hoping for a late-season rush.
And already this week, the state TV has predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables since the re-importation of agricultural products from Turkey.
"Accompanies there, tomatoes back here," as described in the report of the Vedemosti newspaper.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
There is a great deal of anger in the West about what is considered a weak response to an attempted coup.
Adding the long-lasting grudge from advanced EU membership negotiations to this, Putin is eager to exploit coolness and break the ties of Turkey to the West.
The Russian leader was guaranteed to have received loose ends from Ankara, where he called after the revolution attempt to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is a survival for Moscow, who has deep roots in the change of power of his own fear.
So this meeting in the Praméa maritime battles enabled the Russian-Turkish 'outer union' presented by Russia, as one analyst described the situation for me: two countries experiencing the abandonment of the Western countries and the wrong treatment of them, combining their forces.
However, the two have great differences despite the public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently adapted itself to the role of the peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It may be much to say that after almost three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even dealt with the matter.
The Turkish President deliberately avoided answering the question with regard to their differences, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear agreement on where they can look for a common basis for Syria.
After months of open hostilities, and given the possibility of a full disaster by NATO member Turkey while shooting down a Russian combat plane, it is certainly better that two leaders are even in speaking rooms.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from non-Scotland customers
According to the bank's CEO, the RBS brand is reduced to the back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was related to the Bank’s international objectives.
Since the bank almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved, it has given up these objectives.
The Bank’s strategies have at this time used the ‘RBS’ brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds used to sponsor international sports, from Six Nationsrugby to Wimbledon Master Andy Murray.
But now it is considered right to let national brands come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is in use with Scottish customers, but it will not start again from the beginning.
In England and Wales, all RBS references are converted into NatWest, with the exception of the head office and listings.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used by customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller private banking brands that gain more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed on a tour of customers and staff at Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will become the employer of our investor brand and our employees, because we are now becoming a much more brand bank."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global goals, we have local targets.
Each of these brands means something very different in their own communities, and our staff is working with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it does not continue to sponsor Six Nations, and it has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It is now time for us to move towards a brand bank, because, basically (we have been asking questions) it is about how we can focus on making this a better bank for our clients," said the CEO.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we have done focused on the needs of our customers, not our own, I believe you see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettor wins Newmarket with Predilection and wins at 3000
Dettor sprays champagne after he has a total of 3000 wins after double victory
The competitionist Frankie Dettor confirmed his $3,000 British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached the milestone at the second victory of his home career in his competition with John Gosden, coached by Predilection.
A 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve this milestone in competition.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Detori, who previously won at Ghayyar, said, "This is special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here, too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because I started here 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night and 20 000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
The Dettori absorbs the cheers when he lures Predilection out after victory.
Two contestants have reached this milestone in the contests of champion jockey Richard Johnson and a 20-time-old champion Sir Anthony McCoy with record of his breaking career of over 4300 wins.
Lester Piggot, 9-time Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best racers of the current era, and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone, which only a few have reached before him.
He's elegant and strong, but his tactical abstinence separates him from the other weighing rooms.
He's a great ambassador to competitions, his enthusiasm and charisman have been pulling fans into the race for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have rode with 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a jockey for the weekend and the big ones!
Seriously, Frankie has been riding the winners in Great Britain for most of 30 years, which is great to see.
He's a lively person who's a good thing for the British competition, but besides, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettor celebrated the milestone with a drone landing from the saddle.
Flying from endings to drone landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of the British racing race for two decades.
This has been a mountain bike.
In 1996, he survived an airplane accident and suffered from a ban on the use of drugs, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' victory.
Three years ago, he was having difficulty returning after the six - month ban, but he showed considerable strength in challenging suspects and returning to his best condition.
And he may continue for a long time, but Dettor has said earlier that he would like to continue to compete for at least 50 years.
Russian Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has suddenly fired Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
The Kreml Opinion said that Putin 'has ordered Ivanov to move away from the duties of the Presidential Director of Russia', but there was no reason for it.
Since 2012, Anton Vaino, Deputy Director of Ivanov, has been appointed as his successor.
Parano, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in the capital of Estonia in Tallinn in 2012, graduated from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy of Tokyo.
Later, he led the President's protocol and government staff, says the Kremlin's website (Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important task of administration is to support your activities as Head of State as regards the drafting of laws and the management of the implementation of your guidelines.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave the place and recommended that Vaino be appointed to his place.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like Putin, served as a Soviet security service in the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on state TV, both men claimed that the chief of staff withdrew from his own request.
But despite smiling at the cameras, only a few here are convinced - especially now, just before the elections.
So it's just some sort of power struggle after all?
No one knows yet.
But the official argument that a man who was once advertised as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead Russian environmental policy has been accepted with real suspicion.
In his comments to Putin on the Kreml website, Ivanov said, "it is true that early in 2012 I asked you to give me this very complex task for four years, I wish I could say to the job.
Well, now I've been chief of staff for four years and eight months."
Ivanov approved the mission in December 2011.
He used to be Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service at the KGB, as well as Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the State Security Service at FSB, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed Deputy Director of the KGB.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after the second period of Put, since Put's third period would have been against the Constitution.
However, this assignment went to another close ally in Putin, Dmitri Medvedeville.
Before his return, Putin became president only three and a half years later.
The Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson got fired after he hit the producer.
In the last month, Gibson was involved in a physical dispute at the scene of the series in Los Angeles.
A number of producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his resignation in the joint opinion.
A special agent, Aaron Hotchner, presented an apology on Thursday before his resignation was announced.
There were creative differences and disputes at the scene.
I regret that it happened," he said in his opinion.
According to the statement by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how Gibson's character is removed from the FBI's team are expected later.
Previously, 54-year-olds who stared the Dharma & Greg situation comedy have been in the series since its first season in 2005.
"I love the Criminal Minds series, and I have given it everything I can for the last 12 years," Gibson said in the opinion published on Friday.
I had hoped I'd been with you to the end, but that's not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our incredible working group and, above all, the best fans that the series can have.
The beginning of the twelveth production season of the series is planned for 28 September.
The mystery fish ended up in the garden in Banff.
A man in Banff has asked for help to identify the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be the windfish left behind by the waterroller.
Bain, who lives 500 feet [500 m] from the sea, published film material in Periscope, hoping that someone would bring clarity into the appearance of two - inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now extends to Fifeen
GBP 1,35 billion project is expected to be ready by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern deck of Queensferry's crossing point and the main bridge, which means that the bridge now extends to Fife.
It's the first of the four feathers between the "Cathedrals" that are now about to be completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It's got 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 pence ropes.
The 1.35 billion pound project is now expected to be ready by May 2017.
Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown visited the workplace today and was among the first to walk from country to bridge.
He said, "This is an historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry's crossing.
We are all witnessing truly impressive engineering work in this project, where more than 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel alone are used to build this section of the bridge."
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the bridge between the bridge and the bridge is a demanding operation in which the extremely precise dimensions must be compatible.
All in all, nearly 79% of the bridge is now in place and the last part of the deck is lying in Rosyth today, which means that the entire deck is ready to be raised to its seats on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Head of Fort Crossing Bridge Constructions, said: "The first lock in any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this lock represents the top of construction technology.
After the last part of the road cover had been installed and combined with the expanding northern pillar of the road cover, we had to close the remaining part of the road to the north, i.e. the inland part.
This was done by drawing 700 mm south of the northern side of the road.
This was a huge and, at the same time, a very demanding measure.
It's huge, because it's 222 metres long, weighs about 6000 tons and has to be drawn at an angle of approximately 3%.
Necessary, because the allowed deviations, according to which the team worked, were small, only a few millimeters in each direction.
I'm glad everything went well, though.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men are "lucky when they're alive"
Three men are "lucky when they're alive" since they fell off their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station alarmed at 13.20 (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event developing in the Gulf of Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety as their boat went on to its own.
"We saw the boat running closer to the men and imagined the worst," said Vince Jones, Moelfre's lifeboat.
"Happyly, the strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got there," he added.
A local fishing boat saved two men, and a third, 60-year-old man was found to be exhausted hanging out of a boy without life jackets.
The men were taken to the coastal rescue boat and brought back to the rescue boat station.
Jones said, "These three men in the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat had a hit-and-run line on its engine, but somehow it had broken the boat off the person when the boat fell.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respected hunt for health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many people have been concerned that teenagers and children are no longer going out to play but prefer to spend their leisure time watching the evidence.
Pokémon Go makes people rise off the couch and participate in some activities.
Display time was initially limited to television, then to video games and now to smartphones recently.
So it is wonderful to see that technology and outdoor activity are not mutually exclusive.
I am, of course, referring to the wildness called Pokémon Go. The app is based on the characters that were originally developed into video games in the 1990s (later they became a series of drawings, playing cards and other follow-up products).
As with many pop-culture phenomena, its popularity was somewhat diluted before this new game was published in the United States, Australia and New Zealand early in July.
Then the release of the game in other countries was postponed, as huge popularity overloaded servers.
Only in days did Pokémon Gola have more users than Tinder and almost as much as on Twitter.
So how does it work?
As explained in a nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémons that are traced via GPS and which can be "phot" after finding (using a phone screenshot) or "steal".
The generation that played the game younger than the one that joined the wild and jumped up from the couch into the search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant addition of the "central" in the daily steps.
The Apple Watch app, which follows 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of the release of the game, the number of people moving within 30 minutes per day jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent of the users following the Cardiogram.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Gota, it only sees the level of training.
Many public health campaigns' calls for "to find 30", "get on the couch" and "be active every day" have not produced any results because most of the public health warnings are boring and cared for by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be ignored.
There is a lower risk of cancer or depression in people who are normally moving.
Activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure and diabetes, and its benefits are too diverse for you to read here.
Pokémon Go's fineness is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This will cover three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air, sunshine, and fun.
Some people even get new friends when they hunt.
As usual, evil evangelists are looking for things to complain about.
Yes, there's someone who can walk towards the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Although there were previously Fitbit-like applications that could monitor activity, they did not give any reason to move in the same way as this game.
The novelty will be lost and its use will cease in time.
However, due to the success of Pokémon, there will be other games that combine applications and virtual reality with the activity of the real world, helping many hunters to be more active, better and healthier.

Simone Biles caught gold in a women's gymnastics multi-game
Forget the pressure.
Forget the publicity board.
Simone Biles is immune to all that.
It's an energy jump.
Swim on a boom.
I can't believe it.
It's great everywhere.
And now, in the end, the Olympics winner.
The 19-year-old American gymnast achieved a multi-stakeholder championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between himself and the rest of the world to the Olympics.
His total score, 62.198, was clearly better than Aly Raisman and Russian Bronzemitist Aliya Mustafina.
On Thursday, 2016 at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in the finals of the multi-stakeholder of women in the US Simone Biles on balance.
The party became the fourth American woman who has won the championship of the multi-stakeholder in a row and, overall, the fifth American champion, and at the same time he strengthened his reputation for his generation, and perhaps for the best of all time.
He burst into tears when his final point was announced, and his long journey toward this moment ended.
This achievement brings him to the same class as the other best athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their species to a new level:
Bales has been ruling his race for the last three years, winning the 15 World Championships, including 10 gold, with programmes whose ambition and precision mix have been so amazing that the 1984 Olympic Champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best gymnast to see".
The last test waited in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Bales and other competitors, but between him and the burden of excessive expectations.
Returning home to Texas Spring without a handful of gold medals would have been disappointing.
The United States Simone Bales, on the left, and Aly Raisman, after winning the gold and silver medal (in this order) in the finals of the multigambling of women's multigambling individuals in the summer Olympics of 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday, live.
Bales reached the first medal on Tuesday, when he was at the departure party of the national team coordinator, Martha Karoly, who lived as a climax.
Although Bales claimed that he had never thought about the future in his long journey to the top of the road, it was not entirely truthful.
Part of his permanto program, which includes his trademark, is adapted to Latin American music, which would be great on the street next to the Rio Olympics.
It's not a coincidence.
This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a dead man, was found by Coach Aimee Boorman's mother when she was on a field trip to the gym where Boorman was trained, has become a force.
He has not lost in a multi-game since summer 2013, and this winning line will continue for as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina was in a small chair after two rounds, it was just a illusion.
The balance bar and the permanto, where Bales was a world champion, waited.
He rose to the top at boom points 15.433 and exceeded them by getting 15.933 permanance.
Raisman hugged him with good will when they waited for the final points - only formalities - and tears rose into the eyes of Bales with glitter red, white and blue bounds, when the dream of which he once wrote his book became true.
Raisman's performance was some kind of revantage from four years ago when he was divided in third place, but lost the bronze to Mustafila in the repetition.
This time, a 22-year-old team leader called "the Grandmother" was clearly in charge.
After her permanent performance, she sent flight kisses to the audience a return that, at times, seemed questionable.
As far as Biles is concerned, this 19-year-old wide-ranging twitter from this previous week will have a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims of serial murder were shot while they were listening to music in the car
In the most deadly attack of Phoenix's first serial killer in the last decade, two women died, and a 12-year-old girl sat in the car talking and listening to music when they were shot, which was reported in the police press release on Thursday.
The authorities said that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, were shot in a car parked on the road on 12 June.
The press reports that the shooter standing on the passenger's side of the car fired up to eight times and then fled with another vehicle.
According to the police, the triple death didn't appear to be the result of the robbery, because the attacker didn't take any purses or another adult victim had $29,900.
Phoenix Police Officer, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that the shooting caused the investigators to see if it was connected to four previous attacks.
All seven people have died and two have been wounded in nine attacks during four months, mainly in Latin America.
"These happen in the residential area in front of the home," Howard said earlier this month to CBS' subsidiary KPHO.
The suspect is believed to have been using several vehicles, such as the brown Nissan in the late 1990s, the black BMW in the late 1990s and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Scientists have not agreed to reveal evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks are related and are committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized because of his injuries, where he died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
The witness told the police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which took place only half an hour before the triple death, with the target of an empty open van, which is also believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
The scientists found shell shell shells, bullet seat, and bullet fragments in the engine room.
A 6-year-old mother with microkephalia: "Your business gets easier"
Edmund Picciuto, like most of the other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund is a small-headed man, and this is the result of a genetic disorder his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know when she was pregnant.
"When he came home for the first time, my first thought was that I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't promise anything like this.
Which is not true at all - of course I promised," he said.
He and his husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund would never necessarily learn to recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was, "I didn't know people were still doing it," Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with his walking tent.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl like he was just three years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he slowly reaches some milestones.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth will show you how to spell "sing to me" with the uninformed word made up by Edmund.
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not the usual sign language, he tells me that Edmund has invented some of his own pennies.
Microcephalitis can be caused by a wide variety of causes: genetics, such as Edmund, or during pregnancy, such as Cinderella or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it affects the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional load caused by an uncertain future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
He still doesn't know.
Actually, I haven't asked for a prognosis in a while, because I don't expect anyone to actually give me one.
But Picciuto has hopeful counsel for mothers whose babies have birth defects due to Zika.
It'll make things easier.
You can believe it's gonna make things better.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
The rains and floods caused rescue operations in Mississippi Louisiana
In Louisiana, heavy rain and widespread floods caused the governor to declare the emergency on Friday, and more rain was expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reports that numerous rivers in south-eastern Louisiana, as well as the southern Mississippi, flooded their hares and caused a major flood due to extreme rainfall.
The governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, said that the state authorities are constantly in contact with local authorities and that help is already coming to the districts that need it.
Mike Steele, from the Governor's office for security and emergency services, said that they will receive requests for upland vehicles, boats and sandfalls.
Steele said that the only county of Tangifork asked for tens of thousands of sand bags.
The flood guard is valid until Saturday in a large part of southern Louisiana.
In the opinion, the weather service said that a further three to five cents of rain would be expected.
In southern Alabama, the flooding rate was valid on Friday as the rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River, which flows near Baton Rouge, and the Amite River, which flows near Denham Springs, are both located in Louisiana, and they were predicted to set a flood record during the weekend.
weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood into several houses in suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the flooding of the Ascension district along the river would be a threat when the flooding rivers slowly fell to Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, which flows south of the state of Mississippi in Liverpool, was on the highest level of all time on Friday morning at 9 a.m.
Saviours are still picking people out of flood water in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and half-witches were near Gloster on Friday.
62-year-old Hansford says that normally over 400 feet away from his house, the water of Beaver Creek rose rapidly during the night.
He says that the other stepne, who lives nearby, warned him.
"We woke up, and the water just continued to rise," Hansford said.
It reached all the way to my waist.
Hansford’s wife told her husband that she has not seen a stream of water so high in the 48 years she has lived there.
Hansford said that he and his family had injuries and that he was the only swimmer.
Hansford said that the rescue workers saved the three in a large army-style truck and took them to the Gloster Fire Station, where the rescuers stayed on Friday.
According to Krautmann, floods are rapidly spreading as heavy rains continue, and the authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says that a Witness near Livingston reported 13.7 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the country had been completely bored of the heavy rain that continued since Wednesday.
The rainfall and the flooding of the streets led to the rescue of the residents of the Tangi Devil County from their homes and the withdrawal of lessons in five school districts, the authorities reported.
A CBS subsidiary, WWL, reported that a member of the City Council in Tangihea said that 200 homes were flooded.
The inhabitants were evacuated to two churches, but they are now under flood.
The district president, Robby Miller, said that the authorities saved 72 people and 7 pets who had remained in the islands of the tide.
The cities of Amite and Hammond have opened shelters for those who have been evacuated.
"They will return to their homes when the water starts to fall," he said.
In the town of Hammond in the region of Tangi evil, twenty streets were shut down because of rising water, and the residents were allowed to pick up sand bags to try to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
"The last major flood was here in March," said Lacy Landrum, the city's administration.
This is becoming a similar case.
In Mississip, Harrison County's emergency chief Rupert Lacy said that the steady rain continued on the Gulf coast.
He said that on Thursday a handful of houses were reported to have been flooded, but no floods have been reported so far on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods, has lived in the region for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and the rain continues."
The six-year-old Mahah Brown who was "During bullets" will survive the shooting of Philadelphia.
The police say that a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which means another six-year-old in town this week.
The kid's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name was Mahahda Brown.
Grandparents say that Brown had multiple gunshot wounds, including his legs, hands, and stomach, but he was conscious when he was moved to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets," the boy's grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the boy’s condition has been recorded as critical, and he has had several surgeries.
The family tells the station he's expected to recover.
The boy was about to start his first grade at the local secondary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown quarter.
Also three men were shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-olds.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car together with a 29-year-old in critical condition, station reports.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police are looking into whether one of the injured men could be a shooter.
The investigators are telling CBS Philadelphia that it seems that there was a cross between several shooters.
The attack-type shells, derived from various weapons of attack, filled the scene.
It seems that this was definitely a constant battle.
There were shells on the street on both sides of the sidewalk.
"It seems that there were several armed fighters here and that they were in an active battle," Anthony Ginaldi, the Chief of Police of Philadelphia, told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made, and the police are investigating surveillance footage.
Another six - year - old, girl, hit her hand with delusions on Tuesday when she was playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That is why I call this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
Firstly, I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team includes three gymnasts, Simone Bales, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of this team, supplemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocia, is proud of everyone.
This team looks like, finally, America.
It has also established the presence of dark - skind and Latin - American women at the top of the species.
For the last four years, the most successful female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were first and second.
This is great.
At the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas surprised me as an Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world has proved the incredible performances of the three-time world champion Simone Bales, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, in which they present unexpected but masterly gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman who has been incessantly winning the unique gold in women’s multigambling.
And teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the top of the species, but the situation doesn't look like this in the gyms around the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all walked the same path as Aly and Madison reached the Olympic Team.
They are "Final Five" (the last five) because there will be only four gymnasts in the next Olympics, and this will be Marta Karoly's last year as coach.
The reality is, however, that gymnastics is a expensive species, and gymnastics train mainly in private gymnastics clubs, which are maintained by parents who pay training, facilities, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for trainers and their gymnastics and families) and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in prosperous suburbs that can support the species.
In these clubs, gymnasts get all their training, and this is a expensive and long-term commitment to the gymnastics families.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Bales coach, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We should bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to communities where there are numerous young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I set up my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organisation, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15 000 urban youths (mainly black and Latin) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (My hometown) to provide a high level of gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this significant Olympic species.
The gymnasts develop body strength, flexibility and coordination, as well as mental diligence, discipline, and determination.
This combination offers life-long benefits for good health, school and work success.
This team's inspiration makes thousands of young girls start gymnastics, and it's awesome.
Participation in sport is so important, especially for girls.
We're living in an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for demonstrating a serious "girl power" by winning the Olympic team, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road towards a healthy, strong and successful young womanhood.
Doctors organising new strikes after leaving Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with the British Medical Association staff, but 58% of the doctor's trainee who took part in the 37 000 vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the agreement, saying that NHS was on "the unknown soil", and that even minor additional delays harm staff and patients.
The first doctors will be transferred to a new contract containing changes in night and weekend working habits to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Last night, Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Medical Trainer Committee, said in the opinion: "Doctor trainees still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, in particular to accelerate the current labour crisis and not to treat all doctors fairly."
Before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new agreement, only eight weeks remain, progress must be made and the time is running out.
Through the negotiations, BMA's attempts to resolve the dispute have faced the government's lack of involvement and sometimes deep silence.
In spite of Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, remove the sanctions and take into account the concerns of doctors.
If he doesn't, doctors will be ready to continue the fight at work.
The latest strike at the end of April meant a delay of nearly 13,000 routine surgery and 100,000 reception times when nurses and consultants were recruited to serve as replacement doctors in the strike guard.
Ministers had hoped to put an end to the changes to the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with the staff of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants better weekend pay with 54 000 trainees under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, appealed to doctors not to strike.
Mortimer said: "The fights achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already in a demanding situation, and cause anxiety, anxiety and disruptions to patients, carers and their families."
Over the last two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of control (Gardian Role) and presentations (Whistleblowing).
Employers were hopeful that a continuous positive debate on other important topics - such as development, flexibility in education, further training for those returning from Sabbath leave, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay differences in medicine - would be a sign of the seriousness of the agreements reached with employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health in November, February and May with BMA.
Two pounds per day may reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from two pounds a day after the authorities recommended that they be given longer to humans.
A medicine used to prevent blood clots, ticagrelor, reduces the risk of renewable seizures in people with heart disease.
The medicine is given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or another seizure.
NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NICE, the supervisor of NHS, has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Some 140 000 people get a heart attack every year in England, and one - quarter of them get another seizure or stroke.
The heart attacks and strokes are due to the building up of the artery wall fat that forms a lotion.
If a narrowing breaks, it can cause a blood clot that prevents blood circulation to the heart causing a heart attack.
If the clot goes off, it can go with the blood and cut the bloodstream into the brain causing a stroke.
People who have already had one seizure have an increased risk of getting another one.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by AstraZeneca, a company in Great Britain, and sold under the name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clotting less likely.
The draft NICE guidance published today recommends that humans receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin taken twice daily for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, head of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "In spite of the availability of effective anti-progressive treatments, even a quarter of people who have had a heart attack will later have another heart attack or stroke, the consequences of which are often devastating."
Fear of renewal can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
When initially recommending ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to increase the available treatment options for thousands of people who may benefit from them.
As data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly as regards the risk of bleeding - are limited over periods of more than three years, the draft guidance does not recommend longer treatment than this period.
A culture of political correctness allows for the flourishing of electoral power in Muslim regions
The former Mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed last year for corruption, giving impetus to the government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to widespread fraud of vote in Muslim communities being ignored, revealed today in a shocking government report.
Former Minister of Government Sir Eric Pickles sets up police, electoral supervisors and city councils for ignoring the evidence of election fraud because of "the hypersensitivity of race and religion".
The former Secretary of the Community, the current Emperor of anti-corruption, said that it is so serious that the intimidation of voters on religious grounds should be allowed to place guard chains outside the polling stations in order to protect scared voters.
He recommends that voters present an identity card when voting to prove who they are.
Today, voters only have to say their name and address.
The report even proposes that an inexhaustible ink be put in the finger of the voting person so that no one can vote twice.
We should better protect the public, Sir Eric says.
He calls on the press to have access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or by a working group.
"This would not only protect us from electoral fraud, but would protect local government from a culture of greater corruption and economic fraud, which goes hand in hand with electoral fraud," he said.
The government ordered the report as a result of the vote scandal at the Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court decided that the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed as a result of numerous charges of corruption and illegality.
The Court stated that Rahman's "sacredly distorted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community, as well as silenced his critic's accusations of racism and Islamic fear.
Rahman is said to have led his election campaign on the grounds that it was the religious obligation of loyal Muslims to vote for him.
Even 300 votes were dubious or the result of a person voting in a different way.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed his particular concern at the vote in the electoral process, where members of the high-ranking Muslim community said that they had pressured people to vote on the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made several recommendations on the cleaning of the voting system, including the proof of identity by means of an identity card
He said: "The evidence was presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote at the will of the elders, especially in those communities with a Pakistani orbrian background.
"There were concerns that... state institutions had ignored such conduct because of the 'politically correct' race and hypersensitivity to religion."
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean up the system, including banning political activists from handling voting tickets received by post so that the 'vote of votes' would end.
The report that Mrs Theresa May is looking at also calls for more stringent amendments to be made to the registrations in order to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Review options to prove the identity of voters before voting.
Use the finger of the person voting for the undefeated ink so that no one can vote twice.
Apply systematic national checks to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
Set a limit of three years for requests for automatic post voting.
Prevent political activists from handling the ready-to-read voice and envelopes in which the voices are sent.
Let the police put security chains around the polls.
Change the law so that it will be easier to blame people for intimidation on the basis of the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography illegal at polls.
Require that only English is used in polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that the staff adheres to the rule that voters must go to the head alone.
Sir Eric is holding the police force of Great London, saying it's "surprising" that no criminal charges have been filed since the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court remained behind the numerous acts of corruption and illegality of Lutfur Rahman and his officials," he said.
He was found guilty without doubt on the basis of a number of grounds, according to the criminal evidence threshold.
He also criticises inefficient "grape checks" in the polling offices of the city councils.
Sir Eric said, "The last year's Tower Hamlets judgment was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a glorious legacy as a bearer of parliaments, but this worrying and mysterious spread of electoral power and the banning of certain groups of facts threatens this good reputation."
Crazy to Kate's biking doubles and other photos of celebrities at the Olympics in Rio
This week's fans at the Rio Olympics 2016 Olympics have been confused by the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be an impressive double being by the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympics are certainly not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can boast on his own famous double being - at least according to social media.
So in honor of Rio and all the famous faces on our screens, FEMAIL has drawn up a list of Olympic athletes that look like Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellison, member of the U.S. Fleet Team, on the left, has been compared with Leonardo DiCaprio ever since he was a child
In addition to Kate’s double-flying image on the bicycle track, many people online have been quick to point out how a particular bower could be the star of Leonardo DiCaprio’s twin.
Brady Ellison, member of the U.S. Men's Fleet Team, has caused a storm on Twitter since his photos surfaced, in which he seems to be intimidatingly the same as the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And, in fact, when he became aware of the passion of the social media, the archer admitted that since he was a child, he had heard that he looked like Leo.
"I don't see any great similarities, except for the beard," Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will certainly also be raised this year: the alarming similarity between Britain's long jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The largest Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina, with obvious eyes, has been said to be the double being of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burghi has been comparing a Glee star to Matthew Morrison for years.
Bigger switch to the eye: This user thinks Nathan is an Inception actor's "sporting version"
Another long-term comparison has been between a tennis star named Rafael Nadal and an actor named Josh Hartnett, with similar strong angles and lips.
The Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has the same actor as Annalynne McCord's tanned skin and pale hair, while the United States team Nathan Adrian reminds the fans of the sports version of Joseph Gordon Levit.
Hard women: Football Star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter, right, divide the same face shape and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Presentation of the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason between a pair of similarities
A Twitter user recently expressed his happiness on the site that "other Internet users think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the football star in the United States and Dexter's actress really have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and his smile, which is almost identical to Laura Linney's smile, as well as the gold medal winner Gabby Douglas, a gymnast whose own, beautiful wide smile matches the Bring It On star Gabrielle Union's smile.
The Olympic Commander at CBC will apologize for the Chinese swimmer's "death like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth position on women's 4x200-metre free-circuit message made CBC's direct Olympic viewers raged on Wednesday.
The Canadian television company CBC has had to apologize after one of its reporters said during the race a 14-year-old Chinese female swimmer "lost like a bad smell" and "death like a pig".
Analyst Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to share some of his views in the women's 4x200-metre free-dive communication final.
MacDonald, who came to CBC's reporting team to bring the "color", was heard saying, "That little 14-year-old from China, baby.
Too eager, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swimming at the second part of 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada’s Taylor Ruck, which gave Canada the opportunity to catch China.
The viewers around Canada react quickly online after being shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane, saying, "Did the CBC reporter just say that China's 14-year-old swimmer 'was dead like a pig?"?
The idiot didn't realize he was still live."
Chinese Ai Yanhani was described as a women's free swim in a 4 x 200-metre communication final: "That little 14-year-old from China, baby."
The review of Byron MacDonald on Twitter was tough and quick, with many challenging him.
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how indifferent Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a bunch of racists.
Soon thereafter, Scott Russell, who was running the CBC shipment, apologized to MacDonald’s comments on live broadcasting, saying, “We regret that the comment about swimming was sent.
It was a unfortunate choice of words; we regret that this happened."
The CBC concluded to apologize more than 90 times to people who had twitted in response to the comment.
Mr. Scott Russelin, the reporter, had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC then copied and attached an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald’s comments.
The company also quickly apologized and published the opinion.
We deeply regret the fact that these statements were made and sent live.
Last night we quickly took action and, in a direct broadcast, we apologized to our viewers as well as to our followers in social media.
For the sake of clarity, it has to be said that Byron’s comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.
But this was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in a direct broadcast and tried to define his comment by stating that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize at this moment for the comment that I made last night after the message from the women," he said at the CBC Olympic Mission.
"I was referring to the swimmer's performance, not to him as a person."
"It's unnecessary to say that I didn't mean it to be disrespectful, and that I'm really sorry."
Primark's client was stunned by a woman who arrogantly matched her underwear in the middle of the store.
Customers didn't know where to look when she took off in the middle of Primark's store to try underwear.
The fact that, after assessing what she looked like in her pants, she peeled them off her head and put them back on the shelf.
He continued his tour and finally matched four pair of underpants at the shop in Bouverie Place, Folkeston.
Primark's store at Bouverie Place's mall in Folkeston, where she matched her underwear and then put them back on the shelf.
At the same time, the mother of two children in the store, Jenny Davidson, said that after experimenting with underwear, the mysterious woman "dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything".
He said, "People didn't believe their eyes."
The woman stood in the middle of the store floor, took a couple of panties, undressed her own tights and underwear, and put on suitable legs.
"He didn't even try to find a secluded place to settle, he just stood there shameless."
"They were all staring when he took off his underwear and obviously didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf."
He did the same for three more couples before he finally decided not to like what he saw, to put on his clothes again and to walk out.
"He didn't seem to care who was watching or thought of someone who would end up buying the underwear he made up."
33-year-old Davidson, who lives in Kent City, said, "It's disgusting to think someone's taking home the underwear that someone else has tried, but they haven't been cleaned."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I told you that the staff apparently tried to remove the pieces of clothing from the sale after she left, which is fine."
"It would be terrible to go home with new underwear and find that another woman has put them on and taken them off, and they have not been washed."
The representative of Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place at Folkestone on Tuesday 9 August.
All the products in question have been removed from the market."
This way you can defend yourself against armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to the New York-based Krav Mag Federation Grand Master Rhon Mizrach in order to find out how to deal with gun-spining looters at close range.
From the front or behind, this video will show you how to pay the attacker the same amount.
According to Mizrach, if you're approached from behind, the first thing you need to do is turn around so you can see your attacker and "scramble the line of fire."
Then you grab the gun between the elbow and the shoulder before you hit the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Continue by hitting on the knee, and when the attacker goes from pain to pain, twist the weapon from his hands, hit him at the back of the gun in the face, and retreating, keeping the weapon directed at him.
If an armed person approaches the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the gun and turn it around so that the offender can't fire.
At the same time, put the weight on the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, then pull the gun out of his grip, back off and point the gun at him.
Does that sound difficult?
Watch the video, see exactly how Mizrachi does this.
But remember, if you're not the Grand Master of Krav Maga, the safest way out of the robbery situation is to give up your money.
Tourist Ian Wright licks Europe's dirtiest places for a tour guide
The British tourist has placed a serious challenge on his immune system and on his vomiting reflex by licking some of Europe's dirtyest and most nightly places.
The host and traveler from Suffolk, Ian Wright, 51, licked the euro banknote, the barge in Piccadilly Circle, the washing license of the train's toilet and the Russian public telephone to prove the strength of its immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was going to be in.
The experiment, which was made with a film called Internal Power, produced surprising results.
The idea of licking the spraying label of thousands of people’s trains may seem completely hostile, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Wright continued to speak to doctors and medical professionals about the reinforcement of intestinal bacteria and his or her own health.
Fortunately, nothing that he licked left him in the mouth of a bad taste.
Wright became known as a tester of the endurance of his intestines as he traveled around the world and ate strange and wonderful things.
This task from the public rail stations to the toilet seat’s spraying license did indeed test his immune system.
In a film he said, "I've been quite careless about my health since I was a kid, and I've put all kinds of things in my mouth since I was a little bit old."
He certainly confirmed his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was the dirty Russian public toilet.
There were over 4,000 units on the photometer.
Due to comparison, the reading of the anti-spamed hands should be less than 60.
But in a public toilet in Russia, he refused to lick when the result of the photometer showed more than 4,000 units, and the result of the hands of the opponents is less than 60.
Wright has produced a tourist film, an inner power trail, along with a Finnish makeer, Valio. The film shows the amount of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the movie, the wedding said, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because there's something to eat here.
Following the inner strength was produced together with the Finnish dairyer, Valio.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus containing lactic acid bacteria, vitamin C and D, which help to enhance human intestinal bacteria and immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, head of the selection of snacks, juice and new categories, said: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to watch and at the same time explain the interests of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air, and we came up with the idea of "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of simply talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: to tell about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and its connection to the immune system.
The growing interest in the health of the intestine is a global phenomenon, and this documentary allows us to give more information to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think the document shows that we have a wonderful sense of humor!
The documentary director Tom Hakala added: "Let's say it now: if Ian had licked some of the things I asked him for, like the night-cold Russian toilet shown in the film, I would have lost my respect for him."
Obviously, some of the licking things were easier for Ian, while some were rather difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty arrows recorded."
In a questionnaire carried out in 2015, 84% of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria specifically to the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58% said that at least sometimes they use products with added lactic acid bacteria.
The family destroyed the rental house in Cornwall Saltash, before the eviction.
The Öhköri family caused the damage to their rental house 50,000 pounds after they were expelled for the terrorism of their neighbors.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of the property in Cornwall Saltash since several complaints were made.
After they had been removed from the property by force, the workers of the upset housing company found that the property was in poor condition.
The walls had been made with amputating holes, the floor boards had been torn, the waste had been spread to the floor and the walls had been crammed with graffiti.
The family has now moved and is believed to live in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, the manager of Cornwall Houston, said she was afraid that the property could not be repaired.
He said: "This has been a real nightmare for the inhabitants, and I do not think people should have to live like this.
There is much to be considered here because this property is likely to be known through less comfortable groups of Cornwall.
This family is unreputable, and their names are unreputable."
The couple had three boys who sometimes lived in a real estate, and according to the police, the family's terrible powers had a street fight with baseball bats, the intimidation of nearby residents, the use of drugs, the sale of drugs, and excessive screaming, quarreling and cursing.
In June, 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was in the lease agreement, received a decision on social behaviour.
Many of the rooms in the house under the threat of decommission found old waste.
The property from which drugs were used to be transmitted had been pulled up the floor boards.
The neighbors said that the family was seen fighting on the street, and that the police were regularly called.
Cornwall Houston took away with force a woman and her partner's property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks, time to change voluntarily.
The eased neighbors thanked the exorcism, saying that their lives had become a hell of a thing.
Someone said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived in their neighbors for 20 years, and things have always been bad.
We've seen the police here incredibly many times.
"This morning, we couldn't sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet here, we're not used to it!
I love it now that they're finally gone."
Adam Fitzpatrick, Executive Director of Cornwall Houston, said that the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often invited to the property.
The garbage and old toys have been thrown down on the wildly wall of the rental house.
He added: "It is a pity that the resident did not take any responsibility for his or her own conduct, for eviction is always the last course of action considered by Cornwall Houston.
This was a very difficult case, for behavior was extreme, and their actions must have terrified neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, by Devon and the Cornwall police, and by the brave, informed members of the community.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to the neighbours and send out a message that antisocial behaviour will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys all lived in real estate at different times, but they were all twenty.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one bedroom after the wedding
The employees of the housing company now have to clean up the wastes around the house
In 2014, the police made the raid into the property and found more than 70 g of cannabis and balances, supplies and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Mr Skeldon was fined for holding a class B drug with the intention to pass it on.
He claimed that the money was meant for the tombstone of his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her partners live homeless after being frozen in private accommodation in Plymouth.
For many of the walls of the house rooms, graffitis had been bled out.
The police say they're trying to get rid of the residents who mock the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall Police said that the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who would continue to mock the rules.
"This is a message for those who think that their conduct is without consequences, and for those who suffer from such conduct," he said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behaviour, and the police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
The tourists in Portugal were terrified when the military jet flew down the beach.
Sun worshipers in the Portuguese Aveiro experienced the shock of their lives
The Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion plane wiped by really low
The Air Force said that it was an exercise flight and claimed that safety was not compromised
Right now, horrified tourists began to panic when a low - flying jet wiped over a full beach.
The dramatic recording shows how the military aircraft became almost full of touch from the sun’s worshipers on a sandy strip in Aveiro, Northern Portugal.
The vacationers stood up as they began to understandably worry about the noise from the jet, even though they did not see at first what was coming from behind the clouds toward them.
The incident took place yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
One of the many vacationers who published videos of a dramatic pass in social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said, "It passed twice at a really low point, and it seemed that it was falling on the ground."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing, and it really felt like the plane was falling on me."
The tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared out of darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight designed to identify fishing boats near the coast and had to land so low that it was the only way to check the boats.
He said that the jet had flown significantly lower than usual due to the poor visibility of the smoke caused by nearby SUVs, but the Air Force assured that no one was in danger.
This summer, the fires of the landscape have destroyed parts of the mainland of Portugal, and four people have died on the island of Madeira.
Today, the Portuguese Air Force said that the pilot had to fly in low visibility due to adverse conditions, to smoke from the terrains and the thick fog,
The aircraft was on a training flight, and as part of the training, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats.
The result of the first half of the year is better than expected.
The South Karelian Social and Health District (Eksote) produced a better result of EUR 3.4 million than planned in June.
The result of the exot was EUR 4.3 million in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where preventive services have been developed to bring down institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all operations.
This year, the Exote will seek to shorten the course of action.
The extremism covers the deficit previously created by the surplus.
The remaining proportion may be used to shorten lines and to buy measures for patients.
The total annual result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The government will discuss the six-monthly review at its meeting next Wednesday.
Immola, 70 special border icers sweared on the military whale.
Of the 70 backup officers at the Border and Marine Guard School, they swore a military whale on Friday.
A military election of the guards of the Border and Maritime Guard School took place in Immola on Friday.
The Tenth Special Border Jäger Course was held in the backup sports field.
The military whale swore 70 deputies.
Special border guards are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for a special border ice cream.
They were invited to the selection tests at 250.
Special frontiers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans from the border forces during the war were involved in the campaign.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
Veterans who took part in the event were born in 1918.
To a limited extent of looting ahead, criminal intelligence will help investigate and expose serious crime - ESS.fi
Each of the 11 Finnish police agencies has been operating as of the beginning of 2014 a RTA, i.e. a criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible to the outside.
In the Hämeen Police Department, the unit includes a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's drawn by a sergeant stationed in Lahti.
The chief of staff is in charge of Lieutenant Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in a civilian suit.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and need, sees Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides various explanations to the other police.
In confusion, for example, it has obtained information from asylum seekers.
The most recent reform of working methods
The establishment of analytical units is the most recent reform of police practices.
The aim was to prevent crime, i.e. to make it less and less frequent for the police to leave the wars only when the alarm is received.
The information collected and analysed by the unit is used to target day-to-day police activities where they are most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, a criminal intelligence centre was set up, less than three national units, and each police department had its own criminal intelligence unit.
The PTR centre in Vantaa, in connection with the Central Crime Police, will lead the activities at national level.
PTRs employ people from the police, from Customs and Border Guards, according to their name.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in divided areas, and their role is to provide information to both local police and national authorities.
Intelligence extends beyond its territory
Where an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, it is up to the RTA unit to know what is going on throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the limits of its own institution, because crime does the same.
Those who work in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
Through registers, an alert mission database and observations, the unit aims to draw the police's attention to new phenomena, productive crimes or crimes that resemble each other.
This is called serialisation, and it is one of the most important tools for criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it is honest or criminal.
Based on the practice, the author is a certain image.
The recording can be done either on the basis of a method of action or by a person, depending on which police officer has more information.
Criminals Learn From Errors
The employees of the RTA unit do not travel around the city with collars, but their work is not fully public either.
There is no report of the methods used by both the individual and the criminal, since it could lead to the development of professional criminal activities and thus to the prevention of police criminal activity.
The police publicly report these practices if they expect them to pose a threat.
For example, such a case was reported from the early summer, the mode of subscription of empty dwellings used for housing fractures.
That's where the people put the stick, pin or tape on the outside door, and they tried to see if the residents were really on their way.
The preliminary investigation material shall be made public at least to the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals are learning from their mistakes.
The smartest order are the District Court protocol, which shows, for example, that fingerprints have been found.
The next time we go to the thieves, we're going to get our gloves on.
The case has been interviewed by Deputy Police Commissioner Tero Seppa from Hämee Police, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärve from Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomela from Central Criminal Police.
Police collect and analyse information to plan practical action.
In the background of a reduction in labour and financial resources.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was the three-step PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside its own institution and the Finnish borders.
The schoolgirl who joined Daddy was killed in Syria in London.
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join Isis, is reportedly dead in Syria.
Counsellor Tasname Akunjee said that the girl's family heard this dead in Syria a few weeks ago.
On Thursday, ITV News reported that the girl was believed to have died in Russian air strike at Raqqa, a base of the organization on the ground.
He was 17 years old and, according to his family, he died just when he was planning to escape from the war to tear the country and return to Britain.
"It can only be hoped that the only benefit of the case is that it can act as a tombstone and as a will for others, that there are real risks of leaving the war zone - that it could make people give up making such a decision," Akunyee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other Eastern schoolgirls flew to Turkey, from which they boarded a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she had married an Isis fighter in Syria and that she became a widow only after a few months.
Reid says Clinton will consider Garland the Supreme Court candidate if he is elected.
Mr Reid, President of the Senate, says that he is convinced that Mr Hillary Clinton, the candidate for democratic president, will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected President.
The Republicans of the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Mr McConnell, President of the Senate's majority, says that the next President will elect the person to replace Mr. Antoni Scalia as the last Supreme Court member.
On Thursday at the phone conference, Reid said that he's predicting with some degree of certainty that Clinton will choose Garland.
The representative of Reid later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would appoint Garland and that it was speculation.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want "to swing the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the Grand Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeal in District of Columbia.
Reid said that Republicans holding back Garland's appointment are the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's "hands" and "possibles".
He said Trump wasn't fit for duty.
Treats says the nude calendar is "for women as well as for men."
Treats magazine cooperates with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they're going to find the next top model generation in their 2017 NU Mus calendar.
Mr. Treats President Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his paper with a lot of nude photos is different from the old school Playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently, he thinks that the calendar is for them, too.
"We have to start introducing timeless and classical nudity where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these naked images of the female body," Shaw said in a press release where the calendar was published.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful art.
The models can be left online or personally in open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl's destination: who actually buys records?
Single, middle-aged men love violets.
Before you rush to fill the comment with irritable insults, written by No.All Individual Men of Middle Ages, you will notice that this argument is based on real information.
According to YouGov, the new arrival of a lot of records is not due to the fact that more and more of those born in this millennium are excited about the novelty of physical objects, but about the middle-aged sound.
Apparently, those who have recently purchased the vinyl plate are most likely 45-54 years old.
In fact, most likely of all, they are part of a group of 18-24-year-olds who buy disks.
It is also not just a question of collecting practitioners, but also a matter of emotion: older shoppers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings inside (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy solitude (69% vs. 66%).
But is the results of YouGov true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me when I'm walking in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit. I'd be very quick to point out before I stop, I'd make a cup out of my hands and say something authoritative, like, "Let's take a closer look at it."
Let's take a closer look.
At the same time, while Soho's charm and dirt are slowly being removed, hotels, chain restaurants and shops and office equipment are now filling buildings where there were previously independent movements - a handful of specialized record stores still exist.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop filming for a moment when I stand very close to different men in some of these shops trying to assess their age and their emotion.
The Glasgow Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (number: two young women, three middle-aged men) at Reccles (number: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably twenty-five), spends my afternoon in London because of a meeting, and tours shops to spend a few hours.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
"Well, I am," he says.
I've got about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, which appear in the picture above (sent the sample by email, did not follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for obtaining such a huge amount of disk and singles is partly due to the income available to him: now he can buy records that he could not afford when he originally published them, and he can buy again the ones he sold when he was young and broke.
"A large part of the material I bought is from the late '60s and early '70s, disks that were published when there were 11 or 12, which I guess I was a little too young to get," he says.
He agrees that the buyers of disks are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company and adds, "I don't smoke or drink much.
This is my bad news."
25-year-old Wez, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets fit the YouGov profile.
But he has noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by media enthusiasm, people who have heard that the records have come back into fashion and who have come to need to buy back their old albums.
On the basis of the discussions I have had, people have generally been separated from their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyls to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their CDs back," he says.
This may explain an increase in the number of vinyl awakeners of certain age groups.
But what about the alleged emotional meaning of the records?
In a trade such as Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that disk stores offer a comforting community for similar types.
According to Wez, some older customers have been particularly injured by the close-payment system.
Some vinyl fans can become confused with the digital world and choose to trust the permanence of familiar disk files; objects that raise memories of the happy days of teen life.
"I think that sometimes it may be about filling a hole or some kind of comfort that you can own," Wez says.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe that it is true for many people.
It's an easy way to fill your mind.
"We're like their social workers!" the other employee suddenly said from the record.
The April ICM Opinion Survey revealed that almost 50% of people who had bought the vinyl plate in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a disc player that they never use, while 7% have no disc player.
In this point, the news report is likely to appear to have a serious concern when I browsed the stack of bossa nova collections.
This "winning"-view of the awakening is something that is also observed by Jonny, who is working at Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men).
"Somebody came in a while ago and said, "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a radiohead CD so we can put it on the shelf," he says.
This is not a big deal, but it is absolutely happening.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
So, not parents, but younger people, my late years, who are just getting excited about it.
In Foppi, where a layer is now reserved for violets, there is a much more diverse audience on my arrival.
Seven-seven-year-old couples, tourists taking photographs, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the above mentioned movements - the loudspeakers freshest Wild Beast's latest scapegoat and sex-like pop, and not improvisation jazz - it's great to see different customers.
None of them seem to be very lonely, but it's hard to prove a palpable psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Foppi for a few minutes looking at various different records on the market.
He's making window purchases, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn't make a lot of money, so collecting records isn't really an option.
"It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music either by computer or something else, but the beauty of the vinyl is..." he sighs in love.
"I don't know how to explain it, it's really unique."
My last stop is said to have raised a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
At the same time as I'm trying to see that I'm looking at cockroaches, I noticed a group of teenage girls gathering around Polaroid cameras for a moment before my father and daughter were thinking about buying Crosley's CD player.
On the left there is a stairs walled with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac albums: a mix of modern music and classics, the essentials of any average collection.
No one looks at them, maybe because they're just ornaments, and some are so high that it's impossible to touch them.
It's purely art vinyls.
But given that the small attention given to these items can mean more money to the industry and send some customers to Soho's cancers for more, there is not much to complain about.
It will not come as a surprise that the population that is more likely to have more time and money than others is also the one who spends most on luxury people, such as violets.
But while my findings suggest that youGov's results are correct at least in Soho's record stores, they do not rule out the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, in record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or office.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday mornings mowing around Berwick Street's record stores, browsing records and avoiding a creepy 30-year-old artificial TV drinker's eyes on this unsuspecting middle-aged man's shoulders.
Holker is the most living vertebrate animal video report
Scientists say that the holster has a longer life span than any other vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studied the sharks, says that the record is on a female that is believed to be between 272 and 512 years of age and is five metres long.
The French court rejects the application for the removal of trade from Jungle refugee camp
The French court has rejected the Calais authorities' request to cut down dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in Jungle's camp, where thousands of refugees live.
In court proceedings this week, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to dispose of all 72 temporary shops, where people sell cigarettes from within the camp to energy drinks, offer a haircut or sell tea by 50 cents (40 p.m.) or sell simple food by a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais Prefect Office justified that the premises should be decommissioned because they represent a tax-free parallel economy and because they are a risk of fire and cleansing.
The humanitarian groups have informed the court that trades and restaurants are vital, saying that free meals provided by a state-supported organisation and other groups do not provide enough food for the increasing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often offer protection and free meals for those who need them.
The Court of Justice in Lille stated that there were no legal grounds for evicting 72 people who ran temporary trade, but said that Calais's prefect's concerns were "extremely understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that the food shops, cafes and restaurants had a much greater role to play than just feeding people living in "extremely uncertain conditions".
He said that the facilities offered peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
The Jungle Book Kids' Cafe was one of the places under the threat of landing, whose activities are unprofitable and which offers 200 meals daily, English and French hours, and asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition to protect children’s coffee shop.
The letter sent to Guardian said that closing the cafe would be a disaster for these children, some of whom were only eight years old.
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in Jungle's camp has risen to 9,000 people - to peak - since the number of arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
Food prices fall significantly faster in Finland than in the EU average
Food is greatly cheaper in Finland for the benefit of consumers and the harm of producers.
In Finland, food prices have fallen by almost five per cent in three years, while in the EU on average their prices have fallen by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become 1% more expensive.
Over the last three years, food prices have fallen most in Finland from the EU countries with the same wage level as in Finland.
In Britain alone, food prices have fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are presented in the article by Ilkka Lehtinen, Director of Development of Statistics Finland, which was published in the Tieto & Trendit blog.
The magazine compared real prices, i.e. prices, with the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest data will be from June this year.
At the beginning of the 2010s, food prices increased sharply.
In 2013, prices fell close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came from EU membership," says Lehtinen.
Then there followed a turn, after which food has become cheaper year after year.
The bans on food imports imposed by Russia are now pressing the price, which has brought down food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and producer prices for agriculture have fallen.
“Putin’s policy has helped Finnish consumers in a short term,” says Lehtinen.
The increased price competition between industry and trade has also affected the fall in price.
Big chains of trade S-Group and Kesko have both dropped their prices.
For consumers, price competition has appeared to be outstanding advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not a place for affordable food, even though the food price has fallen greatly.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland in the EU, with a wage level similar to that in Finland.
According to Lehtinen, VAT is significantly affected by the price of food sold in Finland.
He found that if the analogue countries had the same VAT rate, Finland would sell the third cheapest food from similar countries.
The magazine compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate was seven in the comparative countries, only Germans and Dutch people would sell more cheap food than Finns.
"If we want to be able to reach the old EU countries at the price of food, we need to halve the value added tax to the EU countries' average level and continue to compete", Lehtinen writes.
The paper points out that the calculations he has made at the rate of the VAT rate are indicative.
School isn't quite the same anymore.
A person returning to school may find that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guide for all schools in Finland to operate.
Schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan sets out the official objectives.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from old ones in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of fiction is abandoned, and schools start to practice coding.
Swedish education starts in the sixth grade at the latest, and social education starts in four.
However, the greatest change concerns the role of students.
It used to be thought that a teacher teaches students, but now everyone has to be active and learn one another from another.
This is the way of trying to make school more interesting.
The world's longest vertebrate was found - an ice shark can live for up to 400 years
The well-known Greenlandese shark (Somniosus microcephalus) reaches sexual maturity only at 150 years of age.
It can live another 250 years after that, report a new study.
The figures make the species the longest vertebrate of today’s world.
In the animal, it is only passed by an Icelandic imposter whose oldest known individual has been scheduled to be 507.
Greenland sharks swim along the North Atlantic.
They also have a second record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
The females stretch the dogs longer, they can grow up to five feet [5 m].
Because the rate of growth is slow, it is estimated that only about a centimetre a year, adults have lived for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He determined the age of adult icefish of 28 females who had remained in the fishing gears.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radiocarbon sequelae of the eye lenses.
The mean age of treated sharks was at least 272 years.
The two largest fishes in the sample, 493 and 502 centimeters, were exposed to approximately 335 years of age and 392 years of age.
In view of the fact that in previous studies it has been found that there are only more than four metres of sexual maturity for the pedigree, the researchers calculated that they were about 150 years old at that stage.
Science published the study.
Stockmann fires almost 300 people. No salesmen are reduced.
Almost 300 employees are dismissed from Stockman, a department store.
Co-operative companies in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of the tie-ups, approximately 300 jobs are reduced, most of which will be made redundant," Stockmann explains in his bulletin.
It does not mean that the number of retailers in the goods sector will be reduced so that the customer service does not suffer.
In addition, some 80 workers in support functions are offered new jobs as a seller.
Stockmann's yt negotiations concerned some 3,000 workers.
At the beginning, it was estimated that there would be around 380 employees.
The reduction of the population is aimed at annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are due to take place next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
Stockmann's difficulties in getting profitable from the department store.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11,1 million in the second quarter, trade in goods remains a loss.
In Stockmann’s view, Lauri Veijalainen, CEO, said that sales in the goods sector have not reached the objectives set by the company.
"Personal reductions are unfortunately necessary to ensure the positive operating result of Stockmann Retail in 2018," Veijalainen says in the release.
In the second quarter, the result improvement was particularly driven by the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
Ketju achieved the best turnover and results for the second quarter of all time.
Lindex's operating profit increased to EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
Last year, the total operating result of Stockmann Group was 4.1 million in loss.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year will decrease last year.
The revised operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperature below 20 degrees throughout the country
The low pressure centre on the north of Finland will keep the weather rain on Friday, says Ilona Lag, meteorologist of HS.
There are also rainfalls in the middle of the country, but the southern part is vermin.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as mercury remains below 20 degrees throughout the country.
The northern rain areas remain at 10-15 degrees.
Kenya’s sports team is shaken by a strange explanation of the doping scandal at the coach’s pace.
Kenyan sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it became apparent that Anzrah appeared as a country team athlete in the doping test.
The news agency AP reported that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is a 800 - meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya’s National Team Command, told us that Anzrah’s identity was revealed after he gave a sample in the surprise test as Rotichina.
Doping officials reported to the Anzrah authorities.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because he was "prosecuting Kenya's country team".
He performed as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour", President of the Kenya Olympic Committee, Kip Keino, on the other hand, would hang on to the news agency Reuters.
The Olympics’ sport begins on Friday, and Rothish is scheduled to run immediately at that time.
It is not yet known whether there are known consequences for the runner.
Rotich placed last year in the World Cup on the way to the fourth and is ahead of Rio's winners.
According to Reuters, the source inside Kenya's sports team claimed that Anzrah was driving the athlete's accreditation card only to get free meals in the racing village.
When the antidoping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid to be exposed," the source told.
Where is everybody?
The Rio Sports Platform is rubbering its emptyness
Where is everybody?
Not at the Rio Olympic Stadium, at least, watching sports.
In Rio on Friday, a struggle started on the medals of sport, but the world’s top individuals were allowed to present their skills to an unscrupulous empty audience.
Rio’s organisers reported on Friday that only 58 percent of the first day’s morning tickets and 65 percent of the night’s tickets were sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium was bubbling about cheering people.
The finals' tickets are already sold out in Rio.
The Rio Olympic Loss has attracted attention even before sports.
For example, thousands of empty seats have been seen in the views of rugby, melonna, and horse riding.
When the Brazilian medallions Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the scene was filled.
After the Brazilian double, the Netherlands played against Russia, and 12 000 people were only filled with about 30 percent.
The bad moves are at least explained by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with economic problems, is a long way off for European and Asian competitionists, and many of the Olympics are strange for Brazilians who are used to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team could not have filled the football stadium.
Mario Andrada, informant of the contestants, told us that 82 per cent of the tickets had been sold at that time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million left to sell," said Andrada, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets of the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, although the tickets cost nearly half as much as Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have ranged from around EUR 9 to over EUR 1 000 for openings.
More than half of the tickets cost less than EUR 16.
At the Summer Olympics in London, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but this is not yet allowed in Rio, because organisers need money and are trying to get tickets sold until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organisers have given 240 000 tickets to less well - known species, such as golf and rugby, to schoolchildren in the country.
In Rio Stadium, there were plenty of empty places in the morning.
Even on the sand of the beach volleyball Copacabana, the audience has not been interested.

A new way to protect the environment - acquire the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation by means of new ways.
The Foundation established last year acquires ecologically significant natural sites.
After that, private, companies and entities can redeem their rights to land with money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land has been distributed virtually into blocks which those who wish to acquire rights against payment.
The holder obtains a veto in the size of 187 square blocks, which in practice means that every holder is not required to be approved if the use of the land is to be changed.
You can also acquire custody rights in several areas.
Acquisition of a right of administration is something concrete that can be left to an inheritance or given as a gift.
There is no need to go and carry banners or chain yourself to a place to protect nature," says Juha Levia fabric, who has acquired control over his company.
The acquirer obtains accurate location information from his or her branch, which allows for, for example, a visit to the section.
On the Foundation's website, the name of the acquirers of the right-holders will be found in the same map where the land block data can be found.
The only risk that the Foundation’s activities will change from its original idea is that it is protected by the bread fabric.
The Helsinki Foundation has been set up as a foundation of general interest to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the Foundation would operate in some way ethically or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation's Fairy project is the protection of natural habitats so that they can be intact and at peace.
The Foundation acquires land either by buying or by making donations.
It is mainly financed by the sale of ownership rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The aim of the Foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims beyond Finland's borders and plans to register from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in pop up forest at Helsinki shopping market on 13-19 August.
The cyclists torture the big cities of Turku the worst - see the situation in your municipality.
Cycling thieves torture Turku, one of the biggest cities in Finland.
This year, more wheels have been stolen in proportion to the population than in nine other major cities.
Helsingin Sanomat explained to the police the extent to which the ten largest cities have stolen bicycles and parts of bicycles per thousand inhabitants in the January to August of this year.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to the police, out of four to five bicycle thieves per thousand inhabitants.
Instead, only about two bicycle thieves per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police in Espoo and Kouvola.
It's a big difference.
"There are twice as many thefts in other cities as there are others," explains Tommi Reen, police inspector of the police department.
Turku's police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer to that.
“The frequency of threats can be influenced by the number of bikes in the city and the number of wheels in the city,” says Sergeant Teemu Kiäs.
Tommi Reen, the police government, is looking forward to the fact that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu are up to the top in comparison.
The number of bicycle thefts goes much further than the number of study and cycling cities.
Turku has a dense center, short distances and lots of wheels available for thieves.
"E.g. Espoo is a completely different type of city, where city centres are distant from each other and bicycles are not necessarily a priority vehicle," Reen says.
In the whole of Finland, there have been slightly less bicycle thefts in January to August than in the corresponding period of last year.
But there's no reason for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, the police report a little over 20,000 bicycle thefts per year.
It means 50 to 60 fillets every day, and only in Helsinki about 4,000 bikes per year.
"They're large quantities," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more wheels, for only some victims report theft to the police.
Reen calls on people to report the theft of a bicycle, although fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police can be found.
A typical solved wheel theft is where the police get information about the theft right away and the thief gets caught in blood.
"There are also other cases in the course of another investigation, where, for example, a drug case can find stolen wheels in the apartment," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bicycle thieves are caught on a weekly basis in the course of work or police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, wheels are stolen from bicycles, courtyards, warehouses and wheelchairs in shopping centres, for example, practically everywhere they are usually stored.
The most isolated bicycle models are stolen as in previous years.
The U-lock gives the wheel a better protection than many other types of lock.
Some thieves take the bike, for example, for their own short-term use, but a large part of the stolen wheels end up for sale on the Internet, for example.
They'll stay on the domestic market.
"At least it's not known to the police that a lot of stolen wheels are going abroad," Reen says.
According to the police, shoppers of stolen wheels are ordinary Finns.
Some of them must be buying a stolen bike without knowing.
Some may have doubts about that.
The buyer of the used bike must be careful, for he or she may be guilty of a disguised crime or offence.
"The alarm clocks should ring if the good-art bikes are sold down," Reen says.
Special librarian Sever Hirvi carries his colorful Nops for all his working days to protect the Kallio library in Helsinki.
He's had five wheels, but no one's been stolen, says. "Never been taken, there's been a good monk."
"It may not be so attractive to the thieves; there may not be a hipster value here," the Helsinki Hurvi wonders.
In the Kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, Sioni Valve locked his bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now, the bike was sitting against the wall of the Kiosk, but usually Valve is locking his bike in something solid, like a wheel rack.
"There will be quite a lot to think about, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," says the Helsinki student on her white bike, whose body alone cost about EUR five hundred.
"All the time, you hear from your friends that the wheels have been taken."
"mostly bad wheels, like scum jops."
A bike was stolen from the guard from the inside of the building company a year ago.
Although the wheel had not been locked up, Valve was waiting to catch it.
Under 15 years of age to be held responsible for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer-reviewing teams from the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer-review team is being tested to prevent young people from entering the crime scene.
At first, the experiment will apply to people under 15 years of age who are now without criminal liability.
The peer review team is missing the first young person to commit a crime.
The idea is that the peer review team will discuss what happened with the offender and impose sanctions.
A week later, the offender may himself join the peer review team to make up for his actions.
There may be other consequences, for example, of a letter written to the family explaining what has become done and what has been learned from it.
The youth director, Tommi Laitoo, says that the model is not strict.
We have other compromise models that are used alongside.
"All are directed towards a more responsible course of action of a young person, so that everything is not ruined by the first mistake," says the Department.
A model of the United States of America has been adopted on the peer-review team, where it is widely used.
The idea is that the young person, after his first crime, will not be exposed to an adult panel, but will reflect on what has happened with approximately the same age.
They've tried the model once.
The service designer Iikka Lovio of Palmu, who followed the experiment, reported that it was an abuse that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes committed by people under 15 have not necessarily been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message to continue on the road you chose," Lovio says.
The peer-review team is part of the Helsinki project of immigrant youth, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new approaches are offered to all those in need, not just young immigrants.
More than 70 Republicans want the party to stop financing Trump's campaign.
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop financing Donald Trump's presidential election campaign.
The letter was published by the U.S. newspaper Politico, who had got it to see the draft.
According to the press, the open letter is addressed to the President of the Republican National Committee, Mr Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to be directed to Congressionals instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump and his disregard, incompetence and record disapprovals threaten to bring a tone to the Democrats in these elections," says the letter according to Politico.
Only the direct allocation of all possible funds to the Congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning with Trump-enhanced anchor in their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election are falling day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is due to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the persons organized by the letter is apparently Republican Andrew Weinstein who opposes Trump.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from 'people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress' and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists a number of Donald Trump’s acts, which are believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he was said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for U.S. families with children
In the United States, Mr Hillary Clinton, the candidate for democratic president, told us about the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I am trying to be president so that the US economy can go well for everyone.
"Clinton said in his speech, Donald Trump seeks to be president, so that the economy can go well for him and his friends."
At the centre of the Clinton plan is a massive five-year programme of $275 billion to improve US infrastructure, bridges and airports.
This would be partly financed by rich tax increases, partly by private money.
The building program is a hand-hold for the American dounars who suffer from the move of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme the largest investment in good paid jobs after World War II.
We are a builder, we must return to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of working families with children.
On Thursday, she sounded like Sanders, stressing that the rich should pay a fair share of the taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States for tax-retirement, it'll have to pay the tax, then Clinton said.
Today he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he used to support.
"As President, I am against any trade agreement that acts against employees or wages," Clinton promised.
According to the speculations published by The Washington Post before Clinton's speech, Clinton intended to criticise the economic program published by Republican Donald Trump on Monday for "responsible only millionaires of this type".
The scrape proposed by Trump to corporate tax has previously been called "Trump loophole" by Clinton.
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded the audience of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has failed to pay, and the clothes Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start making his own products in America," Clinton poked.
These are the Rio ratings: The competitions have not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile application is of interest to
Usually, sports races are shown in television viewer statistics as the sharpest mountain peaks.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not reached extreme numbers of viewers.
On one occasion, at best 12 per cent of the population has been glued to the screens: on Tuesday night, Ylen's swimming was followed by 615 000 viewers from the Olympic Channel TV2 at the same time.
For comparisons: the EM competitions of general sport, one month ago, attracted nearly 800 000 viewers to TV2 at a time, and the EM competitions of football were quite another million.
So far, the Olympics have been most interested in cycling Sunday night and the fifth day of the race, both of which reached almost half a million viewers at one time.
The top sports chief, Panu Pokkinen, is pleased with the ratings and reminds us that, for the first time in the Rio Olympics, the viewers are divided into several different instruments.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympics from Rio Arena.
We are pleased to see how much TV viewers choose the Olympic Games in general.
On the side of TV, even the viewers share TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports competitions Yle has dedicated a whole channel to.
When the shipment arrives 24 hours a day and the viewers are from 20 000 to 500 000 all the time, it is a good base.
The number of viewers is smaller than in 2012 London or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is explained in part by the time difference - a large proportion of the shipments in Rio will be in Finland during the night.
Another reason for a lack of interest - if someone considers that it is now thin - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken one of the surprise medals from the opening, the interest would have rang up with it.
In addition, sport is only about to begin, as are other species of interest to Finnish people: sailing and horse riding.
According to Pokkiinen, the numbers from the beginning have been close to what was expected.
When the sport begins, the ratings explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the competitions, which rose in the first days of the competitions at Apple App Store for the most download free of charge in Finland.
By Monday, the app was loaded 150,000 times.
I'd say we're already on the road to 200,000 downloads.
"The numbers of the network are only available later," says Pokkinen.
Rio Areena has not acted as desired by all users.
Pokkinen says that feedback has come and that the errors have been corrected.
There has been a delay in using Rio Areena and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
An updated version has been produced of the applications, which should correct errors.
The Rio Olympic Games will be shown in the Ylen Canal and the arena more widely than any other sports event ever before.
You can follow some species from the Yle Fem channel, and on the radio Yle Pue broadcasts the races daily.
Not only are the Olympics perhaps the most laboring for the High Never, but also the last ones that can only be traced from the High Channel.
From 2018, Olympic sports will be shown on Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is your Sun, whose depth is 95,3 metres on the Crossback.
It may be even deeper.
The technical training teacher Matti Kannela found a 20 - square - foot [20 sq m] mass on the Crossback, the bottom of which was shown by a dive computer of 104 metres.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environmental Centre tried in vain to confirm the observation by echoing.
The method may not find a small deepening in 100 meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95,3 metres.
Other deep lakes are Inarijärvi (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 metres).
Over 80 metres from Saimaa, Reisvesi and Main Lake.
They have not been studied as closely as Sunshine.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
"There might well be some unknown depths," Kannela wonders.
If the deepest lake is determined by the central depth, it is the Great Lake Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
In this way, your Sun will not enter the ten deepest, and Suvasvesi will be further away from the top.
Correction on 12 August at 14.29: Repair of the last piece, where the deepest lakes were wrong at the heart of its heart.
Deprived tax sector: Increased taxation of pensioners
The taxation of pensioners remains tighter than for employees.
Ihalainen says that the malpractice appeared under the parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to those of employees.
This is not included in the Government's proposal.
We believe it should definitely be there.
The promises made should continue after the elections, he says to the West Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received income reductions, which reduced taxation.
The matter was heated in the parliament by the opposition representatives who were polishing the then Minister of Finance Alexander Stubb from the electoral promises.
Buying power will be secured, it will not grow
According to the Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo's (cf.), tax reductions are mainly about protecting and increasing purchasing power, as next year's wages will not be increased.
He says that the tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with the messages from Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Orpo about the desire to respect the competitive agreement that has been reached.
He says that maintaining the treaty is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government.
It has been done by social organisations, so it must not be called into question.
It will be needed because the economy is so much dependent on domestic demand and people's own future faith.
Transmissible to prolonged unemployment
An admirer appeals to the government to tackle long-term unemployment in the budget gap, at least to halt its growth.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed was about 17,000 higher than one year earlier.
He says that if the growth does not stop, the government's goal of raising the employment rate to 72% will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of long-term unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social fall in the promise.
Ambassador: There are no Finnish victims in Thai attacks
Last night and last night, at least four people were killed during the bombings in Finland.
The Embassy calls on Finnish residents to be alert and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finnish tourists to withdraw their journey to Thailand because of the explosions, but we should be careful to follow the instructions of the embassy, says Westphalen.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although it is difficult to estimate their exact number.
The travel period of Finnish residents to Thailand dates from the beginning of the year.
The vast majority of Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook since the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach out to the Finns in Hua Hin in particular in order to find out about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
Generally speaking, everything seems to be fine, says Westphalen.
Could not close temporary folder: %s
According to Westphalen, there's no record of the target yet.
The Ambassador believes that the events may be linked to the political unrest of Thailand's divided society and last week's referendum on the constitution of the military train.
The Act was adopted by referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who declared themselves against the law.
In the southernmost regions of Thailand, ethnic-national conflict related to the Muslim population, says Westphalen.
Muslims want to increase their right to self-determination.
However, earlier attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big local holiday in Bangkok today, says Westphalen.
According to him, the city celebrates Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very limited.
The impact of the attacks on the day's course will be such that the authorities will be very careful about safety.
Thai Police: Attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, attacks are "local sabotage" and are different from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism is also excluded, says Thai police according to AP.
At least four people have died in Thailand during the day when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as those popular with tourists in Phuket and Hua Hin.
Also popular with Finnish tourists, the holiday island Phuket exploded four bombs in the night, says Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current data, they did not require death victims.
Two of the bombs went off in Patong Beach, according to the newspaper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded according to the newspaper.
According to the local authorities, in the popular tourist destination Hua Hin, a total of four bombs have exploded yesterday and today.
In both double-bomb attacks, at least one died.
In addition, in southern Thailand, Surat Than village, and in the city of Trang, at least one bomb exploded.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many travelers, as it leads to Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao Holiday Island.
Unknown impactor
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the Thailand-based military train, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not make people panic any more, he said to the reporters.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister for Security, Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least Hua Hin and Trang are connected.
He told the BSB that the intention of the authors was to destroy tourism in the country, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy calls on Finnish residents to be alert and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finns going to Thailand to cancel their journey because of the explosions, but the embassy's instructions should be followed with caution, says Westphalen.
Europeans affected
For the time being, very little is known about the attacks and their victims during the Finnish night.
Last night's attack in Hua Hin has given us a little bit more time.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
At least among the wounded are Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were injured in the second attack by Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded near the bell tower known as the attraction.
Thai PBS reports that the police have isolated the area in Hua Hin, where he believes he's found another bomb.
According to the governor of the county, Surat Than's bomb was hidden in the flower closet.
The municipal employee died in the attack.
There's at least one wounded.
The chief of police interviewed by CNN reports that two bombs were also used in Surat Than's attack, which exploded about half an hour apart.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs went off in front of two different police stations.
The United States Party won the Four of Women
The U.S. Alexandra Raisman was second to points 60.098 and the Russian Alija Mustafinna third to 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, is still in the Rio Championships for telecommunications with perman, jump and boom.
Biles has ruled women's gymnastics to a degree in the past few years.
He's got eight personal world titles from three previous years.
He has won the four-game and permanto championships three times in a row, as well as the boom last and second year.
The U.S. team has reached two World Championships in the Biles team.
The Biles have darker MM medals and jumps and booms.
Thai Finnish entrepreneur: "The person has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs the real estate agency in Thailand Phuket and the children's play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I do not believe that this will result in anything more wonderful, the Huovila who has been working as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many of the tragedy that has been experienced near Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then avian influenza and last year a bombing in Bangkok.
Even if they've never banished tourists before, I don't think this is.
Huovila’s office is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
Huovila heard about the attack from his own employee.
The employee called at about nine o'clock in local time and said he shouldn't come to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach street and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been set up because of the queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's celebration in Thailand.
Patong had a calm atmosphere, and the main street movements were allowed to open at about 10 a.m. local time.
On the beach, a lot of people hadn't even heard of the attacks.
During the third day of Thailand, traffic in Patong had become normalized and a large part of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the impact site, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila, who was at the strike site.
Later, the car was seen in the Kruunupy on the Jouxholm Road.
When the police arrived, the car was set on fire.
The patrol discovered two men with a conscience mark hiding in a nearby six.
The other man was captured immediately.
One of them ran away, but later they found him in the woods using a cop dog.
Men are suspected of using a motor vehicle, theft and gross injury.
The police are grateful to those who gave the clues.
Director of Research on Russian leadership changes: Clear deportation
In Russia, the highest-ranking leadership change was made on Friday, when President Vladimir Putin dismissed the Head of his regime, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is a civilized 44-year-old Anton Vago.
He's an ex- diplomat. He was Ivanov's number two man.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov’s separation can be Putin’s desire to prevent strong people from gathering too much power around him.
He adds that the recycling of management tasks is a way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from building up a power independent of the President.
According to the Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been crammed or screwed up with other leaders.
Station drop to Ivanov
Ivanov, who is part of Putin's inner circle, is taking up specific tasks in environmental and transport matters.
With the state media, Putin said change into a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to be transferred to other positions and suggested that he replace Vaino, reported Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that, from Ivanov's point of view, this is a clear downfall.
The environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of the Russian rule.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the Security Council of the President.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union at the KGB.
He was considered possible as a successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old map, such as the governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Katri Pynnöniemi, Senior Researcher from the Institute for Foreign Policy, says that it is more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place that Putin will change his neighbourhood to younger people.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield as they retreated in Syria.
They used civilians as a human shield when they fled to the city of Jarabulus to avoid targeting them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters received about 90 percent of the important city of Manbij.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists were left in the city at that time.
Revised earlier news at 7:30: In the past, we misbehaved to tell the civilians that they were fleeing the city, in fact, the Isis fighters kidnapped civilians when they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's public policy is against the law
The guidelines of the Ministry of Interior on the publication of documents are illegal, says Professor of Public Law Tomi Voutilainen of the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutilainen says to the STT that the publication of documents cannot be based on the Authority's own guidelines but is based on the law.
The Ministry of Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants in the Minister of Interior's events to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision under the guidance of the Office of the Government and the fact that the information had been entered in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Ministry's Communication Director tells the STT that the need to reform practices has been noted in the Ministry.
Usain Bolt's final Olympic show starts in Rio
Like in the last few years, Bolt has been running for time under the precious races.
From the beginning, he broke his way back and had to skip Jamaica’s Olympics.
This has not been a complete preparation, but I am in much better shape.
I've been practicing well, and that's the key thing, and Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included small-scale samba dancers and fans.
Around Porina Bolt, the Yamian star has risen over a period of time in which sport has been struggling with doping scandals and skating interest.
Bolt’s previous defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he was cut off in the 200 - foot [200 m] primer at 21.05.
At that time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by injuries and loose training.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred feet [100 m] by which he crushed the world record and his competitors’ confidence in the final event, despite being born at the time of 9.69 C.E.
It's harder than this.
A year later, at the Berlin World Cup, Bolt reached his career at the point of law.
World records, born in Berlin, are still valid at 9.58 a.m. and 19.19 a.m.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is pursuing a 200-metre world record and a 19-second understatement, but no one believes that it is just Bolt himself.
Satasella Bolt's great challenger is the Olympic winner of Athens 2004 Justin Gatlin.
Last year at the Beijing World Cup Bolt defeated an American in just one hundredths of seconds.
During its reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost even once in the finals of the prizes if only he has made his way.
In Dägur, the World Cup of 100th in 2011 was missed from Bolt because of a false departure.
Bolt will be over 30 in a week.
He's an old man in a young man's race, and Rio's competitions are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London as the final goal of his career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the others.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But whenever I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Shows about Rio: Two athletes are suspected of a doping offense
According to Xinhua, the Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has provided a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi found traces of prohibited substances on the doping sample.
Bulgarian drinker Silvia Danekova is also suspected of a doping offense.
In addition, the Kenyan sports coach was sent to my home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of an epo hormone.
He was in Rio for the fourth time in a 100-metre female butterfly.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estaio, the Chinese fin has taken its doping case to the International Court of Appeal of Sports CAS.
Xinhua says that the sample Xinyi gave on Sunday would have found signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
There have also been other doping suspicions in Rio.
The BBC reports that Bulgarian female drinker Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of epo hormone.
Kenya has, in turn, been sent home by a sports coach from Rio because of a doping offense.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee KOK reported that the Kenyan coach had become a sportsman in the test situation and had given a doping sample for this.
According to the media, this is Kenyan fast-track coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had been using Ferguson Rotich's race pass for 800 metres.
There's no stopping Phelps... no history of gold came out of the show.
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swims 200 meters apart 22nd Olympics in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympics.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to reach the Olympic gold of the same species in the fourth consecutive races.
Phelps' payout was 1.54.66.
The Japanese Kosuke Hagino placed in a blending second before the Chinese Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, and Helen Skelton, the BBC Olympic Commander, is laughing at an interview in the Evening Journal.
The case of Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read events of this week's Evening Magazine website.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton will not be very stressed if there is a small amount of noise in the media or in the media about his revealing and special outfits.
Well, television's a visual media, he insists.
Skelton is dressed in high-interest shoes and in a short dress that will certainly have at least sufficient exposure - at least to the eyes of a number of conservative British soys.
However, there are no back steps.
It's important to look good, and small judges are just a funny thing.
I'm sure Skelton wants to be alarmed and perhaps startled, but he insists that he doesn't want to be in the main role.
This isn't about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus needs to be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the court has reached Finland?
I can't, but everything that's paying attention to how hard these swimmers are doing work and how big sacrifices they make is okay with me, Skelton is whining.
You know what?
It's a scream about nothing if it comes from the dress of a drunkard.
I'm a little bit amused if you've hit someone's radar like this.
Rio P.D. Two arrests due to a terrorist suspicion.
On Thursday, the Rio Police reported two arrests due to a terrorist suspicion.
The police made arrests in connection with the safety oversight of the competitions.
In the same context, the police made five other arrests and questioned two persons before their release.
All suspects have been Brazilians.
According to the G1 news page, persons arrested for terrorism belong to the same group already arrested by the police in July.
The arresters are believed to have links to the Isis extremist organization.
The arresters had been reportedly provocative of violence in social media.
Messages calling for violence had been disseminated, among other things, in the WhatsApp service.
The safety of the Rio Championships is 85,000 policemen.
The police blew up a suspicious package in Rio.
Spain and Nigeria had to start their game at the beginning of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
The police found a suspicious package of basketball arenas and closed the place to the public.
The police let the public in after the controlled explosion of the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics when the police carried out a controlled mission of explosion.
The police shut down the arena because of the suspicious package they found there.
The public got in when the police had been controlled to blow up the package.
The audience did not record the scene by the start of the fight, because the police closed it down because of the suspicious package found at the arena.
The police blew up the package and let the public into the hall only after that.
The drink awoke the competitions to the Spanish team that started the dream.
With two defeats, the Spanish starter won Nigerian points 96-87.
In the last two races, Spain reached silver.

The Argentinan lady stabbed Cheater-Siren - the Finnish was considering the protest.
The wind of Cheater-Siren had a colorful day in Rio.
The wind of Cheater-Siren was hard on Thursday.
The Argentinan lady stabbed the Wind of Traitor-Siren in Rio on Thursday at the opening of the women's surfing day.
There was a clear breach of the wind.
The opponent admitted the crime.
He got stuck because of the accident, and the others ran away, Joakim Wilenius, the Finnish chief coach, told me.
The athlete thought about the protest for a long time.
Then it was not worth doing so, as it would have been futile according to the Olympic rules.
I should have dropped in the water so I could get some credit, Traitor-Siren said.
The Finnish hanging on their board to the last, because they didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
Finland remained in place 27 with the crash.
The 2012 Olympic Silver Medal in London is the eighth in the overall situation.
In terms of pain, the accident didn't affect much.
It's a big day on Friday when you're racing 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Traitor-Siren did not protest.
7 specialities, which according to science extend age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These matters have been proven to bring more years into the person’s life.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect the person’s health so that his life lengths.
On the other hand, sometimes things that a person cannot influence can bring him more years.
These include a tendency to moderate obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can lead to an increase in age.
You don't always have to do that, you know, just pick up a can of milk.
The secret of longevity has been sought to investigate many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest research results.
According to science, all these things may lead to more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee has been found to protect against cancer, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
Harvard University research found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a "lower risk of death", particularly as regards neurological or cardiac diseases.
Now, on behalf of alcohol, there are studies that show that the use of justice - from one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived as parents as people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of toothpaste can prolong a person’s life by up to six years, says one study.
The argument is based on the fact that this prevents gum infections.
On the other hand, they can contribute to the onset of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway found out how laughing had an impact on human life.
More than 54 000 people were monitored by a project lasting seven years.
Those who laughed more were more than 35 percent more likely to survive when the experiment ended.
Sex, when the protection against sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, is, according to many studies, good for health.
In addition to everything, it can also prolong the life span.
Unfortunately, just having sex as it is is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years of his life, he should also have an orgasm.
Mobility, of course, will bring more years, and it will not be denied.
However, reaching a long-term age does not require absolute alkalinity.
A study at Oxford University found that women with a big ass had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study combined these factors with lower mortality.
Whether it was an athlete or an actor who won the Olympic medals, he would be more likely to live longer than a normal bull.
A lot of research has been trying to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring his life more years.
Some scientists suspect, however, that a long life is due to a person's social status - which, for its part, makes it possible, for example, to seek recognition such as the Nobel Prize.
A study on shopping behaviour in people over 65 years found that the person shopping daily, i.e. likely to make shopping less frequent.
This is due to the fact that spinning in specific trades reduces loneliness.
Once again, it has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that might speed up death.
So count the credit card from your hand, so online shopping doesn't have the same effect.
Drunkard's drink went off in the truck.
There was a serious car accident on Friday night in Koske, Southwest Finland.
The accident took place in Koskke, mid-Friends and Sorvastonie at 9 p.m. on Friday.
The truck had been driving towards Forssa when the received passenger car had hit the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the crash, the truck was up to its stripes, but it burned.
The driver managed to turn off the fire himself.
The passenger car went down into the ditch and then over the well to the roof.
A woman born in 1972 who carried a passenger car remained under pressure in her car.
The rescue unit removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to Turku University Hospital for treatment.
The result of the female blow test was 2.02 miles.
He's suspected of being drunk in a car.
The mail sent loose candy to the wrong city.
There were deficiencies in the range of K-Citymarkets in Salon because the mail had accidentally delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki.
On Thursday, Teija Halltia was buying loose candy from Salon K-City Market when a fun sign hit my eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in bulk because Posti delivered our load to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when the Post delivers the load!
So if you don't get the traffic on the lawn cut, the sign says it.
The tuxedo sign of the merchant relates to the fact that the Post expanded its services last spring to include lawnmowers.
Weed cutting is offered by Post until the end of August.
Haltia felt that the sign was mainly amusing and decided to share it in social media.
The popularity of the update hit me with a big surprise.
The media, too, have been calling all along, and the attention that has been drawn to this is incredible, Mr. Hallia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia's update had more than 700 distributions on Facebook.
Hallia got her own favorites caught in a loose box, even though some of them were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the business of the transport services of the Post companies, was sorry for the damage to Ilta-Sanomom.
The background is that three of the five stage were lost yesterday in the wrong place (Senajoki), and we no longer went to the sub-delivery (Salo) by three, but only today we took five stages, and Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
It's the first news item in the evening news.
Teija Hallt did not get mad at the sign because she found all her own freeware favorites in the selection.

Backlund’s pair of pre- and post-supervised comments have been collected from the contributors.
I mean, you're amazing.
The same way we're on our way, motivation hard!
Pia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the project We're doing it now.
I get a terrible amount of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures while I'm on the same journey, the other one tells me.
In the spring, Lotto dropped the last kilos on the project now.
At that time, he told the Evening magazine that he wanted to finally get to the normal weight, which was then ten pounds [10 kg].
During the three - month fitness period, five pounds finally fell.
The hope of a murdered woman's family in Loviisa: the memory of the victim for the benefit of the police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim would be remembered instead of flowers and addresses by donation for the benefit of police work.
Sipoon Veterinary Station has published an Facebook update in which it conveys the wish of the victim's family for donations for police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipoo Veterinary Office and had also carried out his nursing training there.
The veterinary station remembers her with words that touch her.
Happy, smart, sense of humor and work fearless.
A good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update states that all donation money goes to police dogs, first and foremost to purchase safety vests.
Last Friday, 42-year-old Loviisa was murdered in her own courtyard in Koskenkyla, Loviisa.
The women's neighbors have told the evening paper that the victim was very much in love with animals.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and flowers.
A 27-year-old man who was suspected of murder didn't know a woman and had no connection with each other.
The killer's tracking involved a police dog Börje, who was life-threateningly wounded in the arrest.
But the Börje survived and is recovering.
The Circumstances condemned Post for breach of the Equality Act
The post was not entitled to suspend the salary of the employee who refused to study the temporary worker, and the district court of Kanta-Häme in its judgment did not.
The district court ordered Post to pay the worker most of the paid salary arrested and EUR 2 000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, the Posti could have arrested only part of the employee’s salary, which was responsible for the part of the study work throughout the day.
According to the Circumstances, the employee was placed in a more favourable position on the basis of his trade union activity, contrary to the Equality Act.
The staff member had complied with the PAU's decision on the ban on access to information by the Union for Postal and Logistics.
During last November's postal strike, PAU made a decision that Posti's employees would not be familiar with renters who broke the strike.
First, the People's News told us about it.
Returning Turkey to a way that respects human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, written by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (ps.) in his reply to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In its earlier letter, the Journalist Union asked Sipil and Soil to express their concern for the freedom of expression and the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini report that Finland has repeatedly brought to Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and freedom of expression.
Putin dismissed the commander of his regime to replace the Estonian-based Vauso
Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired Sergei Ivanov, Head of the Presidential Administration, says.
The Soviet-Viro Communist leader, Karl Jaco's grandson, Anton Vaino, will be here.
He is a 44-year-old diplomat who has served as Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, the news office of Interfax tells us.
Vladimir Putin fired the chief of his administration.
According to the Kremlin press release, Ivanov, who is part of Putin's tight inner circle, will be transferred to specific tasks in environmental and transport matters.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to be transferred to other positions and suggested that he replace Vaino, says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet occupation of the KGB.
Many considered Ivanov as a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Mr Ivanov was appointed President in 2011 before Putin was re-elected President in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant acquisition of the game ban is not seen in the opening of Valioliga
The world record of football transfers will not be seen on the field when Valioliiga is kicked in the weekend.
Paul Pogba's game ban followed along with England.
The Manchester United giant acquisition of Paul Pogba will be sidelined by the ManU on Sunday against Bournemouth due to a gambling ban, BBC reported on Friday.
According to the British media, the Italian Society of Pogba paid EUR 105 million to Juventus.
However, the F.A.F. is keeping him out of the game because Pogbale was burdened with the game ban on Juventus.
He received two warnings in the last season's Italian Cup, and it'll be a one-game game ban.
That game ban has been moved to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is on the second round of the league on August 19th, when ManU meets Southampton.
Flow of grandeur is a virtue
The exact criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have established the Flow Festival position as an internationally appreciated event by the world’s top artists.
The Flow Festival begins on Friday in Helsinki.
Festarians typically express themselves by their own dress.
One of the top stage artists is punk legend Iggy Pop this year.
The Flow Festival event area is ranked with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to have just the main stage and the beer, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival in the Summer of Helsinki this weekend has grown from a small block festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The simple question behind success is: What kind of event would the authors themselves want to go to?
It's kind of strange in the incestrums, that's what we're thinking.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with official regulations, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would be here this year to sell it out.
The aim was to increase the number of visitors in the last year's 70,000 people by 5,000.
Even this year, a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists will be seen at the festival.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because there is something to be funded in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle, which is controlled by huge routes.
That's not what we want.
The ideology of the successful event has been expanded over 13 years with 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurants and drinking bars in the partially artificial grassed area.
In addition to the main platform and smaller performance platforms, 15,000 people's tents work this year.
Kallio admits that the event could be implemented more simply.
Maybe I'm a little bit of a magistrate, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If you lose it, it's not our thing anymore.
The greatest pleasure and reward for the work done for Kallio is that today, even great visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event in the middle of the 21st century, activities depended very much on the support of the City of Helsinki of Helsinki for some 20 000 euros.
Last year, the turnover of the company running Flow was around EUR 6 million.
It can create "creepy things", like building that 73-metre wide tent.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves with their own self-righteous clothing.
In addition to the music event, you can talk about the trendy adult community of young adults.
However, the event is not deliberately profiled as a particularly fashionable one.
We want to break up, above all, with the contents.
Nevertheless, fashion phenomena also fit into Flow's values: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the top stage artists is the legend of the tick, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
A man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer of the festival that combines indierock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was struck because it is likely to be the last time that this will be seen at the concert in Finland.
We're all interested in history and the future.
Not just what they call on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest record is damn good, and he's been doing some damn good work over the last few years.
The bombs of Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in the purses, the tourists fled horrendously.
In Hua Hin, two bombs exploded during the local time on Thursday night.
At least one local woman died in the attack and over 20 were injured.
Apparently, the bombs were hidden in a purse and blown up using cell phones.
The bombs were placed on a street most of whose clients are foreigners.
They were blown up at the same time as tourists started leaving the bars and returning to their hotels, the police representative said, according to the CNN of Samoa Yoosumran.
Since 1989, a wild animal protector named Edwin Wiek, who lived in Asia, gave a much-speaking picture of the attacks.
If the TV isn't showing up properly, you can watch it here.
Of those injured in Hua Hin, at least 11 were foreign tourists.
The people were running against me and said that the bomb had exploded at the bar.
It happened on one of the biggest bar streets, told Swedish tourist Emlie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded at Surat Than, local time.
At least one died.
The number of injuries is not yet known.
Very soon after this, even the Finns preferred two bombs on Phuket Island.
No one's dead, apparently.
At the same time, there was another double-bomb attack in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in Trang City.
The police reported that they found at least one bomb in Hua Hini that had not yet had time to explode.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely rebel troops behind the bombings that are not satisfied with the activities of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, it may also be criminal organisations.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently become very busy with the activities of criminal organisations involved in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new standby team will go to battle first in a war situation
In an acute war situation, military officers are only ordered after several months of taking a military oath, says the Central Finn.
According to the Chief of Defence Training of the Defence Forces interviewed by the newspaper, Brig-Gen Jukka Sonninen, for example, of 5,5 months of service in war situations, only those who are in the final stages of their training are combatable.
According to the Head of Education, the service will first be assigned to the reserve staff.
No backup or reserve is ordered to carry out a task that has not been provided with the required training, says Sonnen.
Earlier in the summer, it appeared that the Defence Forces will start training the guards for immediate preparedness units from next year.
If necessary, the units may be used for military operations already during the training of the guard.
Pamela Tola received a huge payment from the home house.
Actor Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough fight in the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of a two-storey separate house had been EUR 330 000.
However, after trade, there was a serious moisture problem in the house that caused a dangerous microbial growth in health.
The couple had to sell the dwelling as a disintegration in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132 000, so the financial loss for Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198,000.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a discount from the seller.
The salesman denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case both in district court and court court.
Court of Justice delivered judgment on the case on Wednesday.
It maintained the judgment of the district court, which ordered the seller to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150 000 for a price reduction.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 344 for the trial and settlement expenses of the couple.
The right to a price reduction was a bit reasonable, as the purchasers had already been aware of the need to repair the dwelling when making the sale of the dwelling.
However, according to the court’s law, the errors in the building were significantly more serious than had been presented.
Tola was looking for a good home.
Tola told me in court that the couple had been looking for a good home because they did not want to go to repair work.
He had come to the conclusion that the building was renovated and in good condition and that the points mentioned in the health check report were not harmed.
The fitness check report mentioned as risks and disadvantages of ventilation and the lack of adequate management of rain and melting water through rock studies.
However, the discussions did not reveal that this was an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma thought that rainwaters from the rock might need to be controlled a little over a few years.
The trades were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it turned out that housing moisture problems were much more serious than they thought.
The inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 showed microbial growth in the building, which, according to the Witnesses, was due to both the rainwaters of the rock and the land moisture that had risen in capillary.
On the west side of the house, the air contaminated by the microbes was estimated by the inspector to be able to reach the indoors through the porch.
The homeroom, the basement stairs, the living room window breaker, and the basement washroom were found in test samples to allow a health risk.
The terraces were built without permission
The Court also contested whether the building permit had been extended.
The Court considered that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the City of Espoo’s decision to make any illegal changes to the building before the transaction.
Among other things, the terraces had been built even though there were no appropriate permits.
However, home problems were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Justice, according to the information received from the seller before trade, buyers could assume that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need for measurable repairs in the near future.
In the view of Tola and Waroma, there was no particular reason for the Court to carry out a more extensive inspection than usual.
The purchasers have not failed to comply with their obligation to report, the Court of Justice states in its judgment.
Scary archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to have children in the Nazi register, including Finns
The editor, Christopher Andersson, writes in his recent article on Dagens Nyheter, how the National Archives in Maryland in the United States have recorded documents on microfilms concerning a total of 218 500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are Germans, but they also include Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian, 14 Finnish, and 31 Swedish women wanted Nazi morality.
The documents and registration cards come from a racial agency in Nazi Germany.
The agency worked under the command of SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS-man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS-doctor.
The same applies, to an even greater extent, to women who had to be able to bear up to 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynecological studies were carried out in women to find out.
The racial agency studied women’s backgrounds, for example, by studying church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the female family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up Swedish citizenship and to give birth control reports and good recommendations from close relatives.
The agency wanted guarantees that women were "loved children", "saves", and "good national socialists" who knew very well German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as bridesm of SS men.
It doesn't tell you what happened to the 14 Finnish women who found in the archives.
SS leaders set up a state-supported programme known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The programme provided, among other things, for each SS man to have four children, whether married or outside.
The Lebensborn Homes take care of children born outside marriage and their mothers.
However, the programme was not very actively promoted; it is reported on the pages of the U.S. Holocaust Museum.
Instead, Nazi demographic policy focused on family and marriage.
The State encouraged marriage by providing loans and support to children.
A German mother’s honorary Christian was granted to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, the marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, and found on the museum's pages.
The sixth of the traitor-Siren, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko ranked third on the first departure of the Finnjolli Day at the Rio Olympic Games, but remained the top of the whole group on the second departure of the day.
In total, he rose to the eighth after five departures, but the failure of the second departure put him in position on 14th.
The wind Traitor-Siren fought RS:X in the departures of day 17 and three.
In the overall situation, Traitor Siren is the sixth.
In the 470s, Jonah and Niklas Lindgren remained in place at the opening of the day 23.
In the overall situation, the Lindgreni are in position 19.
Jari Sillanpää's Satulinna was recorded in a couple of hours of nights, "I was so hungover"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of Finnish favorite artists for over 20 years.
From the barbeque of the cruiser to the 1995 Tango King, the best selling solo artist in Finland, and the star of the dances and festivals, Sillanpää is still washing and he is currently in a wild lift.
A book written by Mari Koppinen about the life of a favorite singer, Jari Sillanpää, was published today on Thursday.
In the book, Sillanpää tells of his life and career as well as in evil.
The bridge’s career rose to a total rise in winning the Tang King’s crown on the market of the River Seina in 1995.
In the race, Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had written a tango piece on the bridge at the request of a man who was adapted by Kassu Halonen to a slightly different form.
The piece of Satulinna rose to one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says, however, that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Bridgehead sang it on the tape in a terrible hangover and only after a few hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so hungover!
The bridgehead remembers in the book.
You wouldn't think it was a song in a hangar.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, the mark was still good.
I learned that all the time you don't have to ask yourself to be perfect and peak.
Another incident related to one of the most popular songs in the book happened nearly twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his then partner, and the case eventually ended up in the texts of the You earned gold piece, which was published as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered by Sarah Törmäs were not what the Sillanpää would have wanted.
The bridge head had imagined to be making a record that tells a true story about his own life, but the words of the separate song were not true, but it was written on the basis of the news of the 7 days magazine.
In the news of the magazine, Jari and the ex-loved difference were caused by the excessive celebration of Jari and the drinking of alcohol, but Jari said it was a full dome and it was not true.
According to the book, Jari played in a rage to the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and good.
In June, the British also surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
Finally, 52% of voters were in favour and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though the opinion polls of the voting week anticipate the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university signed for the divorce, although a couple of individual researchers were allowed to disagree with the current of their profession.
The theme statement 'It's the economy, stupid', of the former US President Bill Clinton's previous election campaign, flew to ruin in the British Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when their voices didn't belong.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic gypsum
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics collects answers from professionals to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened to because this time voters took a decision on non-economic grounds.
One of the comments of the economists on the loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many people still have the impression that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in work, which is almost constant.
If the immigrant gets a job, it'll be off the right British side.
Many people also have the impression that a fall in the value of currency would be a good thing because it contributes to the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economist, voters did not believe the economic arguments, because the consensus of the economists was not sufficiently expressed.
In particular, they were struck by the balance of the BBC, which gave just as much space to economic scientists who favour only a couple of per cent of the EU's economy as to the overwhelming majority.
The EU's hate press was not interested in telling us what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and other economic power letters and the consequences of the difference are.
These distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly about economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were both heard and understood, they were not conveyed because the economists represent an elite with which voters do not believe that there are common interests.
Although academics such as economicists would have stayed in the EU, the message did not work in small towns and rural areas.
Immigration is also an economy
The overwhelming victory argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
Immigrant takes your job, Immigrants traffickers your hospital, Immigrants take advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Each cafe has foreign employees.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health centre in the waiting room sees immigrants.
How much easier would the British get medical time if they weren't?
Every school has children of immigrants, too.
How much easier would it be for the children of the real Brits to get a place to go to school if they got rid of them?
In every municipality, there are foreigners.
How much more space would the natives have if they were to leave?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond, and if they did, their responses did not get any visibility.
Economists failed to explain that immigrants have increased numbers of jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security thanks to immigrants.
Immigrants - and particularly EU migrants - are net contributors of the British public finances and their consumption generate jobs.
Aberdeen real estate fund booked for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investment is carried out by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
According to her, in Aberdeen, they planned for Brexit in time by drawing up plans A and B.
The plan for B, i.e. the victory of the EU-difference camp, started to be more detailed a few weeks before the vote in case the result was lost.
The concern was that investors would start to withdraw their funds from the market.
As a rule, real estate funds do not have a large amount of liquid resources, but they could now be necessary.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit was on the 23rd day, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, says Vanhanen of Aberdeen's only open daily notation biked from the real estate fund, which was covered by the news.
According to the old man, the normal level would be between 15 and 20 per cent.
The value of the fund at that time was £3.5 billion.
The total value of the company’s funds is around GBP 20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, says Vanhanen of all open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was 10 % or even less.
So the real estate funds reserved for Brexit with very different strategies.
Fund closures
When an EU-difference camp won, Europe went crazy.
However, the less than two weeks that followed the vote on the real estate market were quite calm, says Vanhanen.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was the speech by Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, who estimates that Brexit can be a big risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first real estate fund, Standard Life, frozen its trade.
Together, these have made the situation worse and have brought the financial Times and the BBC to the top of the case.
The situation was immediately compared between 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calm, but private investors were nervous.
Snowball started spinning, and the fund had to close its doors after each other.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash collected, but eventually it had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the old man, they did not actually close down trade but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether it is worth taking the money out in panic.
The message from Aberdeen was that if you're not forced to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would be a loss.
It calmed down the situation, and most of it canceled the report.
Since then, it has been quite smooth, and now the market has been very calm for a few weeks, says Vanhanen.
He points out that, for example, the Manner-European Funds in Aberdeen did not have any similar upheaval.
But there were a lot of interviews.
Unfair attention to real estate funds
According to the old man, the closures of real estate funds trades received disproportionate attention.
The open funds concerned by the closures account for around 4% of British real estate.
Aberdeen’s lock lasted six days and the company sold out less than ten properties from 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned their investors this week that it might hold its fund for half of 2017.
There is currently uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been broken down, but the situation does not seem to be far worse for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British national economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has even brought some of the real estate investors new opportunities, says Vanhanen.
The rate of the pound and the dollar is lowest for 30 years, with a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
The dollar maker can now buy the same property up to 30 percent cheaper.
There's a lot of willing buyers, old man says.
Brexit imported mines on the London real estate market
At two o'clock in the morning, the situation didn't seem so much different.
But at four o'clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, responsible for the real estate investment of the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up to look back at the results of the Brexit vote, there was another situation.
That's the strength of your head, isn't it?
I realized that this is now going to plan B, says Vanhanen in his second home in Helsinki.
He went straight to work.
London City was already alive despite the night.
The TV screens normally set out at the office to be silent supported the news, and usually the loud people were completely silenced to listen when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell us about his divorce.
When the market opened, the end of the screen flashed red.
It was one of those mornings you never thought you'd be alive, says Old Man.
It is not, therefore, that, despite the mess in Aberdee, one of the biggest real estate funds in Britain, finished two real estate transactions on the day after the Brexit vote.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company was well prepared for the alternative, and that's why the situation was kind of calm, says Vanhanen.
Brexit vote started the repair movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
Puna collapsed. Britain's lead went on the exchange.
The market was beginning to anticipate sharp declines in the British real estate market, in particular in London.
As much as 20% of the expenditure in London’s offices was projected in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the noise has subdued, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
True, it does not show up on the old man’s face this week who spent his last summer vacation in Helsinki.
He thinks it is far too early to say much about what Brexit is doing.
So much is still open: how the difference happens and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
First of all, the development of the London real estate market has already taken place.
CBRE’s data on price developments cover about one third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all London's properties fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City's office buildings, the minus accumulated 6.1 per cent, says Vanhanen.
The figures aren't that bad, but they're monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have had fewer figures, says Vanhanen.
All the same cuts hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting, therefore, that Brexit was compared very quickly with Lehman's fall and with the global economic crisis that began in the US real estate market.
The old man thinks that the parable is not quite right, because now it is a domestic crisis in Britain.
The atmosphere is different, too.
The real estate market has now seen, not panic sales like that time, but the willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
There's also a standard financial guarantee.
In any event, the correction movement could have been in front of
In fact, it's not a miracle to him that the price adjustment movement could have been in front of him without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen, property prices in London and other worlds have been too high for years.
We have said for two years that City, especially the offices, is overpriced, says Vanhanen.
So the fall started really high.
London's prices have written upwards for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown strongly, so has London's population.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last class of property that is globalising, says Vanhanen.
New players have become markets in the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate sites abroad.
London, known as the city, is an easy destination.
In addition, prices have been fed by low interest rates, which, for example, means that pension companies have been forced to look for profits from new targets.
This loan has been readily available - although the debt margin has been used by Vanhase now clearly less than during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
Disperse, disperse
In London, the price rise has stabilised last summer, says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen, too, began to ease his ownership in London, and last year he was a net seller.
There was some kind of turning to be expected, and now it's here.
What's going on?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says Vanhanen.
He's not afraid to judge what's coming, but he says that there's hardly any way to get up.
The atmosphere indicates that there is a downward or even way forward.
The old man has already seen several movements up and down, as he has been in the real estate since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who thinks they can survive the pits at work.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you will be in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in one market, it's too much for the victim.
If you've dissipated, the risks are also decentralised, says Vanhanen.
S-Group is starting to register purchase data more closely
Soon the S Group will know what you are eating, as today the trading group reported that it is beginning to collect more detailed information on its customers' purchases.
After the final amount of the receipt has been collected so far, the group will start picking it up at the beginning of May for the products purchased.
The S-Group follows Kesko here, because data on goods purchased with a plus card have been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to K-Plus Oy's CEO, Ismo Riitala, the feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
The product-specific data shall be collected with the consent of the customer and used with the consent of the customer for marketing purposes.
The most effective channel is email.
A rather rare customer has banned the use of product information, says Riitala to the economy.
According to him, Kesko is not going to react to Group S's registration change.
Kesko is already classifying her regular client according to merely buying food in ten groups.
The classification shall be updated monthly.
Customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money they spend on them.
The information is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data are collected only from the K-Group's own chains.
Co-operating partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a parent client program and this is not planned for this period.
The Finnish Close Shop has its own "One-Bonus" customer program, which can be associated with in Valtavatalos, Siwok and Euromarkets.
At the moment we do not collect product or product group-level information, we stick to the final amount of the receipt.
So we know which store the purchases were made, and that day, and the final amount of the customer's receipt.
We have not gone to that level as the K-Group or the S-Group, says the commercial leader Anu Ora.
According to him, the regular client programme will be reformed in the future, but the close trade will tell you about it later.
However, Ora does not promise that the product information will be registered.
First try
The customer and customer register of SOK has so far been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal and address information, basic information has included: occupation, education, housing, years of birth of children and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role have also been registered.
The purchase date and time, the place, the final amount of purchases and the method of payment have been saved from the S-Education Card Purchase.
In addition, data from S-bonus partners have been obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, purchase data at product level will be deposited in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
On the other hand, the S-markets, Prismos, Kodin Terroi and ABC chains currently record the information at product group level.
For a long time, customers have been hoping to focus more on marketing, says Marjana Saarikoski, the customer owner and partner manager of SOK.
The S-Group says they're going to inform their clients about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the information is stored in the bags, whether you want it or not.
The willing person can check the stored data from the S-Group's website.
For example, the cashiers do not have access to the information, stressing Saarikoski.
Video: Heila puppy is Tulli's latest dog reinforcement - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The black labrador donor pups the five similar countries with a rowed box at Helsinki Airport.
It won't take long for it to sit firmly next to the middle box.
The customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his dog Heila to play it with his favorite toy.
In the box next to which Heila sat, there was a jar of shells that smelled like powder gas.
Soap gas is the first smell that Heila and I have been practicing, says Suntio, the owner of Heila's dog.
Security situation and access to online commerce
Heila is the first dog specializing in the search for Tulli weapons and explosives and it will be located at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also take Heila and Sunto to other border crossing points and ports, if necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila's main job because the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused action in Customs, and the controls have been strengthened after the attacks, says Mikko Grönberg, the Oversight Officer of Customs.
The second entry to the training of a dog with weapons and explosives Customs is mailing through Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the increased internet trade, up to 40 million mail mails are delivered each year through the airport, which may include weapons and explosives ordered abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made online shops at Helsinki Airport, including baggage and air cargo for passenger machinery, approximately 300 weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives and their precursors.
Heila will work across Helsinki Airport.
It will examine checked baggage and mail.
In ports, it will be of great benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more research, says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of Heila, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is hoping for the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
The education of the Heila puppy is coordinated by the Tull dog school in Kirkkonumme.
The Suntio also attends training with Heila with police and defence experts.
The police have strong experience of dog training and defence expertise in explosives.
Customs will decide together with other authorities what smells Heila will be taught to identify.
Heila is always trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues in Helsinki Airport include six drug dogs, and the money and the drug dog Massi.
Labrador retriever Heila has been chosen from the 10 puppies' pups.
The selection criteria for the dog to be selected at the airport include a hole in the hunt, as well as calmness, as the dog is involved in weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion's home, is a close associate of the customs inspector, but also a member of the family.
Nothing without Heila gets home, Suntio laughs.
The subtle orders go to Heila from a single laak.
The cameraman of the Evening-Sanome loses the camera mike cover to the fast dog, but Heila returns the soft cover immediately from the "crap" command.
Hard competition from working dogs
Heila's initial education will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, then in October, which assesses whether training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heilan can be seen in work in Helsinki Airport next year, if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to petal the work vests on top of the dog, reminds Suntio.
The cost of one working dog is around EUR 60000-70000 per year for customs purposes.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, even ten, after which they retire to the care of their owners.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active parts last only 10 minutes to a few hours.
The owner of working dogs is a tough competition in Tull.
Heila was owned by about 20-30 Customs employees.
Luck hit Suntio, who has never had a work dog before, but has years of experience in dogs and control tasks in Customs.
The Ministate got their first Olympic medal - People get a day off
The Olympics in Fiji, with less than a million inhabitants, are valued in the country so high that the government has appointed August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the country's broadcasting company, the Fijian government confirmed the state of the championship.
The day off will be held the day after the team return.
There are also festiveities for the heroic team in his country.
Fiji's Rugby team is celebrating the championship.
The Guardian says that the country was following the finals in the capital city of Suval, where the stadium had been erected with a screen.
Normally, only the native Fijians are interested in Rugby, but this game combined our multicultural community.
Even the Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them encourage, said Fiji Times reporter to Maiikele Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish buyer passed out after a wild performance
In his last attempt, the pusher, Milo Tokola, succeeded from 175 kilos after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During or immediately after criminal liftings, he has passed out many times.
Nobody's really been able to tell me why.
In Rio, Tokola gained 175 kilos and 145 kilos of push.
His joint outcome was 320 kilos.
Tokola tried to get her unemployed at the last 175 pounds, as did the other one.
On the third attempt, the weights rose as a result of wild screaming.
The crown was shaking under the weights until the jury accepted the raise.
The pleasure of the Finnish buyer was that he had suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired the Estonian winner Prosa - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Society, which plays in the Men's Football League, has concluded a sustainable agreement with Estonian winner Albert Prosa.
We are looking for our team's top player, who has power and has a small threshold for coming to Finland and Rovaniemi.
We went through more than ten players with agents from around the world.
Little silence from the crowd began to resign as a good alternative Prosa, coach Juha Malinen of the RoPS, reported in the release.
Prosa, 25, arriving in RoPS from the Talentan Flora, where she scored a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played in the Estonian country team.
The Prosan is due to be with RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemins will meet the ruling Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new attacker when last season secular king Alexander Kokko moved to Australia.
The proud Modern Family star repositions: the teen star shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who became known as Alex Dunphyna as the modern family comedy, yet again blows up by presenting his proud body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in minishorts that don't leave much to imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also his ass.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by making his style and behaviour much more courageous.
The star has posed in his pictures published in social media in very few clothes and took numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen to dress in very poor clothes.
Winter, on the threshold of adulthood, has recently published several images of himself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can look at it here.
Earlier this summer Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his image so radically.
In this case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter had a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He's been on TV almost all his life and grew up in the Kardashians' era.
He has learned that the more it appears to reveal the surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood, Palmer tells Fox News and adds that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has been inflamed by some of his long - term fans with their imagogy.
It is not hard to guess where she will be in ten years, when the bottom line is already so hard, says one woman in Winter's Instagram.
Some of the female fans, on the other hand, defend an actor and urge him not to give a damn about criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what the others say.
You're an inspiration to a lot of women, a young woman glows.
Japanese prefers to visit Finland - tourists are attracted to a revant: The autumn is possible to see the accursed storm aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to begin their return trips from the early fall, Visit Finland explains in the newsletter.
Inari and Levi are the main targets of Japanese return tourism.
The northern lights are the driving cards of our winter travel, and they are closely connected to the winter of the heart and the snowy landscapes.
In Lapland's winter, the resonators have very much to demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
It is rare to know that the revant season begins early in the autumn and continues far into spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called Mirror Aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the display two times random, says Anne Lind, marketing manager.
Visit Finland's main target group is wealthy 25-35-year-olds, Japanese women living in the city who dream about tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, among other things.
According to a survey carried out by Aalto University and researchers from Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive image among Japanese people compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need clearer unique attractions of Finland, and this revant has enormous potential.
Nights spent by Japanese tourists have grown considerably more in Finland than the other Nordic countries.
Last year they spent more than double as many nights in Finland as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are of interest to Finnish tourism as a target group because they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese used 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain will be satisfied with Rugby silver as Fidi leads the master class in gold
The impressive progress in the Rugby tournament in Great Britain collapsed to the final challenge of Fiji in the Thursday night final, when the team suffered 43-7 crushes at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fidzi held a master's class on handling, chewing, evasives, support, running lines, and smooth power when he won the gold - their first Olympic medal.
The loss was accompanied by a reasonable comfort from the silver medallion - the third of Britain's day - and they were proud of their hard work at the Olympics' Rugby start-up tournament, in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The hard 7-5 victory of the semifinal played earlier that day from South Africa could trouble them in the final.
But despite this, Fidi would have won a 15-person high-end team in this condition.
Perhaps Britain can - but probably not - be comforted by the fact that at least one Brits have a gold medal in their necks tomorrow: Fid's head coach is Ben Ryan, former head of Wimbledon, England.
It's been quite a trip to Great Britain.
Eight years ago, when they were trained by Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide tournament.
This is where they lost only one.
This sauna hurts, but it's a shocking development.
Fidi began a great fight against British attacks for fun.
To Captain Tom Mitchell, with his teams, this was like they were running mobile buses, and world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived in the corner to the finish area.
When the clock was in four minutes, Jerry Tuwai's second touchdown on the right side led to a goal kick.
12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant takatus stopped the male mountain Leone Nakarawa from making the third goal, but it was only slow for Fid.
At seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored in the right corner, and the UK had a 17-0 loss.
Nakarawa once again scored a new start, and the clock still had more than a minute left...the first half of the time.
After that Vatemo Ravouou rushed through the United Kingdom’s discovery of attacks and rushed to the line to make a goal.
After the paint kick, the situation with the break was 29-0.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while Britain was just learning the game.
And that's the way it really is.
The United Kingdom made a gross change on the break that blocked the Fid dam...for a total of four minutes, which was good compared to the first half of the time, until Josua Tuisova scored the goal after Fid's impressive pitching game.
Dan Norton caught a goal in Britain when he made touchdown in the left corner and narrowed the situation to 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the islanders of the South Sea, whose supporters sang, waving flags and dancing in the audiences.
It was hard not to admire Fid's joyful approach.
At the last minute's finish, Mata Viliame had a peel in Fid's cake, which didn't need a peel.
They whistled, the Fidish hugged, and the United Kingdom fell to the grass, totally hit.
Earlier that day, Fidi had hit Japan in the semifinal of 20-5, and Britain won South Africa in a tight semifinal where both scored one goal - the British goal kick solved the game.
Kyle Brown took South Africa's lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the target area with a dazzling footwork and scored it under the goals in the second half of the time.
It's a great late fight from Marcus Watson, the British 15-side rugby team from Anthony's brother, to ensure victory and finally the silver medal.
The coach's fight against cancer led Helen Glober and Heather Stanning to a rowing victory.
There will be no more emotional gold in these races, and that really means something.
On the first bet of the last, 220 hard bikings towards history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in Estacio da Lagoa from their golden moments.
Even though they rowed alone, there were three voices on the boat, and Coach Robin Williams' echo was there all the time, when the twins were playing in their second consecutive Olympics in the Women's Couple Competition, the first women in the history books of British sports that reached such a goal.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance undefeated, which is record.
This, which we see, is not entirely about the nature of the victory.
There are a group of helpful couples behind each rowing gold who gradually promote those things that matter, and not one pair of hands was as essential as a coach who, 30 months ago, did not know if he would live to this day.
As he said, the situation was close.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that could be cut, and they did the surgery.
If they don't operate, it'll spread everywhere.
It could have been pretty bad.
It changes your way of thinking.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The tripartite was fortunate that at the beginning of 2014 his treatment could be initiated outside the season, in which case they caused as little disturbance as possible - if this expression can ever be used in situations such as this.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the department 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said that a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
The rowing itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the first couple of thoughts was Williams, who had had been nervous in the morning, and he had talked a little more than usual, trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, an experienced captain of a royal artillery in Afghanistan, said: "I have been a tunnel union this week, which may be a little overreacted, but this means so much to me."
It just stresses how important this is to me, how much I and Helen, and Robin too, have worked.
It's been three years with Helen and Robin.
If it wasn't for Robin, we wouldn't be doing anything, so he's gonna have a big thank you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost competition in five years.
A couple of them put a rough rhythm that their competitors couldn't reach.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams in New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in stock.
We were very close in a moment.
Helen screamed "a stop in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we did not try to do anything special.
We didn't look for fireworks today, we were just trying to win a good row and a race, and that's what we did.
A couple of years before they decide on their future.
Glover's gonna be attending the wedding next month when he's getting married to a TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this would be my last race.
It would have put too much pressure on him.
After London, it took about six months to realize that I was the Olympic champion.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
This is where it took about four minutes.
This feels so much better," he said.
Iceland will change the government of the Panaman leaks
Iceland will hold an early parliamentary election in October, which will already be called for by the protestors in Panama's data leaks in the spring.
The so-called Panaman papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians had circumvented taxes by means of tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but it was not enough for protestors.
His successor Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson promised to hold a new parliamentary election in the autumn.
The election day has now been decided on 29 October.
Analysts indicate that it is difficult to predict how much the public's last spring rage affects the election result of the autumn.
In the Presidential elections in June, the criticism of the authorities was clearly visible, and Gudni Johnson was elected President from outside the policy.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed to be the founder of Obama Isis.
The U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump withdrew his latest coup.
He said that he was sarcastic in claiming that the sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organisation Isis and the candidate for democracy, Hillary Clinton, involved in the establishment of the organisation.
The Democratic Party was angry with the speeches and asked Trump for forgiveness.
As commander of the Army, we should never let anyone who can sink down like that, Clinton, into your suite.
In southern France, the Mayor of Cannes has banned the use of burkini swimwear, which is preferred by Muslims, says, among other things, the British magazine Guardian.
The decision, signed by Mayor David Lisnard, states that going to the beaches and swimming areas is prohibited for all who do not have a good manner and a bathing suit that respects secularism.
The decision also states that swimwear, which largely express religious ties, can increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into the crowd celebrating the French National Day.
At the end of July, two extremities connected to Isis attacked the church in northern France and killed an 80-year-old priest.
The quality of the bathing waters in the Oulu area passed through the sieve - the Blue Sage in the Lake of Pyykös
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only Bluefinch has been observed on the shore of Lake Pyykösjärvi.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environmental Action took water samples from nine EU coasts and 30 other public bathing areas in the Oulu region.
With the exception of the coast of Meriniemi, the concentrations of all E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in bathing waters in bathing areas were below the operational limits laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and enterococ concentrations of the seaside bathing area were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the operational limits.
The blue sage found on the shore of the fishing lake does not yet make the water swimming-free, but under favourable conditions, the situation can quickly change into a blue-shoeed flower, making the surface blue green with a lush mass of rest.
The environmental action will follow the situation through increased inspections.
In the event of a change in the Bluefinch, the reporting table of the bathing area shall also be notified separately.

MTK’s Hakkarainen Forest Gift Reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside
The reduction in forest gifts is one of the tax changes in the Ministry of Finance's proposal for next year's budget.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax reduction to be granted on the basis of the gift tax on the generational change of forest holdings.
In the proposal of the Ministry of Finance, the reduction of forest gifts has four objectives: to promote the generational changes in forest holdings, to stimulate the age structure of forest owners, to increase forest size and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
A forest owner would reduce the net profit of forestry.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote the generational exchange of forest holdings is good, commenting on the Forest Director Juha Hakkarainen’s Central Association of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, the Hakkainen finds a critical change in the proposal.
The reduction in forest gifts is presented as a task for the forest owner’s pure capital income.
It is a capital income that has been deducted from all other deductions.
In the view of the MTK and Hakkarainen, the effectiveness of the tax reduction would be greater if the reduction could be made directly from the sales result of the wood.
The proposal by the VM leaves it to reduce the net income of forestry by preventing the loss of the capital income of forestry, which would be deducted from other taxation.
Such a person would benefit from the tax even if the wood was not sold.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner can't figure it out, says Hakkarainen.
In addition, the model applies only to a small proportion of forest owners.
The tax reduction limit linked to forest income is EUR 40 000.
It's been pulled too high for Hakkarainen.
As such, he said that 82 percent of Finnish forest owners were cut off from the circle.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of forest owners, he says.
The VM considers that the border guarantees the objective of farming.
In forest policy, the reduction of forest gifts has been taken by Hakkarainen for decades.
It is driven by the ageing of forest owners.
According to the MSK, the average age of forest owners is currently more than 60 years and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful rave surprised the motorists at Himanga... two cars went down into a ditch and ran into each other.
A special chase happened on Friday morning in Himanga, Kalajoki.
According to the rescue department, two consecutively upgraded cars went into a ditch, after which the behind came across the one who was running after them.
According to the chief firefighter Harri Pyyht, the fall into a ditch is suspected to have been caused by a severe rave.
There were two people in the back of the car that were both transported to the hospital for treatment.
There's no more accurate information on their injuries.
The driver of the above-mentioned car was not injured.
The accident occurred on highway 8 from Himanga to Kalajoki for a few miles.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to develop cancer treatments more effectively.
The findings made by academic professor Johanna Ivaska’s study group show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the malignancy of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to ivaska, the growth of cancer was prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue around the cancer to the normal soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer medications may be improved by focusing on the interaction between the cancer cells and the surrounding tissue.
The results have been published on 4 August in the highly respected Nature Communications in the field of cell biology.
The mute family death tree continues in court, the prosecution also demands a murder sentence for the other unsub.
The framework for the family death of a muhos continues in the court for both convicted.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for the death of a family home in Muhos.
One received eight years of murder and gross robbery, including as a young person, for example.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for the murder and gross robbery committed as a young person.
The person convicted of killing was also convicted of a serious endangerment of road safety as a young person and of the right to drive a vehicle as a young person.
The judgment of the district court was appealed to by the prosecutor, the prosecutors and the man who received a more severe sentence.
The D.A. claims a lower penalty to punish a man for murder as a young person for 12 years in prison.
At the time of the act, they were fully understood.
According to the Circumstances, 17-year-old youths killed a man who worked as the director of the child protection unit of the school home in July last year.
The 17-year-old who was sentenced to murder attacked the pilot on the couch of the living room.
The director had come out of the grip and put a young man in his room, when one of the young people hit him with a vacuum tube.
Among other things, the director was strangled, hit and kicked in the head.
According to a state of mind study, both condemned at the time of action were fully understood.
According to the law, young people had planned to escape from the family home at least from the previous day.
Ice shark is the longest vertebrate in the world, growing only at 156 years of age
The world's longest living vertebrate has been confirmed by an ice shark, says research published in Science magazine.
In the north of the Atlantic, like an ice shark floating around Greenland, or a holler can live up to 400 years of age.
A female is only growing when she's 156 years old.
The fact that it only grows a centimeters a year adds to the ice age.
Only one species of bivalve molluscs is known to live longer than the ice sharks.
Researchers discovered the age with a radio-carbon drive.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
On the basis of these, scientists were able to assess the age of sharks.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years, though, in the direction of a throw or another can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as an economic visa - People's News
The United States of Donald Trump does not need to change the world.
Even a third of the State's total tax revenue would be lost if the change to corporate tax driven by Donald Trump was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular with tax relief that benefits the richest.
Trump described his tax programme as revolutionary when he introduced it on Monday in Detroit.
Corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
Without collecting it, there would be a huge amount of $1,000 billion a year.
The top tax rate is now 39.6, after the discount proposed by Trump 33.
They'd give up the inheritance tax completely.
Trump accused the state of over-regulation and bankruptcy of small businesses.
The environmental standards decided on by the emergency must be renewed and the energy regulation must be removed.
The health reform of Barack Obama needs to be re-examined.
The administration must be called 'experts instead of bureaucrats'.
According to Trump, a 'harmful' trade policy is the main cause of the problems in the United States.
We'd be getting rid of our free trade agreements.
45% of imports from China and 35% of Mexico would be reduced.
We'll offer you a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our creed, Trump declared.
The United States of America, Donald Trump, does not need to change the world:
American cars will drive in the streets, American aircraft will unite cities, American ships to control the sea, American steel to lift new skyscrapers all over the country.
By contrast, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by the assistants, even though well - organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
The economists - including those close to the Republicans - see Trump's program taking the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton released its own program early on Friday Finnish time.
Attack from the Past - People's News
The sea is fatal, but the real wave of attack strikes in the middle of the street of Madrid - an account with the past can begin.
That summed up Pedro Almodóvar's novelty story.
Almodovar's previous guidance The Travel Lovers (2013) were a little fun and a raging satirical comedy, preceded by the Skin where I live (2011) at the top of my Spanish career.
In parallel, Julieta (2016) is somewhere between those two works.
It's a cohesive inner love, relationship and family drama centred on the mother-daughter relationship.
It's a simple story, and we'll see a lot of things as a long guarantee.
Life seems to be a model for the middle-aged nominal person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the subsequent references to random encounters, a new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) may be amazed to the end of the film.
In the form of a guarantee and a long letter, Julieta once became an adult to her daughter.
He begins from the time before the birth of his daughter, from the moments when he met this coming father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adrina Ugarte, who is a young teacher in Julieta, is the second main woman, and she is a TV friend of the series "Smämmelte" (2013-2014).
Julieta's ageing has been dealt with in a way that can be considered as a poo, but I would say that it's a bit strange and literally one-off.
For Almodóvar films, there is often a fair distance to such a characteristic of the slopingness of the humor in Julieta.
It is an equally played, controlled, place in some places with good music and quite sad movie, which has elements for elegia.
On the other hand, the Spanish director has a typical visual appearance and begins to inject a little quietly into the eye as more of a pure form than a functional dramatic means of action.
People in the film are subjected to illness, death or otherwise only sudden loss, but the surface remains equally Korean.
This applies in particular to clothing: in the case of a nominal person, you change from scene to scene, and the same applies to visible ears.
Almodovvar is precise in these matters, but the main issue is that the seizures of the current scene are not particularly improving.
Mechanically, when the impression is repeated, it is extraordinarily and slightly non-spiritual.
Almodóvar has written the manuscript on the basis of three novels of the Canadian Alice Munro, awarded at Nobel 2013.
Novellit is published in Karkulainen: Reports.
Almodóvar has invested in the dialogue, resulting in a bit of rectified literary filmmaking.
The materials would have been emotionally incredibly steeper than the drama, so much big things, especially the pale guilt, the theme of the movie.
Control and manuscript: Pedro Almodvar.
Based on three novels from Alice Munro.
Mainly Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The first night of the film is 12.8.
Government is trying to run the election game - People's News
No new cuts will be made, the ministers will say so, so that the basic Finns do not collapse altogether.
However, the operations decided in the spring will be carried out at the top of the market.
There will be no new surgery.
The already decided savings of four billion will be sufficient.
This is how Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Minister of Finance Petter Orpo (cf.).
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the proposal by the VM, since the social security cuts were already decided in the spring frame.
Children's pensions, national pensions, basic unemployment security and nearly all other benefits linked to the national pension index are cut by 0.85%.
The duration of unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 to 400 days.
Training operations continue.
The municipals are haunted
Why are ministers so hard to stress that there will be no further cuts on these?
Because next year is the election year.
The municipalities will be held in April and they will be the main heat meter of the parliamentary term, not the gallupes.
It has been seen before that a municipal income which takes the different directions of the government parties is ruining the government's atmosphere for a long time.
However, Gallup reports that basic Finns from the Government Party are expected to lose their lives, although the result of its previous elections was modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, based Finns received 752 new delegates, a large part of whom will be realised next spring at the price of influence in the right-wing government.
The lifeline of the three large parties’ government is based on the survival of the basic Finns.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those voting for the party have had enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's visits have also come to the surface.
There will be no further cuts, firstly, the fact that next year they will be made harshly and, secondly, they will try to soften the expected attack on the basic Finns.
Majors in 2018?
In a year's time, everything will probably be different if Sipila's government is still standing.
The government has set itself the goal of depreciating debt in this parliamentary term, but next year, the Petteri Orpo's draft budget will be EUR 5.9 billion, more than this year.
After the municipal councils, the government has two options.
The first is to put your hands up in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to follow its own programme: debt is not skilled or even slowed down.
The other one is to hold on to the program.
It means newer cuts on former ones in the 2017 budget deficit.
The budget would at least be spent close to balance during 2018, and then in the spring the Parliamentary elections will receive what will happen.
indebtedness with these measures will not be affected
It is quite clear that the current measures do not have the potential to indebtedness, even though Juha Sipilä is trying to perpetuate a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by Secretary of State Martti Hetemäen at the information session of the budget prove it irrefutably:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be overoptimal, i.e. no veto aid from the international economy.
Since the collapse in 2008, Finland's national economy has not risen much further than the temporary recovery policy in the early 2010s.
In this decade, unemployment has increased by 35%, extending from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion more per year than in 2008.
In the curves presented by seven, government debt, which exceeded the 60 % threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% in the middle of the next decade.
What's responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt relief from the Left Union was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, unemployment will cost some EUR 6 billion, which will in practice be covered by a completely new debt.
This is the view of the centre, the assembly and the basic Finns of what is responsible.
Question: A lot of tasks are to be left to the municipalities
Three out of four consider that the organisation of day care, youth work and exercise of children is the responsibility of the municipality, as shown in the study of KKS - Kunnallisala’s Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people are also responsible for libraries, culture, civil education, building supervision, upper secondary school education and waste management.
In turn, the responsibility of the county is more clearly sought for regional development, special medical care, vocational training, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for disabled people.
None of the tasks entrusted to the municipalities are intended to be transferred to the State.
A minor drink ran after the chase and ended up running the police.
A 16-year-old motorcyclist in Joensuu drove a police patrol out of Joensuu on Friday night at half a.m.
The police patrol tried to stop the motorbike without lights, but the young man left to drive the police away at fair speed.
The back road continued on the Sokajanranna road, from which to Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle got out of the road.
After this, the young man ran away, but the faster the police ran into the fugitive.
The blow test for the driver showed 0.75 millimeters.
He also had no driver's license to drive a motorcycle.
The case is being examined, inter alia, as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck in the stone truck fell into a ditch.
The truck in the stone truck fell into a ditch in Lake Knevijärvi on Thursday night at 21.15 p.m.
The truck had run out of the road in the bending corner to the left and fell on its side of the well.
The rescue unit raised the injured driver through the door above the fallen truck together with the rescue helicopter staff and the first carers.
It was the car owner's responsibility to lift it.
In the fallen truck, hydraulic oil was poured into the road by a rescue plant that sucked into the peat.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared this afternoon in the Air River.
A 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in Lahtinkyla, Lahdenkyla, South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for a woman about five feet [ 165 cm] long, thin, and kind, with white hair below her jaw.
Observations and clues on missing movements are requested to call the Ostrobothnia Status Center's hotline number 0295440513.
The elements of the major accident in the air - see the gallery on the destruction of Parafest
The flooding current from the parafest festival tents caused massive damage.
Arto Pippuri, Chairman of the Joensuu Paraphesy, estimates that the festival will be able to reach its feet economically, and the event will be held next year.
The last performer of the Parafest, Kalle Salonen, appeared at the end of Friday night on the market.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with presentations at the theatre venues starting at 13.00.
The Art Centre in Ahjo is a Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The programme will be organised as planned.
The discharge flow occurs in the thunder cloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a fall in air flow.
The changes in the condition of the water in the thunder cloud bind heat, and thus the falling air cools and speeds up toward the earth.
It is reported from the Department of Meteorological Sciences that there are several flooding flows in Finland during the summer.
It's hard to predict the course of the crash currents.
The crash flow hit the Joensuu Art Museum, which was the scene of Parafest, in the backyard on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents went down, there were about 200 people in the tents.
In an accident, four persons were mildly hurt.
There was one child in the group who was slightly injured to follow-up treatment.
Air pollution aging in London
According to the study, the skin of the lontos will grow older than usual.
The cause of skin ageing is air pollution.
The English survey is described in the Evening Standard.
The British skin treatment company Caci analyzes London without the most toxic particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that many pensioners in London have two and a half years older skin than those living in rural areas.
The skin - ageing particles are a very fine dust pollution that comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to Evening Standard, die of nearly 9,500 lontos every year.
Studies have shown that particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
The Cac study found that early ageing is a risk, especially for those in London who walk their way to work near congested streets.
People in London can try to protect themselves from air pollution by, for example, various masks, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
Tractor brakes failed the man standing in front of you.
He had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and went in front of it, the brakes failed and the tractor poured over the man.
The man did not fall under it, but the tractor was able to push the man enough to be transported to the central hospital as seriously injured in further investigations.
The tractor didn't have time to flow any further, as it ran into the stones in front of it.
The Riding With New Power for the coming Season
The League-Riento Riverman, who plays in the volleyball Championship, leaves a series that starts in October from a better starting point than a man-to-man memory.
The team's been together for three weeks.
The common tune is sure to be found better than in previous periods, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
Jani Sääsä, who continues to be the head coach of the joy, calls the new team entrepreneurial and united.
Out of the three foreigns, Fred Musoni will begin his second term in Rienna.
The new face is 23 years old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who's been on Rwanda's national team, is a 205-inch hacker.
Garchet is respectively a passar, and the Brazilian has a size of 198 cents.
To the U.S. national team through Josban, Kataja and River Sons
Anne Juppinen has played in almost all the gym band's World Cup since 2003.
Now Tampere is already the sixth race, only 2013 was missed after Canada had been better off in North America.
I was working in Turku and playing with the women there when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was about to set up a salibandy country team.
I was interested, and here we are, Juprine, 48, says.
He was born in 1967 near New York City of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was a year old.
In 1987, Juppinen entered the University of Joensuu to study data processing.
When I came to Joensuu, such a species was not yet played on the MS level as a salibandy.
It was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later hockey in the River Boys in the SM series, Juppine remembers.
With the university playing the salibandy SM series between 1991 and 1992, the following three went into Josba.
Besides playing, he trained the company's A-girls for the championship.
The women's SM serial career peaked in 1995.
All in all, Juppinen played in the women's SM series through 10, and the balance came up in 169 matches 51+34=85.
The latest MS period is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Vänänen were appointed to the national team
The Joensuu Salibandy Society Josban raised Perttu Puska and the Enola based Tatu Vänänen were elected to the Finnish Country Team, which will play in the Czech Brnon EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
In Helsinki, Perttu Puska, an attacking 25-year-old, has played this game before six men's field matches, where he has accumulated total power points 9+4=13.
The 32-year-old defenseman of the Swiss Wiler-Ersigen Tatu Vänänen has recovered from the passenger rug and is part of the country team's standard equipment with 117 ground fighting experiences.
The country team was also named Mika Kohonen, the co-op player of the Seinajoki Gamesmen, who was last seen in the Finnish shirt last time in the World Cup last December.
The head coach of the Salibandy County Team is Petri Kettunen, a Conthio Bay.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes to Kouvola - SM gold missing in the award box
Essi Hasu is about to end up as a beach volley player at least temporarily after the current season.
Beach Volley Finland's championships will be decided on the weekend in Kouvola Sports Park.
During three days, medals will be played in the series of adults and young people.
In cooperation with Kouvola Ballooners and the Finnish Balloon Association, the SM finals will be eligible for the six best pairs of each series of rankings.
The local color in the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, who has been a member of the Finnish beach volley peaks for several years.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many as possible get to the audience this weekend.
I'm sure there's gonna be a great arena for the pessis stadium.
I haven't played in the adult series very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals at home angles, Hasu Tunnel.
The Kouvola area lit Hasu's spark on sport and gave good lunches to a fine hobby.
There's a lot of memories of being a child.
I started the volleyball at the age of nine in Elimäe's NMKY E-girls.
The top part is too big a sloth in the mind, the knee caps in the ankles, and the great ass lips and choreographers after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small area, the sports club was a close community in which everyone knew each other.
The group's life together created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were very active. The father of a teammate trained us, and our mother was the chairman of the company for a long time.
Essi Hasule bach volley was already a natural choice of species to counterweight the indoor volleyball.
By the 1990s, there has been a bit of music playing on the waterfront.
Action has always been active.
I also went to the junior SM tour myself thinking that one day I would be there to play.
Now, this dream comes true when Hasu plays in the weekend together with Anniina Parkkise, a pit-mountain in the SM finals.
After Riikka Lehtosen and Taru Lahti, the second-ranked double goal is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We're still missing the SM gold in the award box, Hasu throws in a mysterious way.
The presence of a weekend in Kouvola may be the last time that Hasu has ever been known to the public.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await civil work.
Yes, the international career is over after the Raceallion tournament.
Otherwise the toes will be placed on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.

Solomon’s Koli bravely left for a farmer
Agriculture as an entrepreneur means risk-taking, sweat and energy efficiency.
A young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became an farmer because he believes in a positive future in the countryside.
It was about two years ago that Koli and his little brother, Valteri Kol, began working as a successor to their home.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Starting up as a rural entrepreneur meant taking on debt and increasing the volume so that bread could come into hand from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always been happy to be on the farm, and now that I've started as an entrepreneur, I've put everything in the game.
If something starts, I think it needs to be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we left to build a driveway, and at first the bank was not excited about it.
However, I took a truly courageous part in the project, and I have been fully involved in it, says Solomon Koli and adds that he would not have acted if he had no faith in the production of pure Finnish food and in the fact that everything is going to turn to good.
The goal of Solomon Kol, who grows meat cars, is to invest even more in his own navel.
The work has produced results because Solomon Koli has been chosen among the top ten in the competition of the young food producer of the Rural Future.
He's currently competing for a possible victory.
He can vote on the website of the magazine until 21.8.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest reading for years (after June 2012) and the first reading above zero after October of last year, when a positive 0.2% was reported.
The average annual inflation measured using the cost-of-life index was -0.8% in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The life cost index of July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. the monthly inflation rate was 1.0%.
From the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015), inflation has been -0.2% and annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, the price of the following consumer goods showed an increase: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), mixed goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household and routine care (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and training.
Snapchat's "anime" effect is rated as Asian caricature
Snapchat says the anime has been an inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it's racist.
With the help of its Lens Tool, Snapchat enables some 150 million daily users to edit reality and play with identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into an pineapple, a dog, or a character that fits the painting of Roy Lichtenstein.
Lens are simple, face-reversible tools that produce more than 30 million improved self - control per day.
All false steps quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat lenses have previously been criticised for the fact that the application advertises a blackface or "black face" mask or prefers to whiten skin color as a beauty design.
So when Snapchat advertised to some users this week a lens that gave them the gloomy eyes, the gloomy teeth and the gloomy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people, or yellowface.
And they were wondering if these repeated failings could be a sign of the company’s greater problem of diversity.
News and evil spread on a wide Wednesday along with the reports from The Vergen and Motherboard, the day later Snapchat said that he had ceased the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant to honor anime characters, not the caricature of Asians.
But the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes of activity for observers who experienced racism.
Others were passionately denying anime comparison.
Grace Sparapan, a Korean-American art student, who was widely distributed from the Twite photos, said in his e-mail that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable".
He added that "it is difficult to argue against a comparison that is adjacent to the gross Asian caricature and filter effects".
It shows that the filter is not only a yellow mask, but a yellow mask taken to extreme disadvantages.
Snapchat is not the only company that exceeds these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be attached to endless struggles about diversity and inclusion, corporate meeting rooms in Hollywood and equipment that we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat’s vast audience, racially older, may mean that they are even more likely to expect understanding attitude.
The 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in the interview on Thursday that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates an offensive image for the user, "it's much harder for these guys to be unnoticed than before".
On Thursday, Zhu, Product Manager and Engineer working for Medium, decided to remove his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his letter to the Medium and phone interview, he said that he believed that racial disputes reflect the lack of diversity of Snapchat's pay practices.
Zhu mainly criticized the company's white men's management and ended his writing with Hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#FromSnapchat)
"They either do not have a diverse representation of different colours of skin in their personnel, which is why they are able to make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have representatives of different colours at work, but they are not in positions where they feel safe or could speak straight."
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely failed to reply to.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff, noting its status as a private enterprise.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial status of its staff, but according to the representative, some time ago, the company hired a recruiter to concentrate on the under-represented populations and to carry forward internal integration efforts.
Zhu, for his part, said that he would keep his Snapchat account closed, adding: "Is it true that they need more users like us to say that this is not okay?"
According to the Congress panel, military officials were falsifying Isis intelligence.
In a report published on Thursday, the Congress Panel said that intelligence reports from the headquarters of the US military military division were more optimistic about the war on Isis in Iraq and Syria than was justified by the events on the ground.
The Interim Report of the Working Party set up by the Republican Chairman of the Defence Forces Committee of the Chamber of Representatives, the Intelligence Committee and the Sub-Committee on Defence Appropriations found "wide dissatisfaction" among the intelligence analysts at the headquarters who said that the superiors failed to assess their efforts to win Isis.
The headquarters, known as Centcoma, is a staff of the armed military mission in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. armed operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence outputs typically accepted by higher-value Centcom leaders gave a more positive picture of the U.S. anti-terrorist efforts than was justified by the facts on the ground; they were more regularly positive than the analyses by the intelligence community's other agents," the report said in the press release.
"Centcom's events are unacceptable - our fighters in the war suffer when poor analyses are presented to senior decision-makers," Ken Calvert, California Republican, said.
The failure of Centcom's leadership reached the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the constant problems in the description and analysis of the USA's efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Even if it does not provide clear evidence that the high-ranking administrative authorities of Obama's administration have ordered reports to be flawed, it is a sign that analysts have felt that the leaders of Centcom had put pressure on them to describe the threat of the Islamic state, Isis, in a more positive light.
"For the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and certificates from the headquarters to Congress were much more positive than the events themselves", said the report.
For example, the Centcomi authority publicly stated that a major attack to take back Mosul could begin as early as in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still in Isis' possession.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear," said the opinion, MP Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas.
Between mid-2014 and mid-2015, the highest intelligence leaders at the US Military Forces headquarters manipulated the production of headquarters intelligence in order to reduce the threat of Isis in Iraq.
The Republicans set up a working group after hearing that analysts had raised concerns about the manipulation of intelligence on the Islamic state.
The report published on Thursday follows more extensive results as the investigation is under way.
The Ministry of Defence Oversight has begun an extra, ongoing investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, the Democrat members of the Chamber of Representatives' Intelligence Committee published their own findings that were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
" Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an excessively isolated process for the intelligence assessment of the security forces of Isis and Iraq," said Adam B. Schiff, the leader of the Committee, said.
According to Schiff, this process "longed the publication of intelligence outputs", made the atmosphere worse among analysts and did not "sufficient space for different perspectives".
Schiff and the Democrats said that they could not find evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom's analysts to adapt their conclusions to "pre-set or political report".
The Daily Beast will report on Tuesday on the preliminary results of the Congress investigation.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon Oversight has started an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commander Patrick Evans, representative of the Pentagon, said in the opinion that the Ministry of Defence does not comment on Congress's report for as long as an inspector's investigation is ongoing.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential issues of national security".
The investigation has other consequences than the question of whether the U.S. bombardment operations in Iraq and Syria are successful (as the growing number of defence authorities now claim).
Last year's accusations questioned how much President Obama can rely on the headquarters to provide honest estimates of the war activities of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis sites.
The criticism of the Islamic State inquiry reflects a dispute over a decade ago when Centcom's intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research article saying that despite the objections of several analysts, President George W. Bush's administration supported a small army in Iraq and spent very little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion on the intelligence of the Islamic State.
According to the authorities, last year, the Hooker Group concluded that, despite the opposite public statements, air attacks on the Islamic state-controlled refineries had not significantly undermined the terrorist group's economy because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil via the black market.
In September, however, the Times reported that this discovery was not reported outside the headquarters.
The Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, began to be criticised last year after many legislators considered his testimony to the Senate as an over-positive estimate of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and he replaced General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States will win for the fourth time in a row in women's countryhockey, organising an in-depth investigation with Britain.
The day after having scored three goals for the team winning Japan 6-1, Katie Bam scored on Thursday for the US Women's Groundhockey Team the first two goals for the Americans winning India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he wasn't sure if he'd done the same before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps records of his paintings."
But he knows this: the Americans are in the 4-0 Olympic tournament and they share their team first place with Britain, which was still unbeatable after Japan won on Thursday 2-0.
On Saturday, Britain and the United States will meet in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have survived the quarter-ranges, and this game will decide who will be the first and who will be the second in their six teams.
The first is to avoid a strong Dutch, the leader of the second group, at the start of a slightly longer quarter finals.
Whatever the end of Saturday’s game, the Americans have been horrified by their surprising success here, four years after they remained at the London Olympics for the last 12 teams.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in the Pennsylvania Blue Bell and picked up the groundhockeymail for the first time at the age of 3 (his parents played the species in Drexel) in connection with the country team at the age of 16, when he became the youngest player of all time.
He did not participate in the 2008 Olympics because he did not enter his final list of players.
In 2012, nothing went well for him and his teammates.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed as a coach, and things began to change.
"Culture change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the same speed of work in London as we do now.
We've made a full translation.
On Thursday night, Bam started the first half-time goal-making with a knuckle bet close to the finish line.
India had come into play with no profit in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the situation from 1-0 to the end of the third round, when Bam took over the situation.
He was carrying the ball for a long time on the left side of the field, and then he went into the middle of the field, and he pulled the ball into the goal, taking the Americans to the 2-0 line.
Melissa Gonzalez added the fourth round in the middle of the last goal.
This zero game was the first U.S. goalie Briggs to win one of each of the first three wins.
He's in a good mood.
So is Bam.
"We have a good situation now," Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
The peace of trampolin in the middle of the Olympics
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, the Olympics are on.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be a constant and inevitable message of competition and effort.
It's like the Olympic wave itself is a flaming signal capsule that's passed from a bow-stamp to a swimmer and a gymnast to a triathlonist.
It's impossible to turn on television, read the newspaper, or listen to the conversation with the guest in the coffee line without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the anger between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first timer of the Olympics and the future heart-breaker with a smile, could well be one of the names that everyone knows, presented in the best time of view, supported by sponsorship agreements and TV commercials of good mind - if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, from California Lake Forest, 28, is competing with Olympic gold in trampolin.
The Olympic League does not illuminate all species as much.
Farthest from the center, partly in the shadows, are those species that everyone generally does not accept: air gun fire, bow fire, featherball, taekwondo.
We always have a breast bath. Long live it.
But if I can make a moderate number of my special favors, I would like to draw attention to the restrained charm of trampolin.
Although trampolin has been an Olympic type since 2000, when it first appeared in Sydney, its presence in the last 16 years is so little that many of the people I interviewed didn't realize it was an Olympic species at all.
This could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the race, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete did not progress to the final until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians usually share the medals of men, Chinese and Canadian women.
This year, the Dong Dong of China and the Canadian Rosie McLenna defend their London gold medal.
Trampoliin, however, is accompanied by a certain kind of underdog’s charm, partly because, in an uncivilized way, it sounds better at clown school than at the Olympics.
Here I have to admit, I'm not an expert, I'm just an inability fan.
There are opportunities for amusingness in the species, as is observed by the color of endless pops of drawings, but it also has the nuance of gymnastics and swimming, two species which in principle combine.
The word "trampolin" comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means the stepping board.
The champions of the championship jump up to almost 30 feet with a giant trampoline, and they have to perform rocking business series (translations, skills and volts) and finally land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they will be assessed on the basis of implementation, difficulty and "flight time".
32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women compete in Rio.
The most common direction for the Olympic Games is straight ahead.
Those who hope for medals must go for gold as they look further, faster, up and over - sometimes to the finish, sometimes from around the field.
They hunt not only the line of paint or the wall of the beginning, but also, in television news, another gloomy border: a world record or an Olympics record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, and even fanatical, and can even get a viewer to tears.
But that is also the reason why watching the competitions can be a bit exhausting.
Trampoline offers you a resting moment.
Trampolin's up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The contestant rises up to a new ascension, as a weightless as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Of course, this is not about competition or difficulty, but there is no fierce rush towards the end during the programme, no jumps to the distance, just a sleepy, melting interruption of time and gravity.
It's as close to the Zen state as it can be to the Olympics.
Women's competitions and then the final will take place on Friday afternoon at the start of the broadcast at 13 (ET), men's competitions will also come on Saturday at 13:00.
NBC sends the finals as part of its afternoon software from 14 o'clock on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic drug they offer a quiet, charming moment, which most likely is not noticed in general chaos.
And if awareness is achieved only by providing male athletes to be stared and objectified (as the U.S. men's gymnasts suggested some time ago according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his pompous new fanry.
"The generation points to mind" in Ethiopia, a long-term ally of the United States
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
Political change in Ethiopia has been subjected to the government's violent opposition.
Witnesses say that dozens of protestors have been shot to death in conflicts with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking?
Over the last decade, it has been one of the most stable states in Africa, a strong West ally whose economy is growing rapidly.
In recent months, however, demonstrations against the government have shaken the country as it spreads to more and more areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed to the streets, calling for profound political change.
According to the Human Rights Groups, the government's response was ruthless.
Witnesses said the police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protestors.
The recorded videos recorded in demonstrations, which are believed to be at the end of last year or early this year, show how the security authorities beat young people on the sticks while they were forced to stand against the wall.
The United Nations High Human Rights Authority is now calling for a comprehensive study.
"It was always difficult to keep this country together, and it will be even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, project manager of the Horn of Africa in the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia, after Nigeria, is the second most popular country in Africa, and the Western countries appreciate its stability.
American military and intelligence services cooperate closely with Ethiopians in the fight against the terrorist threats of the region, especially in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much West aid.
The Ethiopian economy has grown at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved extremely much, and Addis Ababa, the capital, has even a new train for business travelers.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, although Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy, human rights organisations have been constantly talking about the repression of the government, the opposition of the country has been restricted and dissidents have been silenced effectively.
Many have been banished, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But this could be changing.
"If you suffocate people, and they have no choice but to show their minds, this will happen," Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher from Central Ethiopia, said.
All young people express their opinion.
A generation shows their minds.
Complaints are diverse and cover everything from land use to the strangulation of the dominant coalition.
After a lot of critical elections last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition, and now it holds all of Parliament's seats.
At the same time, tensions are growing at the border with Eritrea. The fight along this tight and controversial border took hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogade National Liberation Front, which have over recent years been more or less overthrown, may try to take advantage of the upheaval and to arm themselves again.
Numerous factors explain why, after years of falling under the surface, bitter feelings are about to explode.
The first seems to be seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last few years has a large number of Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more widespread and internet service has improved.
Even if the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate location via hidden network media servers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they gathered for demonstrations.
Secondly, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia, oroms and amhars, are getting better together.
Oroms and amhars are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the amhars, which come mainly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, were successful in politics and business, using the orms, many of which are Muslims and living on lows.
But this is changing, too.
"We're on our way to organization under one umbrella," said Oromo Director Mulu Gemechu.
The largest demonstrations have been in the Amhara and Oromo regions.
Many amhars and orphans think that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by the Tigre people, which covers about 6% of the population and controls the armed forces, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of unrest is the loss of Meles Zenaw.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
They thought he was a tactical genius, a man who saw around the corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly qualified to observe early signs of dissatisfaction and to use secret ambassadors to make opponents uncomfortable.
"The current administration has no basic instinct like it," said the conflict analyst Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desaleg, was picked up relatively unknownly to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say that the security services controlled by the tigers do not trust him.
Many fear that this may lead to increased bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia was in such a state of affairs in 2005, when thousands expressed their opinion on the elections, which, according to analysts, seemed to be the government’s first hurried and then robbed.
Many protestors died in the following blow, although less than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their views on infrastructure planning, such as the new business train, and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But this has clearly not stopped the internal contempt of the Ethiopian government from increasing.
And now it's getting a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protestors in Gondar, the city of Amhara, attacked companies owned by tigers, and the hate against Tigre becomes more and more common in social media.
Analysts say that demonstrations put the United States and the other Western allies in a position of clumsiness.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights to Somalia in the neighbouring country, although it said some time ago that it closed this base.
Although the Western countries clearly want to support democracy, they also do not want their allies in the unstable region to collapse.
"This," Abdi said, "there's a real balance."
Donald Trump explains Obama's fundamental father-in-law's claim to be "sudden"
Donald J. Trump tried to repress his latest campaign on Friday, claiming that he was not serious when this week he urged numerous times that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic state terrorist group.
The report raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also placed his defenders, who have plucked to defend him during a stormy period, in a difficult position, in which they must explain comments which he does not necessarily mean.
After a hint at the campaign meeting on Wednesday night, Trump was more and more keen to say in his interviews on Thursday, in which he urged that it really was his intention to say that the President and Clinton created Isis.
However, Trump said that he was only sarcastic in an early Friday morning's Twitter publication.
The publication was a complete version of the previous day when Trump said that he was indeed serious in several interviews.
When the conservative radio driver Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump reverse his remarks by reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate took this into his hearing ears.
The latest storm of criticism comes in a situation where Trump has tried to refocus his campaign in the midst of the results of the opinion polls that are falling into the economy.
Trump and Clinton fought when they talked about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday Trump tried to return to the subject again.
Again, on Twitter, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he was boring to talk.
Trump's been using sarcasm defense before.
Later in July, after he apparently faced a broad criticism when proposing that Russians should hack into Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his comments by saying, "Of course I am sarcastic".
The approach will allow Trump to attend the borders of political speech and then return if necessary.
"I think it's a model in which he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He sees how they work and then 'clears' in the direction of or depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is clever about his statements and knows that they are vague enough to filter them through several lenses.
Instead of mitigating what he has said for the big polling audience, Trump has been more blemish in recent days when his popularity has continued to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey published on Friday showed that Trump is well behind Clinton in northern Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tough in Florida.
Although Trump usually tries to avoid apologizing for things that provoke his words, he often accuses his critics of misunderstanding their words or misunderstanding their sense of humor.
As he faced an ever closer examination during the last few months of the presidential election campaign, Trump's jokes have forced his loyal allies into a uncomfortable position in which they must publicly support him regardless of how provocative his remarks are.
The former mayor of New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump’s most prominent supporters, worked hard to defend the candidate at CNN’s interview on Thursday.
"I believe that his words have real, political comments," Giuliani said when asked about the authenticity of Trump's argument that Obama and Clinton set up an Islamic state.
It is true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organization that he called amateur, completely wrong, and that is why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama government, in which Clinton worked as Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed Isis to get worse because it failed to deal effectively with the situation in the Middle East.
Before the Pennsylvania Friday meetings Trump continued to attack on Twitter towards the news media, who are chewing on his every word and are neutral against him.
He mocked the experts on "honey, pathetic" television who were trying to find out about him, saying, "They're not going to make it!"
Some Democrats mocked Trump's excuse for a new evidence that he was an inappropriate president.
Previous closed cafe returns to Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe was a nuisance, only cash-accepting place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network, but which offered good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, it was too expensive to have a bead on Bedford Avenue.
The store that replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cup-shaped soaps.
It was the last loss that the locals felt sorry for in a middle - class town that was being refurbished.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is crushed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if there's a change in New York, it's also re-inventing.
The revived Verb opened last November at Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
There's a Wi-Fi in the new Verb and you can pay with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and there's the same unpretentious atmosphere.
The coffee's still good, too.
The new Verb is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old cafe, who is the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started in Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.
When the customer offered to fund him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things the same.
Verb uses the same bagel reporter and bought a similar espresso.
It even used old Verb's lights.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try too.
He brought some new ingredients.
Bacon egg cheese sandwiches are available on the menu, and there are cauliflowers and browned onions in the coatings.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
They don't serve beer at the coffee shop anymore, but they make fresh juices there.
In the course of nine months, Rodriguez says that he's discovered that he's found a steady flow of old regular customers.
"Williamsburg was too expensive also for many former customers," he said.
Last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of these customers.
Oliveira, 34, once lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
After he moved to Greenpoint, he went to the cafe.
He says after Verb closed, he gave up on coffee for a second.
"I understood that I enjoyed Verb's coffee and culture," he said.
Now he has returned to coffee, even though that day he ordered a mixed chai drink instead of his usual ice coffee, which is one of the new additions.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, visited Verb faithfully since 2003.
He went to work there before, and he always made the same order.
"Every day fifteen more than seven, regularly than the clock, I went in and they were preparing a spiced bagelian with butter," he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to do some experiments and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today Rosenthal is still making his usual order, but sometimes because of the variation he has the space for a delicious bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he's not carrying a grudge to the soap shop that took over the old facilities.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb, which would be used as a ingredient for coffee in the coffee shop.
"I think we can still stick to the offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also accepted a cafe.
One of these new clients turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said that he was soon planning to set it up for a point in order to make his new neighbours feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice place wants to bottle and sell some frozen coffee.
It is possible that the cafe will expand into the next building.
Many customers have enough to get their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular client and said it was comforting when the place was closed down.
When the new place was opened, Whitt said he felt like he was coming home walking in and ordering a coffee.
"I wanted to smell it," he said.
A Square Meal: Disasterable Food of Malignant Period
In March 1933, soon after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in his office room.
The delicious direction President Roosevelt liked the sophisticated Fifth Avenue dishes, such as the goose-painting, and Maryland’s swamp soup.
On that day, his diet was less modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato sauce, and desserts from plums.
"It was a demonstration of culinary solidarity for the people who suffered," Jane Ziegelman said.
His wife, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
A couple in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, told me about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told me about life in the Lower East Side's apartment building through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest cooperation, A Square Meal, which Harper publishes on Tuesday, is the history of American food during the great recession of the 1930s.
By demonstrating some kind of culinary solidarity, they meet the supplier at a dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, unpretentious lunch bar in Flatiron, which has been active since the fall of the stock exchange since 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich, and Coe, 57, took the dose with turkey, potato and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered the meatloaf, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss the discussion about eating the recession.
"The shrubs were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was a peanut chip, a liver chip, a bean chip.
They were made of a manufacturing material and some cheap ingredient that continued the actual material.
Imagine eating so much peanuts that they would form your dinner.
Coe did.
"It must have felt like lead in the stomach," he said.
In years before the recession on American tables, especially in rural areas, it was like eating-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-it-it-all-it-it-all.
Women’s groups made food for male farm workers, and fresh pies were served at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
The Americans sent food to the hungry Europeans during World War I. The book A Square Meal crowned the ways in which the nation survived that suddenly it was no longer a land of abundance.
"The food then became a key, distressing subject for the Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was a new, affordable diet: Mystery dishes, such as cans and boxes, became the main food, and the box was "a powerful way to use food stars", mentioned Ziegelman, because the chefs were able to hide less attractive ingredients under the creamy sauce layer.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
The meat, which had been at the center of the American meals for years, became a sustainable luxury product.
Special ingredients were tested for calories and nutrients when more important than taste or even healthy senses in the kitchen.
Ziegelman also prepared an age course of food where roasted onions were filled with peanut butter when he made the study for a book containing recipes.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the dinner table," Coe said.
Ziegelman said, "It was unreal."
The peanut butter is in no way suitable for roasted onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Households Agency in 1923-1943, guided the country’s eating habits more than ever before or after.
Public recipes and articles in newspapers and periodicals they encouraged women to become "budgets" and to respond to the challenge of converting mussels such as the degenerate spaghetti and carrots into delicious doses.
The Square Meal is a celebration of historical treats.
Particularly tasty are reports of government reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover, let me eat your cake gun.
At the same time as he publicly praised his child’s simple, Iowa country food, he was eating like a sophisticated millionaire who had become him.
"He liked continental food, like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate a tux on his head in a nearly-gold dining room.
She was great out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not encouraged him to set an example on his own stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place that "not only offered food that was one of Washington's oldest, but also the worst-made."
Many of the low - age eating habits were abandoned as soon as the land got back on its feet.
The legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when writing the book, they gained a better understanding of the eating habits of the mother of Ziegelman, such as how she could not throw away food.
"He was really afraid to waste food," Coe said.
Ziegelman remembered, "He even sickened people."
There's been a windmill.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe drew up the dessert they had prepared at home: the blizzard meal that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called a plum foam," Ziegelman said adding that the general trick was to give a name that looked like small recipes.
There was no cream foam, only plums, some flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
Everyone accidentally sunk their spoons into a sticky, brown glue.
I'm surprised it wasn't bad.
Coe was blackmailing me once, and he was blackmailing me again.
Sounding like a positive budgeter, he told his wife, "a little bit of chopped walnuts could help."
Gilead will be reimbursed for legal expenses in the hepatitis C patent fight against Merck
The U.S.O. has ordered that Gilead Sciences Inc be entitled to receive the costs incurred by it in the dispute against Merck & Co Inc, a pharmaceutical manufacturer for hepatitis C.
In June, Gilead was released for 200 million dollars after they broke the two Merck patents associated with Gilead’s success medicine in Sovald and Harvoni, which was followed by the U.S. judge’s finding of Merck abuses involving false oaths and other ethical practices.
In a judgment delivered on Thursday, U.S. engagement judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to be released from the compensation it incurred against the claim.
Merck is trying to catch Gilead, which controls the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines, which can significantly cure more than 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck challenged each other in the court of ownership of the active substance in Gilead medicines sofosbuvir based laboratory work.
United States-supported troops say they've completely taken over Isis-controlled Manbij
Since the last remaining Isis fighters left town, the group's representative said on Friday, the US supported troops have taken the northern town of Manbij near the Turkish border.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (DF) are now investigating the city after the last group of fighters hidden in the city left.
The troops had released more than 2,000 wing hostages, held captive by the fighters, from the SDF of Sharfan Darwish, the Manbij Military Council, told Reuters.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we have begun to investigate it," he told Reuters.
Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2% of federal taxes.
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published its 2015 tax return, which showed that the income of the Democratic presidential candidate and his spouse in that year was $10.75 million, and that their real federal tax rate was 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated a million dollars to charities organisations, mainly the Clinton Foundation, and former President Bill Clinton made nearly $ 5.3 million in speakers' compensation, and the former Foreign Minister announced that he had received 3 million publishers from Simon & Schuster in his book, which told him about his career as a foreign minister.
Clinton's vice president, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton, published ten years of tax returns.
Their actual federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set a standard for economic transparency", the campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in the opinion.
As a sharp contrast to this Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdraws his earlier promises to publish his tax returns.
As usual, US presidential candidates publish their tax returns, even though the law does not oblige them to.
New York Businessman Trump and his lawyers have called for the tax administration's audit as a reason for refusing to publish tax returns.
"Your turn", Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams said on Twitter when he published a link to the tax returns of the Democratic candidate.
On Thursday, Trump’s special assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audit is complete.
Trump's critics, including President of the Republic of 2012, Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal to raise questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his transactions and numerous other ties to Russia, for example.
Clinton has taken up the problem on Friday’s published online video, bringing out the visible Republicans who are calling on Trump to publish their taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the problem in his economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every candidate for president in recent decades has done: published his tax returns," he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very little taxes in the two 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist quoted a number of tax lawyers and accountants who said that the situation could still be the same.
The federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a billionaire investor named according to Warren Buffett, which would ensure that more than a million dollars a year would pay at least 30% of taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At Clinton’s meeting in Nebraska’s Omaha last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway consortium is located there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said that he also has an audit of the tax administration, and that Trump did not "fear" the tax collector, but the voters.
The Clinton campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
Today, the actual federal tax rate of the Clintons in Chappaqua, New York, was around 32 per cent between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined tax rate was about 40,5 per cent.
Clinton's tax return for 2015 showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investee was a low-cost, index-linked investment fund, and Clinton reported USD 109 000 in dividends and interest income.

Chili powder condoms and twilights enhance the elephant protection of Tanzania
The conservationists in Tanzania use an unusual way to prevent elephants from roaming into human areas - they throw animals with chili powder-filled condoms.
The technology has proven to be effective, and several years ago the Honeyguide Foundation, together with the American Nature Conservancy, has enhanced its advertising by training volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step way of protecting homes and hundreds of people without the animals being injured.
In the past, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is the elephant day of the world dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since we developed...tools, we have discovered a change of attitude in these communities, which is now much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them," says the Executive Director of Honeyguide, Mr Bell.
The first two steps are to show an elephant with a flashlight and to play a horn.
If it doesn't stop the animal, we throw the so-called chili cloud.
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and soil, and the condom is then rotated so that only the ignition wire remains visible.
When the condom is set on fire, it bursts with a bang and blows out a chilli powder dust into the air.
One smell is usually enough to send an elephant in the other direction.
The last way is by triggering a Roman candle into the air. The fireworks produces a loud, bright explosion.
RT news: The Jewish filmmaker criticises the Berlin hotel that removed the Israeli directional number at the request of the Arabs
The French filmmaker, a Jewish-based filmmaker, released the media storm after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israel's heading number.
Claude Lanzmann, who made the Shoah documentary about the Holocaust, was frustrated with the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel, writing an open letter in a German version of the FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find the Israeli hotel in the country’s indexes.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How can it be that in 2016 in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been removed and wiped out?
Lanzamann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through his own telephone centre.
When looking for an explanation, the filmmaker took the matter up at the hotel reception.
Lanzamann wrote that the answer from there was "suffered him".
The hotel receptorist said it was a "considered decision of the management of Kempinski hotels".
The reason behind the decision was even more shocking in the filmmaker.
"The greatest part of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of the Israeli index," the employee is said to have said according to Lanzmann.
Israeli German Ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman calls the case a "great injustice", Zuddeutsche Zeitung reports.
"We were terrified and shocked by the incident.
It is already a great injustice in itself.
But even greater shame is that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain.
There's no need to explain this.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident produced quite a counter-reaction online when people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel simply "giveed up" to the alleged demands of the Arabs.
"Hätvak" was said in another publication, which pointed out that the hotel on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm is standing near the synagogue.
The hotel itself denied all charges quickly and called what had happened "inaccuracy" and "sorry" from Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
"The clear order not to include Israel in the shortlist was never made," said Kempinski's representative according to Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the direction number has now been added.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students
On Thursday, the students met with the police in Sao Paulo, Brazil, when the students gathered to protest against the reform of the government's public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protestors.
The problems began when lawkeepers tried to disintegrate the student population, which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to express their horror about the plans.
According to the proposals of Governor Paulo Geraldo Alckmin of Sao Paolo, less than 100 public schools would be closed and 300 000 pupils would be reinvested to save money.
Some of the participants in the demonstrations were seen writing anti - President Michel Temer's graffiti on the walls.
This latest demonstration took place only days after the protesters took off as a group to support President Dilm Rousseff, who was arrested when the Senate of the country voted on his official charges.
RT business: Russian-Iran trade is growing suddenly by 71%
Since the abolition of sanctions, the net sales of trade between Moscow and Tehran have increased by 70.9 per cent from the previous year, says Russian Ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagarya.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were removed, Russian companies have shown a great deal of interest in transactions in the country, said the Ambassador.
Russian companies continue their existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
"Of course one of the main objectives of Iran's bilateral cooperation is to expand trade," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the net sales of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015, with a total of USD 856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5% to a total of $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16% to $158 million.
"The increase in trade was achieved by supplying machinery, vehicles and weapons", Ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan is expecting a record of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign representation in Iran issued approximately 35 000 visas to Iranian citizens mainly for travel.
Iran was also for the first time among the 20 countries most visited by tourists in Russia.
"It is safe to say that last year's record of Iranian Christians in Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians are visiting Iran, which the Ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi. They have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Scotti Callum Skinner fell into the paint as the British caught the bike gold
Scotland Callum Skinner honoured the men at the men's team press at the Rio Cycling Stadium last night when the British team's trio defended its championship from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was an anchor in the role of his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy, who was proud of the young man when he got to the finish line, catching the pre-supervised favorite of victory from the New Zealand team.
Britain took the shock victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympics.
And they kept repeating the trick after their modest sixth position in the March race World Championships in London, even though Hoy has since decided on his competitive career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Special Envoy Jamie Staff.
This was done just in time when Hindes appeared.
Hoy's ending also created a void that Kia Emad and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
Skinner was a man whom British coaching kept up with in the Scots the potential that has now been understood.
Hindes, Kenny... who won the championship with Hoy four years ago... and Skinner took the Olympic record at the time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British three won a duel of gold.
After his own tour, Hindes was right behind him, but Kenny stabbed the team, and Skinner held on to it.
The strategy change was a large part of the transformation and included Hindes driving at a bigger turn to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to stick to the pace.
Hoy followed his position as an expert at the BBC and drew the attention of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they entered the award-rate.
A 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "Verting is flattered."
I'm just here to do my best to get a reputation.
We made an Olympic record in the final and won the world champions.
It was amazing.
There can't be a better way to win.
After winning London in 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindies admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a bad start.
He later withdrew his comments and the British competitors did not complain.
This time there was no similar problem with force majeure.
Hindes said, "It felt like he was in London when there were so many British tickets on the foot."
As a team, we found contact in the last three months.
We have lost so many world titles, so winning the Olympics again is simply wonderful.
One event, one gold medal for the people, who won seven of the ten types of cycling in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we will be expected to have a successful five-day cycling stadium.
Based on Kenny's good looks, it's not impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's urinalysis, winning three Olympics in the Olympics.
That would mean that Kenny, which is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on March 23rd (the apparently sacred day of British sports, which is also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday), would be raised to six gold and one silver.
It's the same as Hoy's.
Kenny's next competition for a sprint that starts today and lasts for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I just enjoyed one of these.
The team race is always the best.
We're gonna win it with our friends.
To be honest, winning alone is lonely."
Hindes said, "If he wins the other two gold medals, he should be given the value of the knight."
This was the only medal competition of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and the Owain Doull were the fastest in time for four lives, a four-mile drive.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The world record that won gold in London is 3:51:659.
The first round and the final (22.42) will take place today, on the second day of competition, when Wiggins will certainly be the focus of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before the time-spans when the officials called him for a long-term measurement.
In a similar competition for women, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Millgavi Katie Archibald made progress during the world record time at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its great team of bicycles will take over the centre of the Olympic Games and reach the whole set of medals.
After presenting truly exceptional and complete control in Beijing and London, expectations have been reduced before Rio.
There has been a drama in the background, the least of which has not been the difference between a technical director, Shane Sutton, in April because of the accusations of sexism and temptation, and the end of the race of great people, such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the first night’s competitions at the cycling stadium, it seems that the legendary reputation of Britain now rises to its peak at a perfect moment could once again be true.
The molten future of Portland due to the reduction of the electricity contract
The future of the Victorian aluminium smelt, as well as hundreds of workers, is uncertain when an electricity-distributing electricity company revealed that one of the plant's owners is concluding a distribution agreement, so it is expected that all distribution contracts will be cut.
The measure follows the decision of the Victorian administration earlier this year that the aid required for the operation of the plant will not be extended.
The 20-year period will end in November.
Even 2,000 jobs could be in danger at the Alcoan Portland plant.
Even 2000 jobs may be at risk, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the plant.
In addition, the snowball effect may be possible, as the melter uses approximately 10% of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's fuse, which led to the closure of the Anglesea plant last year.
Alcoan Portland's melter loses money and is under closure threat.
The measure is now following the speculation of several years since the future of the plant, which began as a result of a strong Australian dollar and has recently been the result of the cost of manufacturing the plant.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminium alloy from its Loy Yang An plant in Latrobe Valley, said that it also expects three other owners to conclude their contract.
Most of the factory is owned by the Alcoa and Aluminium Association, and the Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
"AGL is waiting for the activities of the Portland plant to continue, which means that the unmolten physical demand for electricity will continue," he said.
According to AGL, the agreements are so-called 'protection agreements', which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The agreements have a notice period of 12 months, so they will actually end in 2017.
"For this reason, AGL expects contracts to produce results in the financial year 2017," said the electricity company.
All possible results for AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by the strong prospects of the wholesale electricity future market.
AGL said that it has already "predicted the end" to reduce the value of contracts in its accounts by $187 million.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the agreements "do not affect Alco's ... ability to keep the melting operation in place or to secure the unsmelling power supply".
The US company said that it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 and that it had to enter into force in November of this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew.
Analysts have been guarded by both the molten Portland in Victoria and the possible closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, as the economic situation in the sector is poor.
Earlier this week, Stephen Mikkelsen, CEO of AGL, told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomago about 900 megawatts per year.
"If both plants exit the market, this is a significant reduction in [electricity] market demand.
For us as a power producer, this would not be a good thing," he said.
Kendall, not just Kardashian's real-time TV star, is on the cover of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20 model and the fourth daughter of the Kris Kardashian-Jenner clan, a mother-manger, are on the cover of the September issue of the U.S. Vogue.
Kendall, who is the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and modelled in Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news on Thursday in his Instagram account.
"Looking at this cover in a room full of loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover was followed by a unique (or perhaps only suitable for the Kardashian style?), a scripted reality video, where the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (except for problems Rob and Caitly, accompanied by everyone's favorite entertainment producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot about his sister's cover, but which ended up in the classic turn: they planned a surprise party.
It is about the cliché of almost every children's TV series of the "day of birth", but Krisin had to somehow make his other girls profit from this publicity.
This is because we have certainly moved to the new Kardashian era with the location of the September Vogue.
Kendall’s big sister Kim may have reached Vogue’s claim first (he shared it with his husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is quite its own.
Vogue's September number is the largest edition of the year.
Its thickness is more like a coffee protocol than a fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion reduced 615 out of 832 pages last year).
Its cover is so fiercely expected to be exposed that during the last two years, images of the magazine have leaked before official publication.
Previous women on deck include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelil, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have indeed been more "published" models on the cover than "malles that are celebrities".
Oscar's winner and Dior's ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on deck in 2013, after Lady Gaga's place of honor.
But if it happened that Jenner, pictured by his generation as a "success model", would hit his first-mentioned category, he's in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives or reality stars of famous people, or young people today who can make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of this).
They are rightly gifted women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
Last year’s cover model Beyonce has been one of the strongest years of his career with the publication of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is pleased with Jenner's success.
His true-TV history will always be a pain in Jenner's position in the fashion world.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model, Stephanie Seymour, criticised Jenner and her colleague, Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitch of this moment".
This feeling came back on the surface with Jenner's Vogue.
But in dissatisfaction, spinning is irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
He's a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's gonna sell you Estee Lauder's makeup cream.
He and all of his sisters will sell you pictures of themselves in their own applications from behind the wall of payment.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter he took for the Live magazine.
And on his leisure day, possibly just to see his sister Kourtney and her kids, he's a real-time TV star.
Community legal centres are turning 160 000 people away every year.
More than 160 000 of the most vulnerable will be turned away from the Community's legal centres each year, as the sector prepares for the impact of additional financial cuts on its already far-reaching activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly of the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no chance of fighting unfair exodus and similar - are already being turned away in their search for free legal advice and representation.
Legal services already stretched to the extremes of the Community are preparing for further cuts.
Next June, these legal centres are due to lose 30% of their federal funding.
James Farrell, Head of the Legal Centres of the Queensland Community, said that according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres, thousands of people are already being turned away annually.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not withdrawn, the situation will only get worse.
"Queensland Community legal centres are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are turned away from the essential services they need each year," he said.
People starting from violent relationships with uncontrolled and wretched debts, separated families, unfairly separated workers - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30% in June 2017, which means that thousands of vulnerable Queensland residents will be forced to navigate in the midst of complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately withdraw these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the State Government implemented its promise to increase the funding of legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the Community Legal Centre and their customer communities, and the Palaszczu government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was sued after the employee was claimed to be armed with a weapon.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for claiming that they did nothing after being told that the head of the campaign's operation in North Carolina threatened the employee with a gun in February while they were driving in Jeep.
The incident was described in the application lodged by Vincent Bordin, former software intern of the state's campaign, in Charlotte, State Court on Wednesday.
Bordini said that he waited months for the situation to be handled internally before he realized that 'it would not happen'.
Chief Earl Phillip "take out the pistol, put his right front finger on the trigger and shoved the pipe against Vincent's kneecap", Bordini said in the complaint.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini heard that at least four other persons had had similar experiences with Phillip, said in the complaint.
"There's no need to launch items to cause damage," Bordini said in the complaint.
The challenge comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused anger in telling the public in North Carolina that "the people of the second addition" - which usually covers the owners and armaments of weapons - could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and elected judges.
The Trump campaign said that the media has taken his word out of context, and that he does not support violence.
The challenge for Bordin is to seek compensation from the campaign for reckless supervision and from Phillip for violence, abuse and emotional shock.
Mr Hicks, representative of Trump, did not respond immediately to the request for a comment.
The attempts to reach Phillip failed.
WCCB, local newsgirl Charlote reports Phillip has recently left the campaign.
His consultant’s request for a call to Innovative Consulting Services was not immediately answered.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign has been controversial.
The case against Bordini is Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
The British must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and flowering the whole stomach, not just to local communities and different parts of London.
For me, this was Heathrow's great charm, just as it was also the charm of London's 2012 competitions, when we worked hard to ensure that all our peoples and regions benefit from the competition.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and East End.
And we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, 10 000 new trainees and 40 000 new jobs will be created, and youth unemployment around the airport will be eliminated.
As before the London 2012 competitions, some will think that the challenge of extending Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the competition and that we would be ashamed of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they're gonna be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow will answer every question that is put to it.
As with the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and 211 billion pounds of economic growth, as well as leave the legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and around the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a infrastructure investment programme of £11 billion in time and in the budget: from T5, which has been voted the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row, to T2, built between the two most urgent runways in the world.
Now the team is ready to carry out a third runway, supported by 16 billion pounds of private money.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for Great Britain, and I am convinced that Heathrow's expansion is that too.
It is time we channel the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, ensure the future of our trade and create a heritage of skills and employment, of which Britain can be proud.
Lord Paul Deighton is the chairman of Heathrow Board and former trade secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook cat and mouse game to prevent advertising
For companies that receive money from online advertising, companies bypass the anti-advertising program are "cat and mouse", said one of the companies that manufacture such a program.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would prevent advertising inhibitors from using its computer pages, Adblock Plus published a blog entry saying that users can update the software filters to prevent advertising again on the social network pages.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that the code of its websites is exchanged around advertisements to make it more difficult for advertisers to detect which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says it's surrounded by a new code.
In a blog article, Adblock’s representative Ben Williams wrote that “a similar back and forth struggle between an open source advertising community and its tourers has been in progress since the anti-promotion of advertising was invented” and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with its own solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of the great tragedy that advertising inhibitors have become for industry.
Globally, some 200 million people use advertising inhibitors, reported in the last year's Pagefair and Adobe survey, which is almost four times the amount that used these programmes in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now covers 84 per cent of Facebook's advertising revenues.
However, the company is after the ads on the websites used on the computer, as mobile ads do not work for Facebook mobile applications on social network or Instagram, said the representative.
Computer commercials continue to generate enough income to keep Facebook's view that such an action is worth investing.
On Tuesday, Facebook also said that it would update its "advertise" tool to give people more power as to how advertising is targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters were worrying because they would also prevent some of the site’s non-advertising content.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem," the Facebook representative said in the e-mail report.
Advertising inhibitors are boring tools, which is why we are instead focused on building tools such as Ad Preferences that give people control.
She got hit by a car on the Swiss freeway, apparently because of suicide.
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for witnesses after a woman was found on the freeway under several vehicles on Thursday’s early hours in a case apparently suicide.
The incident took place on the A1 road near Morges in Vaud's canton just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman did a "desperate act" and lay down in the dark on a road in which several vehicles hit her, the Vaud police said in the opinion.
The victim who clearly tried to kill himself was a 49-year-old Swiss woman hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
She died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the event have already been questioned, but not all of them have been identified, reported by the police, who appeals to them and all witnesses who have witnessed an incident.
The crime investigation has begun, which is a " logical" step in this type of situation, the lawyer Gilles Hofster told Le Tribune de Genevelle.
"However, it remains to be seen whether any of the involved drivers will be prosecuted.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
It's left to the prosecutor," Hofster said.
Two similar cases over the last five years suggest that drivers are not held liable.
In either case, where there was a person on both roads who was walking in the dark, it was estimated that motorists could not wait to meet a pedestrian on the freeway in the middle of the night, said the magazine.
Last year, the police were released from the charges of non-compliance after he hit and killed a man lying on the A! road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out, the court was informed.
The Court stated that the police, who was responding to the emergency call, were driving in a reasoned manner, and that the presence of the man on the road was 'a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation', the judge said.
Anyone with information on Thursday's incident near Morges should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus had to live once
According to NASA's new climate model estimates, Venus was likely to live once.
Scientists at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus's past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus would have been hot, anhydrous with its surfaces and filling carbon dioxide with its air-developed conditions could sometimes have been earth-like.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus’s slow speed explain its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earthlike atmosphere, and still could have been running slowly.
The model also looked at early Venus surface formation.
The planet probably had drier areas than Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical variation to allow life and from the rapid flooding of water to protection.
The advantage of early Venus was also 30 per cent lower sun.
"In the simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus reveals it to the sun on the side of the sun for almost two months at a time," explains Anthony Del Genio, a GISS researcher in the news release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick cloud layer that acts as an umbrella protecting the surface from the sun’s heat.
The final result is that the average temperature of the climate is actually a few degrees cooler than the present on Earth.
The model produced Venus's developmental story, which is similar to what the planet scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was likely to live, it was exposed to excessive heat and UV light over several billion years.
Its oceans vanished and its water vapours burned in the UV light.
When its hydrogen escaped, only a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with the deadly greenhouse gas phenomena of Venus, which we know today.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.

On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned from the activities of Coach Colorado Avalanche and Deputy Director General for hockey affairs, i.e. the lack of influence on the team's decision-making process.
Mr Sakic, Deputy Executive Director/President of Colorado, confirmed the information and noted that the team would begin searching for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have done my duty as Deputy Director General and Chief Coach of hockey, Colorado Avalanche, with enthusiasm, passion and determination", Roy, 50-year-old said in the opinion.
During the summer, I have long and hard thought about how I could improve this team in order to give it the depth it needs and bring it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the position of the coach and Vice-President of the hockey affairs must be fully in line with the approach of the organisation.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the team’s performance.
These conditions are currently not being met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and hope for his happiness in the future.
Roy was appointed as the winner of the Jack Adams Award award to the best coach in the League during the first Avalanche period 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and the victory of the middle division, but Minnesota dropped Colorado in the first round of the playoffs, and the team has not been able to continue in the last two years.
Avalanche's games in 2015-16 ended with 39 wins, 39 wins and 4 games, and the team lost by five points to Wild, losing the wild card slot of the Western conference.
Hall of Fame's elected goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups - two both in the Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue to negotiate and delay the strike
When all the parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the leading negotiators said, the labour struggles of the oil workers in the North Sea are postponed due to pay.
The Wood Group’s oil-field service company has been randomly organised with the Royal Dutch Shell-led North Sea drills.
"The Wood Group and the Unit and RMTs can confirm that we have agreed to resume the process of resolving the current dispute", read in the joint opinion.
Over the next few weeks, we will hold several full-day meetings starting early next week so that we can take a fresh look at the problems.
According to trade unions, their recent work-related efforts, which they say would be the first for more than 25 years, were opposed to possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
This year Wood Group cut the commissions of North Sea contractors by about 9 % due to negative market pressure.
The company's remuneration reduction follows a 10% reduction in the number of contractors in its country from 2014.
The company said that further operations would give the company the necessary room to cope with the decline in the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has reduced thousands of people from its pay lists and has announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, while the company reduces its operations as a result of its giant merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by the British June decision to leave the European Union.
Mr Dave Anderson, a Scottish Member of this House, met with all the co-chairs earlier this week to discuss one of the largest labour disputes in the North Sea.
He said that the North Sea is essential to the economy of the region.
"We need an economy that works for many, not just a few, both in the North Sea and in the whole country," he said in the opinion.
The North Sea is expected to have less than USD 1.4 billion in new projects in 2016, while the average of the previous five years has been around USD 7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of star rotation in the plejad star range
The most recent task of Kepler Space is to help astronomers collect the most complete list of the speeds of spin of the stars of the Pleiade Star Corps.
The new information will help astronomers to understand why the stars of the constellation are spinning at varying speeds, and how the orbits are related to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other constellations, we will learn more about the relationship between mass, age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, Researcher at the Pasadena Centre, in the press release
It is located 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many of the stars have been born some 125 million years ago and are now reaching adulthood.
They're running top-notch now.
At its peak speed, these adult stars are pouring large amounts of starwind.
As these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they act as a brake on the stars.
As the star matures, its speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measure the speed of rotation of each star by monitoring the appearance of identifiable star spots, such as sunspots.
The latest list of star rotation rates suggests that the more massive stars will rotate more slowly than the less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, of which larger makes the pies slower than the smaller ones.
"In the Balet of Baletas," Rebull said, "we see that slow spinners are usually more massive.
Since the plejads are so close, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory for assessing the characteristics of the stars at the speeds of rotation.
"The star band of the Peljads offers an anchor for the rotation of stars into theoretical models that cover both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, because and why the stars slow down their rotational speed and, so to speak, hang their dancing shoes on the nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of Plejad's speeds in three articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
