Camille Auer wanted to fix her sex, she was diagnosed with mental illness, and now she's doing art on the subject, "Man should have the right to his own body."
There are dozens of patient reports hanging from the roof of the Project Room Gallery at the Academy of Fine Arts.
Each one says the name of Camille Auer.
The papers tell a multi-annual story about how people outside the world have written down their interpretations of Auer and his identity.
He's the one who decided who he is.
"I wanted to tell a person my immediate medical history, so that the violence of the process could be seen," Auer says.
In the process, he's referring to the sex correction process.
It is often a year-long trial involving meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process begins with the transmission of "gender identity disorder" diagnostic studies to be carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
With Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before this, he had used the estrogen he ordered over the Internet and was already very long in his own repair process.
He felt that he was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person has to go through the process of repairing the sex, so that it can also be legally corrected.
The Translaw, i.e. the Act on Transsek for the establishment of social sex (563/2002), obliges trans-sex people to be forced into forced sterilisation in order to obtain the right sex, for example, at the Population Register Centre and passports.
At the moment, everyone who repairs their gender is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and a certificate of infertility.
You have the right to decide on your own body.
"This situation is unacceptable and violates human rights," says Auer.
The reform of the Translaw has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has adopted eight observations on the law and the European Court of Justice has a preliminary ruling requiring the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect their right to self-determination.
The previous Finnish government prepared the amendment of the law under the leadership of Susanne Huovinen, then Minister of Social Affairs and Health.
The elections and the Finns of Peru rose to the government.
Now the law is stuck again.
It is a matter of internal political disputes which are not even related to this law.
"The administration does not want to put it on the table because there are differences within the government about the amendment of the law," says Frank Johansson, Executive Director of the Finnish Directorate of Amnesty.
The front part of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
One of these is the packaging and instructions for use of Auer.
In the patient report installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of the transpole psychologist at Tampere University Hospital in Auer.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and based on these reports, which should define the treatment of Auer’s law and the access to assistance.
The consciousness of the reality under investigation appears to be exposed to perversion.
The understanding of the subject himself appears to be fragmented in a way that is at the level of the limit, and the unstable features of the personality are highlighted.
Auer didn't recognize himself from these descriptions.
"It was shocking to hear that I was diagnosed mental," Auer says.
There was even greater shock when Auer was not given treatment for the correction of sex.
According to his staff, his resources were not sufficient to initiate the process.
He was denied his own identity.
Then, on 11 February 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the Transpole's waiting lobby off TV.
Later, that television produced an art work called Monument for the Exclusive, where Auer reflects his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that any person defined as a woman in a birth can magnify their breasts, but they need a diagnosis to remove their breasts," Auer says.
Your body is not yours if you feel that you are other than the amount of your sex defined in birth.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not the only one.
The gender correction process is more severe for many mental reasons than for purely medical operations.
Its passers meet dozens of people who need to justify their own existence and the right to their own sexual experience.
"It is crazy that people who are in need of support and help are denied treatment, calling on their resources not to be enough," Auer says.
Many people who have applied for the process have a history of psychiatric symptoms: depression, anxiety, possible harassment experiences.
On this basis, medical staff may order that treatment cannot be initiated.
"Prohibiting access to care and help can make a person worse than it was before the process started," Auer says.
Auer’s own exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the exhibition publication, Auer writes: "I have had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life and that is what people usually find difficult to melt".
The depression has been treated with drugs, and when Auer started using hormones, it made you feel better.
He had finally been able to express the feelings that had existed since he was a child and a teenager.
Why the wide jaw did not seem to fit into its own body and why the chest muscles had to be round instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer is that there are people near him who see him.
To be seen is a basic need.
"It takes so much to justify it by talking, dress, sound and movement," he says.
Today Auer is already experiencing his coming to be seen, he exists as a woman.
However, at the beginning of the process, random comments from loved ones could have hurt a lot.
It's the most painful thing to do when people who are close to each other are wrong.
"They should know who I am, and they know who I am, but they won't agree or be able to internalize it," he continues.
However, not all transhumans need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, or conflict of body, in which the body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and a long process of research, it is not possible to obtain official confirmation of its own sex.
"There is no medical basis for these studies," Auer says.
And it's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal sex.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination in relation to legal sex.
A full-time applicant makes a written application for a new identity card, stating that he or she is experiencing another sex.
After a period of six months, the applicant shall confirm his application in writing and the Ministry shall give the applicant a new identification.
This right of self-determination is also required in Finland, and this requirement is also subject to the Auer exhibition.
It has not been a therapy experience for the artist, but is a political and artistic collection.
I want to believe that art is still a priority and that it can bring about political change at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

The Civil Society issued a travel warning to Missouri.
The Afro-American National NAACP has issued a travel warning for Missouri because of the discriminatory practices of the state and the racist attacks there.
"The NACP's travel release for Missouri enters into force on 28 August 2017 and calls on African-American tourists, visitors and local residents to pay particular attention and to exercise extreme caution when travelling to a state in which there have recently been a number of questionable racial events", the Organization's Communication states.
The law recently in force in Missouri makes it difficult to export cases of discrimination to court, and the implementation of state law is disproportionate to minorities, according to the NAACP, which led to the provision of travel warnings.
People's civil rights are being violated.
They are stopped on the basis of the color of the skin and are being assaulted or killed," said Rod Chapel, the chairman of NAACP's Missouri, said to Kansas City Star.
"We've never heard of as many cases in just as short a time."
The travel notice for Missouri is the first warning for the United States of America.
The organisation mentioned racist comments against African-American students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old Tory Sanders from Tennesse.
Sanders died in question earlier this year, and he was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel, and Missouri's police arrested him even though he wasn't charged with a crime.
The travel notice also referred to the report by the Minister of Justice of Missouri that the police would be more likely to stop the black driver than the white one.
"The purpose of the travel newsletter is to encourage people to be alert and to warn their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri," Chapel says.
"People must prepare themselves, for example, by including money to pay bail or by telling relatives that they intend to travel through the state."
According to the F.B.I., in 2015, one hundred hate crime was recorded in Missouri, the 16th most in the United States.
The travel warning is also an answer to Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult for companies to challenge to the law on discrimination in housing and employment.
The ACLU, which was guaranteed by the Constitution, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona following the adoption of immigration laws which oblige the police to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to the organisation, increase racial profiling.
In general, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs publishes travel warnings and they concern other countries, but in recent times, NGOs have published them in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for a report on the additional pension of the Executive Director
Mika Lintilä (Central) has asked Finnair, Minister of Economic Affairs responsible for the management of the State, for a report on the supplementary pension contribution received by the CEO of the airline Pekka Vuramo, Yle says.
According to the Minister, it is incompatible with the state's will.
The additional pension of EUR 130 000 received by Varuramo was raised this week when Helsingin Sanomat reported on the development of the remuneration of the directors of listed companies.
The Finnish Picture magazine reported on Vauramo’s supplementary pension in February.
Finnair said that she would give up supplementary pensions in 2013.
The state has arranged not to use supplementary pensions to pay.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year's ownership decision.
The sanctions got tougher and harder.
Some time ago, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia are on their way from cold to warm.
At the G20 meeting in Hamburg, U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin seemed to be a great match for each other.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions adopted by the US Congress last week and signed by Trump were counterproductive in Russia.
The most striking answer has so far been from Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, according to which the refugee cell signed by Trump means a 'full trade war'.
Even if the Russian reactions were only a sign of political rhetoric and overdosage, the fact that the U.S./Russia was tightened up is a fact after the autumn month following the election of a short Trump.
In the United States, the passing of the sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea was not simple.
Although the Congress adopted the law with considerable unanimity, it was said that the adoption of the law was much more difficult for the President.
The Trump criticises the law he signed recently as "a significant defect".
The reason for President Trump's boxing must have been Russia in particular, although the adoption of a law restricting his own rights must also have been hostile.
As is well known, Russia's possible involvement in the presidential elections and the Trump campaign's Russian connections are being investigated in the United States.
The tightening between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon.
The fact that the White House staff has changed and that various scandalous turns have almost been revealed to be up to date, it seems increasingly obvious that foreign policy is not being conducted in the United States under the leadership of the President, but despite the President.
Such a situation is in no way desirable.
If Russia is a kimurat in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union's core region is tightening up relations in the Baltic Sea.
The EU has visibly expressed the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and has called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained at least coherent on the main aspects of its policy in Russia, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a Member State that trades a lot with Russia such as Finland, financial sanctions have been a real problem.
The effects of the recent US sanctions law are still unclear.
In the EU, it is feared that sanctions will make the operation of many European companies more difficult.
In Finland, effects can be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennovoima nuclear power plant project.
In Europe, acidity has been caused by the exclusion of, for example, liquid natural gas, which is important for the US economy.
Trade sanctions are a means of showing abuse in world politics.
However, economic sanctions must be well-considered and precise.
Otherwise, they will easily harm you more than they do.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
The Trump White House now has its most targeted statue of Freedom
The lack of a statue is certainly a sign of a change of power.
The Americans know it as well as others: the Iraqis, together with the American soldiers, destroyed Saddam Hussein's statue in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideologies of the Trump regime, well knew what was going on in the heated debate with the CNN channel Jim Acosta. The statue of freedom was attacked by Miller in the fight for the President's proposal to reduce legal immigration considerably.
Miller didn't exactly criticise the statue himself.
If he had done so, he would have attacked huge flocks of cruisers and figures that imitate the statue of Liberty.
His attack was aimed at the significance of the statue, and in particular at adding Emma Lazarus’ poem to her feet in 1903 — 17 years after the statue was completed.
So Miller set Acosta up: "I don't want to go into that more detail in history now, but the statue of Liberty is... a symbol of the American freedom that illuminates the whole world.
The poem was later added and is not part of the original statue of Liberty."
Miller was not in fact wrong, but it is not just about history, as he himself said.
The key are the touching words of Lazarus, the only quality in which the state not only invites immigrants but "the poorest of the poor": "You know, your por, / Your huddled masses yearning to break free, / The wretched reflection of your theme location."
The poem is more current than ever.
He made it clear that "the poorest of the poor" are not welcome to the United States of Trump.
The importance of the freedom statue is part of the broader political and cultural debate on the importance of the United States.
After his death, Lazarus’s friends campaigned for the poem to be attached to the statue. They well knew that the act was highly political.
The purpose of the statue was to express the links between French and American Republicanism by a classic symbol, the female incarnation of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, the female character is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the deported mother.
The addition of the poem to the image was a brilliant feministic coup d'état and a devastating attack on the American principle of nationality.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to turn it back into the original.
Rush Limbaugh, now a kind of prophecy about Trump, claimed in 2010 that the statue of Liberty is not to be invited to anyone, but is the early forerunner of neoconservatives that takes the U.S. torch to cover the darkness in the world: "Lady Liberty is coming out.
He takes freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The call doesn't show the way to the United States."
Very rarely, Limbaugh was partly right.
The importance of the freedom statue depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazarus saw it as poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the ship’s deck after a long and trying journey.
He saw it from the point of view of people looking for a better life.
His statue of Liberty is comforting by giving hope and welcome.
And that's not what Miller and Trump want.
Their torch doesn't look like the way, it's burning the flames of anger, their only source of power.
World Cup of Sports 2017: Neil Black honors the Scottish members of the UK national team
Eilith Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots got to the British national team.
Neil Black, Executive Director of the British League for Sports, says that 16 Scottish members of the World Cup will be "remarkably confirmed".
A record number of Scottish athletes has been selected for the World Cup of Sports in London on Friday.
According to Black, "there is something special going on in Scotland", from which British sports must learn.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to study it for so long that we understand what it is," says Black.
"I was in the middle with representatives from the Scottish Sports Institute, and they thought it had something to do with the Institute's activities.
The Scottish League of Sports believes that it is related to the activities of the Union,
and the British Federation for Sports believes that it is behind their action.
And the usual street guy thinks he's got something to do with it.
It is, however, a great thing, for whatever it is."
Many Scottish athletes in London are seriously competing for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in a 5,000-metre run. Eilith Doyle was elected captain of the national team.
"Eilith is too modest.
His captain's speech was incredible," Black says.
"The athletes left the opportunity proud of their achievements and strongly motivated, regardless of where they would live and practice.
Eilith's words contained genuine emotion and passion for sports."
Eilith Doyle is the silver medalist of the National Community Championships in a 400-metre fence race, and these are his fifth World Championship, and he thinks that there are 16 Scots on the national team.
The previous record was in the seven years 1983 and 2015.
The mid-distance runner Laura Muir has run five British and two European records during the year.
He's competing in London for 1 500 meters and 5 000 meters.
Chris O'Hare runs 1 500 meters in London. He too should be kept in mind: the man has an excellent period behind him, which includes winnings in the United Kingdom's MMs and the Anniversary Games competition.
Doyle remembers her first World Championship, when the only Scotsman on the national team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he's "supervised" to be involved in so many Scots, some of whom are seriously competing for the finals and medals.
"Accomplishment is a great honour anyway, but it is even more extraordinary because the members of the national team voted for the captain," Doyle says.
"I am, of course, very proud of all the Scots who made it to the national team.
It shows how far we've come.
They are part of a well-deserved athletes who compete for prizes.
My Captain's speech?
I thought it was all right.
I was focused on how lucky we are when we have the home shows.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home audience and the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get another chance to compete there, and I know that the atmosphere is going to be amazing."
Preventing critics on Facebook: Do not run for public office if you cannot endure criticism
Our country's father knew what bad publicity was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticize him for all the politics he could have in his home country.
I'm sure the criticism was annoying.
But he didn't silence his critics.
"If freedom of speech is removed, we may be led stupid and quiet as sheep for slaughter," said Washington in 1783.
That's how we get to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan’s staff have removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and prevented their performers.
The U.S. Civil Rights Association sued Hogan earlier this week.
His staff considered the challenge unfounded, and his attitude was also negligible online.
"What difference? This is just Facebook," many comments.
But it does matter.
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is the amazingly popular Republican governor of the democratic state.
He's got the second best estimate of his activities among the 50 governors.
Hogan's not sensitive to a hottie.
He has led the state firmly and strictly adhered to the principles.
He has also used Facebook as the main channel of communication for his voters and published a picture of his baldness in chemotherapy.
Therefore, preventing users from entering the Governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The Governor's page is a public and official forum maintained by his staff with tax resources.
Hogan's informant, Amelia Chase, defended the governor's actions in his interview with the Washington Post, and he said it was only about moderating the comments.
However, it is too easy to label commentators as trolls, sprayers or haters.
Washington Post interviewed users on Hogan's Facebook.
They proved to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to the leaders they chose, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs, and pastors.
They told us that their comments were respectful, kind, and practical.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his comments; he wanted to appeal to the Catholic faith of Hogan.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Maryland's Bowie was not hostile, but asked a question about hate crimes.
"I was politely disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news," he wrote in the comments from Washington Post.
"I also cannot accept that, when more people comment on the same thing, they are immediately seen as an organised group and are ignored as a large group of concerned citizens."
The Governor's staff called comments "a focused attack." Someone else could call them "the most important thing to promote."
During the Facebook era, communication is easy to control by preventing a critic or removing a critical comment.
In the past, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical headlines, or to arrest and silence protestors.
But it is really the same thing, and now it is only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public authority to be accused of connecting Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users blocked by President Trump have been suing him.
A first important decision was taken last week in Virginia.
According to Alexandria’s district court judge James C. Caberis, the Loudoun County government violated the first addition of the U.S. Constitution in preventing voters from being on Facebook.
And the U.S. Society of Civil Rights visited with Matt Bevin, the Republican Governor of Kentucky, on Twitter and Facebook.
This shouldn't be difficult.
At the time of Washington, low - cost postal charges had a similar effect to the Internet today.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers embroiled Washington.
There were trolls back then.
The titles Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius wrote in the newspapers letters calling out Washington’s decisions.
The President's office received petitions to criticise the Jay Agreement, the US-British Cooperation, Trade and Maritime Agreement, which is reflected in the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington network project.
But he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are fundamental stones for our nation.
True leadership means acceptance of this fact.
We need to stop the bird's summer food right away.
Samples have come from about half a place, and also from a couple of online notices, three.
Most of them have become South and South Finland, but then individual ones from Haapavesi and Seinäjoki, specialist researcher Marja Isomursu from Evira.
The green beets have died of a parasite called tricomonosis.
It is caused by an animal known as Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to hit pigeons, especially the dove.
In the 21st century, however, the disease was also detected in the trophies.
In 2009, it was a very good year.
That was when tricomonosis caused a major collapse in Finland's green beet stock, after which the stock of the species has been recovering.
There have been sick green beets now, but at least not yet on a large scale, says Juha Honkala, Museum of Natural Science of the University of Helsinki (Luomus).
It can be feared that the previous epidemic of the green wings will be repeated again unless something is done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that can be done by everyone: stop the summer food of birds immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from a home-field advantage at the Renaissance Club
Ronan Rafferty, former European Number One player, hopes to benefit from the homefield advantage for the next three days, while the Renaissance Club in East Lothian organises the 25th Scottish Senior Open tournament.
Last year, Rafferty, Northern Ireland, led a tournament in the Archerfield Links field next door before the last round, but finally lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty has become a fan of a new place and is the winner of the tournament on behalf of the founder of the club and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
"I followed the building of the Renaissance Club, and with this event it will be filled with glory," Rafferty says.
"The players see the field at their best. It's in great condition.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He's an enthusiastic ambassador to the game, and he's proud of his accomplishments here.
The tournament is a great show-up event for this field."
For the first time, English Eales defends the championship, despite winning the 32-year career tour of both Europe and Europe's challenge tour.
"This feels like a very special opportunity," says the player in Southport.
"I was unable to defend my victory at Extremedura Open because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It's wonderful to come back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back to mind: the tournament victory was great for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time that we'll always remember."
Gary Orr returns to reality on his own soil, and he went on the tour after 50 years earlier this year.
This is his first performance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
"Playing in the home area is always more important", says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
"You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again, and I've played pretty hard.
I'm happy with my game so far."
The three will be followed by Ian Woosnam, the former Masters winner, and the senion Major winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournament is attended by six Scots: Orr and former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrance and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
You have free access to the tournament. Car parking costs five pounds if you only have a driver and ten pounds if you have at least two people in the car.

The cot was able to figure out the potential air problems in the carcase.
At least no internal air problems have been found in the cocoon of the Pori Brigade's communication company, which was reported on Thursday.
Further in-air studies will be carried out.
The investigation began when the man who stopped his military service for health reasons thought that his health was weakened by bad indoor air.
According to Colonel Mika Holman, Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, there have been no problems with the health situation of other guards.
It turned out that this was an isolated case, and no other service in that unit had any health problems.
Each announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to clarify this point thoroughly.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any internal air problem, says Holma.
The Brigade’s announcement states that due to the arrival of July, it was necessary to transfer goods to the cashiers, which may have led to a temporary increase in dust.
That's why the air may have seemed so clumsy, Holma says.
Poverty and death in Indonesia’s goldland
Bardina Degei doesn't use the gentleness of her cooking.
He's only rarely using a cat, too.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Panaman region, located in the restless province of Papua. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts the Battalion – locally "see" – directly to his fire.
In half an hour, the sweet potatoes burned to the curree will be eaten with an unwashed, unwashed hand.
Dege's home has no furniture, and he sits in a muddy underground, where he usually takes care of his daily appliances, such as laundry in the velvet water that is applied for from the nearby swamp.
The office of the toilet will be delivered by a bucket in the roofless room.
Degei is the youngest of the four wives of his husband, and he has not been assigned to care for the fields.
It's a very common place to get married.
Late work can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed, and many drink a lot. In addition, it is necessary to take into account soldiers.
"No one dares walk in the village after five nights," says Degei.
This is a rare tickle in the highlands of Papua, in the former Dutch colony, which was connected to Indonesia in 1969. The connection was preceded by a controversial referendum, where the price of the village was forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement that opposed the Dutch power quickly turned its hatred over to the Jakarta Government, which holds the area tightly under control and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from entering it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua New Guinea and Western Papua New Guinea.
The Enarotal is remote and a hole. The journey begins on a one and a half hour flight from the main city of the province to Nabire and continues on a five-hour drive from the city of Jayapur to the city of Nabire.
There's no public transport here.
There are wood houses surrounded by Bamboo Gardens, some 19 000 inhabitants of the city, the rust of which has been dyed into clockbrowns.
Only a few Indonesians have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the Christian missionaries came, the Papua Mee Pago tribes worshiped the god Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We didn't have clothes like this," says Degei. He means his colorful, hand-woven thread head, dark skirt and brightly colored shirt.
"Fore we had only leaves covered with our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of its inhabitants living below the poverty line, and child mortality and illiteracy are the highest in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's goldland.
Pania is the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, owned by Freeport McMoran, based in Phoenix, USA.
In 2015, the mine produced $3.1 billion in gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, Papua has an estimated 78 billion dollars of wood reserves.
However, these riches bring misery to the Papuans, for they mean the repressive presence of a strong army in Indonesia.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid nearly 20 million dollars to local military staff and military local units between 1998 and 2004.
This source of income is threatened by the demands of the beans for greater self - determination, and they will be silently silenced.
According to human rights activists, the Indonesian army has killed more than 500 000 parrots and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands since 1969.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass deaths in the highlands of the Papuase tribes in the 1970s were the proportions of genocide.
Last year more than 3,900 people were arrested by the Indonesian police in peaceful demonstrations.
We Will Lose Everything in 2016 reports on the cruelty of the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture – rapes and electric shocks are particularly popular – and unsadulterated attacks towards peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because there are cases weekly," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Ruuma has been tightened when the natural resources of Papua attract migrants from elsewhere in Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants in the province, 83 percent are Christians, but the population structure is changing as the population from the popular Jaava, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawes islands in Indonesia moves to the region in the hope of better living.
Javaswarung-food stores sell fried chicken and gado-gado vegetable blend in peanut sauce.
It's hard for the locals to compete.
"The changers have started selling chicken and vegetables in the market cheaper than the locals," says Abeth You, a 24-year-old, who is from Pania and moved to the province's capital after work.
"The local women lost their clients."
In his 2014 election campaign, the Indonesian President, Mr Widodo, promised to tackle the injustice and violations of human rights in Papua.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 regions, including Panama, on his way to Jakarta Presidential Castle.
But only a little has changed with Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 and we waited for him to fulfill our hope and restore justice", says You.
In Panama, some kind of wave base was experienced only two months after the Yokow locusts took office.
11 children were singing Christmas songs near the fire at Enarotal on 7 December 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared out of the dark on motorcycles.
Scared children told soldiers that they should use driving lights.
According to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to the reports of the victims and witnesses, drunk soldiers captured the children and assaulted them with rifles.
That's how one soldier shot at the kids.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, went into a coma as a result of assault.
A few hours later, the building of the National Electoral Council near the venue was set on fire, and the next day began.
About a thousand parrots — young men and women and children — gathered at the football field before the local police station and the military headquarters of command to demand justice.
They were accompanied by hunting strings for the holiday, and they began to perform the traditional waita dance of the Papua Mee Pago family, where they dance around and follow the song of the bird.
Some protestors began to stone police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere got hot, the soldiers received an order in the internal radio system: "If the crowds resist more than three times, shoot them to death." The information is based on an official document published in the TIME magazine, which has not been published in the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, head of the Kego Koto region, suspected that the situation would get out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot on the left wrist," he told the TIME magazine with his brightly painted wooden house on the porch.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the soldiers' ranks.
"There were several shots fired at the intruder."
Alfius Youwi was shot three times, his cousin saw the shootings.
"I ran to him, and I made sure it was him," said Yohanes TIME, sad. Like many Indonesians, he only uses one name.
"I saw that he was dead... "I kissed him."
The P.A.P.A. Inspector Yotje Mende told journalists that the police only "protected" the police station because it was under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Papua police informant Pudjo Sulistio in 2015.
"That's when it comes to life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protestors were killed and many were injured.
The next day, knowledge of the deaths took place in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapur, where he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised to deal with the violence in Papua.
"I want the case investigated immediately so that nothing like that ever happens again."
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that he would launch reports of human rights violations outside the judicial system.
But he started to cancel his speech right away.
"The biggest part of the violations happened a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate infringements, but it requires certain processes," he said.
In an interview in Jakarta on 5.6.2017 Wiranto had already changed his mind.
"It's all settled in court," he told me.
The UN accuses Wiranto of "criminal humanity". The crimes relate to the death of more than a thousand people in the blood of East Timor in 1999. Wiranto told TIME that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been investigated, including the events in Pania.
The families of the victims of Pania have a gloomy disbelief of the claims.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way," says Yohanes.
"I'm already tired of this."
He tells us he's still living in fear, even though it's been years.
"Yes, I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, and I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panics are afraid to discuss the event.
He says that the soldiers had assaulted him when he had helped bury four victims.
"The soldiers are looking for me after burying the victims," he says.
The gunmen aren't over.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighbouring region of Pania in Deiya.
One died and 17 were injured in a conflict between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, which started when the director refused to take the man who had lost consciousness to the hospital. Among the injured were children.
The man who needed medical care was 24-year-old Ravinus Douw, who had been on water when fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
In front of the company’s office, the angry villagers expressed their views on the construction site.
According to the police, the villagers stoned policemen who responded with warning shots.
According to the locals, however, a police force moving from Indonesia’s paramilitary police opened fire toward the crowd, when one villager was killed.
"We're terrified, we're afraid of revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being brought in for treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the shooting of police officers to be held accountable and the withdrawal of the mobile police force from the area.
Pania has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development feeds dissatisfaction with the Mee, Mon, Dani and Damal tribes, who live in the wheaty Middle East of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Release Movement (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to defend the rights of the papal by occasional attacks and the kidnapping of the Indonesian army soldiers.
Some OPM leaders are from Panama, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arbitraryly arresting and arresting thousands of people in Panama in the name of "the protection of national sovereignty".
Some of the arrested will never come back.
Among the peacocks, Pania is known as a sad, forgotten place.
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
There is only a small amount of rice in Enarotal for sale, and that too is too expensive for the locals,
Just like the bread.
People grow their food themselves: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leaf vegetables.
Farming is women's work, and one woman's responsibility may be four or five potato fields.
Most of the crops are for the family, and the rest are sold on the market.
Ten sweets cost only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, disparities in the livelihood of local and migrants have increased and the number of migrants has increased since new routes were opened at Nabire airport.
There are few jobs, and they usually go to better-trained and more wealthy migrants than locals.
Only a few of them have enough capital and know-how to run their own business competitively.
"Young people don't want to stay here because there's no work and no money," says John Gobai, President of the Pannian tribe council.
The world remains a little obsessively obsessive Papua.
In addition, restrictions on international news are still strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua, although they had been granted a rare permit to describe, and the official cause was the inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to the Asian Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Phelim Kine, Jokowi has not kept his electoral promises, and he has not increased transparency and has not promoted development by removing the restrictions on news.
"The suppliers newsing about the most troubled provinces in Indonesia from Papua and Western Papua have new risks: visa refusal and blacklisting," Kine said in her opinion.
The lack of freedom of action in the press means that the Indonesian government is under pressure only by the neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "numbers and widespread violations" of Papua, including the Pania shooting scene.
These countries have also traditionally supported the release movement for Papua.
Arrmanatha Nasir, informant of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, denied the accusations and told journalists in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so covering evidence of human rights violations would be difficult".
Locals want the governments of the foreign states to intervene.
When the Dutch official delegation led by the Commissioner for Human Rights, Kees Van Bar, visited Jayapur on 4.5.2017, the locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, says the anonymous source of the meeting.
There are Presidential elections in Indonesia 2019, but the Papuaans tell us that they are no longer likely to vote for Jokowi.
"One means good, but there are people around him who have been involved in the Pania shooting scene," says Gobai, President of the tribe council.
He wants Jokowin to know the situation of the panicous: they live under the control of a greedy and unpredictable army in poverty and poverty, virtually without health services and training opportunities.
According to Gobai, the Panics, like the other parrots, keep the voices they give to Jokow as a "debt" that must be repaid.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shooting at Pania once again demonstrated resistance in a symbolic way: they buried one of the victims in the opposite country of the police station and the military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed," says Yacobus in the head.
"What else can we do?"
Derek Chisora says about canceling Robert Helenius' rematchion: "Even your own fans don't want to see"
Robert Helenius and Derek Chisoran, the heavy boxers, were supposed to fight in Hartwall Arena on 27 May.
However, the fight withdrew for commercial reasons.
Chisora, in her recent interview with IFL TV, is the reason why the rematching match is completely on Helenius' shoulders.
My fight in Finland failed, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
It was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he sucks, Chisora bored.
Helenius and Chisora first met in a full Hartwall arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial point judge.
The ticket sales of the re-election match went smoothly, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanom in May that the match had been moved to autumn.
There's nothing new about fighting since then.
However, the withdrawal will no longer harm Chisora.
In any case, the fight would probably have had to be reversed after Chisora was ill.
Thursday, three days before the time of the match, I woke up in a lot of pain.
My belt was about to explode.
The hospital said I had to be cut, Chisora says.
At the moment, Britti says he's in about 45% condition.
He's not interested in rematching Helenius, he's targeting Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a loss to Whyte in December with a split voice.
The fire took over the Torch Cloud Drawer in Dubai for the second time.
The flames took over the world's highest-numbered residential building in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of residents were forced to flee 337 meters from a high 79-storey building.
This was already another fire within two years of the building, whose name happens to be a Torr, a torch.
The building was emptied, and no one knows it was injured, and there was no idea of the fire right after the event.
"We were asleep and woke up with a fire alarm and people yelling.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took ten minutes," the resident named George told Reuters.
According to Dubai’s rescue services, firepowers were turned off at four o’clock in the morning by local time and remained cooling the building.
The government announced that it would arrange accommodation for those who left it.
The case may again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the outer surfaces of high buildings around the world.
After the fire in 2015, the board of directors of the Torr building carried out a study which found that the most victims of the damage were the sheets used for covering and insulating the façade.
In Great Britain, the police believe that London's Gren Fell Tower's insulation and curtaining records may have contributed to the rapid progress of flames in a fire where 80 people died in June.

In the United States, more than 20% of air passengers include prohibited items, reveals survey
A survey conducted by air passengers reveals that more than 20 % of passengers in the United States had deliberately or unconsciously exported prohibited items to planes past the inspection points of the U.S. Road Safety Agency (TSA). At least 6 % of passengers had knives or other articles with steel which they did not know were prohibited.
Less than one percent reported that they had only learned afterwards that they had been carrying weapons, ammunition, or explosives in error.
More than a thousand passengers responded to the questionnaire and was carried out by stratos Jet Charters, and the results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to challenge the rules than others.
19.7 per cent of passengers knowingly having broken TSA rules were representatives of the Y-generation and less than 15 per cent were members of the X-generation.
Most commonly, the rules were broken by taking food and liquids to the plane.
In addition, 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men reportedly taking prohibited drugs onto the plane.
The survey involved passengers from all over the United States. The company that carried out the survey wanted to find out how many had accidentally taken over the smuggling goods and how many had done so knowingly.
It is not surprising that the most travellers are also most likely to pass a security check — consciously or unconsciously.
However, as the company that did the survey notes, TSA's instructions are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids can be taken to the plane and how much.
It is therefore no surprise that most of the TSA's seized are liquids.
For some time there was also the feeling that books should not be taken to the plane.
You can take fluids on domestic flights, but not international flights.
Scott Pruitt, Director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, passed his decision to delay the decisions taken during Obama's period to reduce emissions
The day after 15 states had been sued by Scott Pruitt, Director of EPA, by the US Environmental Protection Agency, Pruitt withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of the smoke reduction decisions taken during Obama’s reign.
According to Pruitt, the change shows that the agency he has led takes better account of the needs of environmental decision-makers in the states.
Mrs Pruitt did not mention with a word the action against her earlier decision before the Federal Court of Appeal.
States should start to comply with the 2015 ground ozone standard as of 1.10.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would move the implementation of the decisions forward for a year so that his agency would have more time to get to know the plan, because the Agency 'do not want to intervene in local decision-making or undermine economic growth'.
Pruitt was General Public Prosecutor of the state of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him Head of the EPA.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions against the chemical industry and the fossil fuels industries.
Wednesday’s sudden change of mind is the latest setback on Pruitt’s plan to mitigate the provisions.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington adopted a decision that the head of the EPA exceeded his mandate to try to delay the implementation of the Obama decision on oil and gas companies, which obliged the companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In its opinion on Wednesday evening, Pruitt claimed that his full translation of the ozone regulations would only strengthen EPA cooperation with the States in a complex process aimed at meeting new requirements in accordance with the timetable.
"In the past, EPA often failed to comply with deadlines and then expected activist groups and others to challenge the court in which the agreement was reached on timetables", Pruitt said. In his previous action, he appealed to the environmental agency's court more than ten times.
"We do not believe in judicial regulation and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and the mandates it has given us."
However, the EPA opinion noted that Pruitt could continue to use its "responsible powers to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers" in order to ensure that the provisions "are justified and based on the best available information".
The Republicans are driving a wider change of ozone regulations in Congress.
The aim of the legislative initiative adopted last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
Eric Schneiderman, the General Prosecutor of the state of New York, who has been sued by the EPA in court this week, said that the group is going to continue to pressurise.
"EPA's change of mind as a result of our actions is a significant victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who are exposed to the direct effects of smoke in their communities," Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the application included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia.
The ozone of the ground is produced when emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants, for example, react in the atmosphere to sunlight.
This can cause severe breathing difficulties for vulnerable groups of people, which is also part of thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists were delighted by the unexpected change in Pruitt’s direction.
"It is worrying how much pressure was required to get the guy responsible for our breath to use healthy sense," says Lori Ann Burd of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the Trump regime, as its ideological objective is to act on the terms of polluters and other groups that have their own interests."
From the supercar manufacturer, there's a street SUV that's going to happen in Ferrari style.
It also intends to make a contribution to hybrid sports cars while trying to maintain its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will be in Ferrari style, said CEO Sergio Marchionne at the information meeting on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer presents its new five-year plan, the Automative News news will be announced.
All Cinderella cases in Eastern Savo of the same virus type
The infection with the Cinderella virus is the same as in the previous cases of East Savo, to inform THL.
The virology laboratory of the health and well-being establishment has ensured on Thursday that the fifth infection of East Savo is the same as that of previous infections.
THL has ensured that on Friday, July 28, a coastal salaried person has the same virus type as the previous case of East Savo.
On the basis of this information, all infections found in East Savo are linked to the first ashtray found in the area in June.
The news is good, because it means that we have not come up with any other types of CW virus.
However, it is possible that new infections may be present from the fifth patient until mid-August, and the epidemic is not yet over, says Mirkaleena Erkkilä, the doctor responsible for Soster's primary health disease.
There have been no new outbreaks or suspicions since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important for everyone to take care of the timeliness of their own vaccination, Erkkilä reminds us.
More on the subject: Three new outbreaks of CSF in Pirkanmaa were confirmed - "An additional infection or epidemic is very unlikely"
Finland is preparing to make an acceptable cry
The Pontic soup was not even considered to be legalized.
In the background, the process produces a methanol that is toxic in addition to alcohol.
Preparation of a scream at home will be legal next year, but it is not even possible to consider legalising a pontico soup.
The scream is made by rolling, and the spot is distilled again.
The reason behind the regulation of distillation is that the process, alongside the wine, produces methanol, which is toxic.
There has been no political will to make the pontico soup every man's right, and Ismo Ismo Tuminen, Government Councilman, commented on the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the Ministry prepared the reform of the alcohol law, the distillation of the pomegranate was not considered legal.
It was also not brought to the political table.
There was no debate on the liberalisation of distillation, says Congressman Outi Mäkelä.
He is a member of the negotiating group of the parliamentary groups of the government parties who took a position on the reform of the alcohol law.
The promise to distill a point at home will not even be granted on the application.
Commercial production will also remain subject to authorisation.
The introduction states that the home production of alcoholic beverages is subject to a simple rule: alcohol is allowed to be produced at home by way of visits.
This means that now, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can legally scream at home.
The government has wanted to simplify the rules.
The new law removes the requirements of flavouring and flavouring substances and allows for the preparation of the shield, Mäkelä specifies.
The manufacture must still be carried out in such a way that the raw materials or flavourings resulting from their use are clearly visible.
Under the new law, you can make as much drinks as you like, and self - made alcohol can be given as a gift.
You still can't put it in sales.
Doing this is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Thomas believes.
A much larger change occurred in 2004, when imports of passengers from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of the alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The draft law on alcohol is now under review by the Ministry of Justice.
The alcohol law will come to Parliament as soon as the autumn season begins.
The plenary session was held on 5.9.
The Act will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if the Parliament had already taken a stand, Mäkela rejoices.
Oscar Pistorius was escorted to the hospital by armed guards.
Oscar Pistorius, suffering from chest pain, was rushed to a South African hospital because of a heart attack.
Pistorius is already out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius suffers from his prison sentence in Atteridgeville Prison.
According to British Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison to the hospital this morning by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pain, but he got out of the hospital this afternoon.
The informant of the prison confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for investigations.
On the other hand, the informant of the Pistorius family told us that the former top athlete is fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced a six-time Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Stenkamp in February 2013.
Littered telephone conversations reveal Trump's pressure on Mexico to build a border wall.
The literation of telephone conversations between the U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia has been leaked to Washington Post.
On 27 January 2017, Trump called on the Mexican President, Enrique Peña Nieto, to put an end to his public talk that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States called Nieto that he had knocked the wall project in public. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential election campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
Washington Post also published a flattering for Trump's first call to the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. During the call, there was an intense exchange of views.
Trump said to Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take refugees on its way to Australia is 'murderful', 'sad' and 'stupid'. According to Trump, the agreement negotiated during Obama would make him look like an idiot' because he had proposed a ban on the residence of refugees in the United States.
Trump stopped by saying to Turnbull that this was the most unpleasant call of all day.
Georgian massacre: Activists re-enacted racist lynching in the hope of justice
The Ford Mercury car passes a crowd in Monroe's small town in the Georgian countryside and continues its journey towards a small Moore's Ford bridge.
There are four black passengers and a white driver, four armed men blocking the road before the car gets to the bridge.
The leader of the team, a middle-aged man dressed in a striped suit, takes a deep breath of his cigar and he's going through the windshield.
Passengers are scared.
"Roger, n--u!" he's screaming.
"Get out of the car!"
The screams break the silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is just a resurrection, which was presented on 22 July 2017.
However, the pores of shock are genuine when the hanger eye is wrapped in the neck of Roger.
Since 2005, human rights organisations have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to re-enact the events of 1946. At that time Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one's been charged with murder.
"It is confusing that no one has been arrested during these years – although murderers live among us and many must know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who will help with the re-enactment arrangements.
"It's a shame of history, but above all, it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgian Congressman.
He must be startled by the resurrection, and it also reminds the people of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want those who are guilty to go to trial, and we want things to be finally concluded, and we want to get out of sorrow and make peace, but above all, we want justice," Brooks says.
"We can't recover and make peace until we have justice."
The coroner covers the body of the victim who died in Georgia's massacre on 27.7.46.
According to NBC news, over 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding districts were suspected of lynching.
But no one was charged with murder.
Although the perpetrators have been free for decades, activists have always been aware of the motives of lynching: politics and sex.
In 1946, black people in Georgia had the highest right to vote in the presidential elections for the first time, and the Supreme Court decided in April, and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, an incident occurred at the time of the election involving a black tenant Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, in a fight apparently involving Malcom's wife, Dorothy.
According to Brooks, the city was told that Hester had an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was pregnant with this child.
According to FBI records, the influential white landowner, Loy Harrison, paid Malcom $600 in guarantees against which he was released from prison on 25.7.46.
On their way home, Malcom and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The mob stopped their cars before the Moore's Ford bridge.
"It turns out Harrison ordered and arranged the murders," states the FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local authorities. The authorities were involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks is more specific.
"It was a right-wing murder," he says.
"They were murdered because they were wanted to communicate to the black people "that they would do the same if they were to vote."
Cassandra Greene has been directing Georgia's massacre for almost a decade.
The presentation is extremely realistic and imprisonable, and it is a description of shocking racism, which many would like to believe has already disappeared from the United States of America.
It's hard to watch a show, but it's even harder not to see what Greene says it's meant to be.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because we have to face our own dark sides," says the director.
"But I can't have a relationship with you if you can't hear me or you don't want to hear what I've been through."
This year’s performances began in June. On the first day about 30 actors — tens of blacks and 20 whites — gathered to listen to Greene’s routine summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh acts as Greene's assistant director.
He has been presenting the local leader of Ku Klux Klan for years, but the role is always as difficult and hostile.
"I'm gonna feel dirty 'cause I'm not myself," Marbaugh says.
"It is, however, important that this side of history be kept on the table, so that it will never again."
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona train Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The show starts with a scene where Malcom yells and pushes Hester, and he's upset that Hester has had an affair with Dorothy.
"Don't you hear me?
Rascona, Hester.
And then we're gonna take a hit.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) burst into a laugh.
Greene laughs the most.
"What?" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally hit too hard?" he asks.
"No", Greene's on fire.
"I just don't think the whites used the word n--u."
"Yes," the other black actor confirms.
"It's a slang, you need to use a longer version."
The subject of the performance is unpleasant, but the room's power is a friend's spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just because of the show, but because they want to respect the memory of those who died.
The scene starts from the beginning.
Now Rascona's words are true.
No one's laughing.
The revival will end quickly and violently.
Crying, shooting — and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral dress stands next to the bodies and sings Billie Holiday Strange Fruit.
His voice is broken for every other word.
A few ten metres away, fifty viewers wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
Almost half of the audience are black and half white.
There's a couple in this group who's come to see Ithaca's show from the state of New York, but most of it's local.
They've been on Brooks' guidance to the victims' graves in Georgia's pressurized humidity.
The murders have turned from story to story, and the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the song, Greene invites a crowd to check the bodies.
Children cry out to look at artificial blood and immobilised bodies and whisper at each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy mutes like to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
Actors who present the lynchists take off their capes and wipe out tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then breaks into tears after a hard show.
"Don't worry," the woman in the show is comforting.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason."
Later, the audience and actors will meet for a joint dinner.
The white couple from Altanta are busy discussing the performance with the black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski is hard to find when she describes the feelings of the performance.
"It's hard to listen to terrible words and watch terrible acts that say and do people who look the same as you – precisely because they look the same as you," he says.
"My performance made me realize that lynchies are still happening," he added. "They're just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for those at the same table.
He says he's already started planning next year's performance.
"Resurrection is a strong experience because it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it is also a teaching experience," Brooks says.
"The message is that this can happen again if we do not learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it."
The scrapping of plants in the shops is really saving: To this extent, by removing "excess parts"
Is it allowed to remove the leaves of the cauliflower already in the store before weighing?
And take out the big part of the pineapple... that weighs a lot of weight, right?
The answers share views strongly: for one, it is a sign of extreme nodule, while for the other, it does not want to pay for those parts of the vegetables that are not used and which, however, go to the trash at home.
We'll identify the phenomenon in the stores.
For example, the K-Citymarket vegetable department in the Ruoholahti region of Helsinki has cartons of cardboard, because many rip off, for example, the leaves of the cauliflower.
From the box, the leaves are being exported to bio-waste.
According to the news published by the economic messages, snooping on the vegetable counter is amazing for traders.
But how much does the removal of the extra parts of the vegetables before weighing really save money?
How important is it that we really have to sneeze?
We women test how the price changes when they take off the leaves or strains of pineapple, latva artisan, sweet mushrooms, broccoli and cauliflower.
Flowering cabbage: €2.10 was €1.80 when all leaves were peeled out.
Pine: the price of the total pineapple cost of EUR 2,30 fell to EUR 1,95 when its heel turned off.
Latva artisan: EUR 2,60 became EUR 2,40 when the short position was removed.
Sweet mushrooms: Two sweet mushrooms cost a total of 75 cents.
Without the stocks, the price was 60 cents.
Broccoli: The medium-sized broccoli cost 1 euro and without the carry 80 cents.
Final result: If leaves and strains go off, save at best a few ten cents for one vegetable.
Per cent, the price of vegetables decreased by up to 20 per cent.
Thus, a total of EUR 1,20 would have been saved from these purchases!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona - a Brass Star signed a five-year contract with PSG
A five - year agreement has been concluded with the French football club PSG, reports the news agency AFP.
On Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar’s representatives had paid a purchase price of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelona, a football player in the Spanish league.
The transfer amount of EUR 222 million is the largest in the history of football.
In the past, Manchester United had a record that cost EUR 105 million last summer for the French Paul Pogba.
The Spanish league was holding back the transfer earlier on Thursday when it rejected the first payment company of Neymar's representatives.
According to the rules of the league, the buying society cannot pay the buyout price directly to the seller, but the player himself must buy out his contract, which happens by recycling money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and its representatives who delivered the money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is believed to be arriving in Paris on Friday.
He may be introduced to a new home audience in the PSG season opening against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa's looking into the details
In addition, Barcelona reported that it provided information on the payment of the fee to Uefa, the European Football Union, in order to enable the Union to determine any disciplinary action arising from the case.
Among other things, the Spanish President, Javier Tebas, has suspected that PSG will be in breach of Uefa's financial fair play rules.
Uefa can punish a company that will lose more than EUR 30 million over a period of three years.
According to Uefa, Neymar's transfer does not automatically break its financial code.
The transfer of Neymar to PSG has an impact on the company’s economy for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players at significant sums, Uefa was informed.
The PSG is owned by the state-owned Qatarese company Qatar Sports Investment.
The Association is chaired by a former tennis pro, Qatarist Nasser al-Khelaif.
Ten shirts for Neymar
Austin, 21, got a rougher burn from lightning strike... the flash went into the airport security camera.
Austin Dunn was doing normal operations on a plane at the International Airport of Southwest Florida with a couple of workmates when suddenly a lightning hit the plane from the rainy sky.
The power of lightning cast the wing of the plane into the land of Dunn near.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third degree burns all over his body.
My father called me and said he was electrocuted and he's in the hospital.
I was just asking if she was alive, Austin's sister, Autumn, says.
Austin spent two weeks in a hospital.
In addition to the burns, he had muscle damage and he had a bleeding brain.
The experience was hard for the whole family.
You can't wait like that.
It's traumatizing for everyone, Auutumn tells me.
According to the airport representative, the lightning risk warning system was on at the time of the incident and the transport company itself decides whether to comply with it.
Pearson reduces 3 000 jobs and revives business by cutting dividends
The British training group, Pearson, announced on Friday that it would reduce 3 000 jobs and cut the dividend by 72% when starting a new restructuring programme in response to pressures on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, job reductions are made mainly at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019. The company has already reduced 4 000 jobs in connection with previous structural arrangements.
Pearson stated that he would again cut the costs by £300 million in May as part of his third savings programme, aimed at reinvigorating the business that was weakened as a result of the rapid digitalisation process.
Last month Pearson decided to sell his share of the Penguin Random House publishing plant to his partner Bertelsmann. The company announced that it would keep its outlook for the current year. Its net sales increased by one per cent in the first half of the year and was £2.05 billion.
Attack on the victim in Kabul: NATO's soldier died in a suicide attack
The suicide bomber attacked the military embassy in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan. According to the authorities, the attack was killed by NATO's soldier and several others were wounded.
According to NATO's statement, five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local data, three civilians were also killed in the attack on the Kabul Qarabagh area.
The explosion is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month, and on Tuesday, 30 people were killed in an explosion in Herat.
On Monday, two people were killed by a suicide bomber at the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO's statement, Thursday night an explosion occurred when a joint NATO-Afghanistan military patrol was attacked by a "person carrying an artificial explosive".
The opinion stated that all injured persons were stable and treated at the US Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to the exchange of letters, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organisation in Qarabagh are important concerns for NATO troops near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1662 civilians were killed in the first half of 2017, of which 20% were in the capital city.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul, a region where the chiefly lives Shiiamuslims.
He said he was behind the attack.
On the last day of May, in central Kabul, more than 150 people were killed in a bomb attack, which was the country’s most devastating attack on the militant group after the US forces fell from the Taliban power in 2001.
Violence highlights the unstable situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump is considering sending more troops to the United States to help the local army and the police.
According to the correspondence, the suicide attacks in Kabul over the last few weeks have also significantly undermined people's trust in the government, its policy and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghan.
EPA supples its decision to postpone the implementation of smoke fog rules
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rounded up its decision to delay the implementation of decisions under Obama’s regime to reduce smoke emissions on the day after 15 states had brought the Agency to justice.
EPA announced its decision on the implementation of the so-called 'ozone definitions' in 2015 late Wednesday, according to which the decision shows its commitment to cooperation with the states.
"We believe in dialogue and want to respond to the needs of the states," said President Scott Pruitt in the Agency's opinion.
In June, Pruitt announced the Agency’s intention to postpone the implementation of the ozone definitions by one year to October 2018. It is estimated that the smoke level will be measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution reduction is required in accordance with stricter air quality standards.
On Tuesday, the Agency sued 15 states, including the District of Columbia, primarily under the rule of democracy, according to which the postponement of implementation was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has been looking for ways to mitigate the environmental regulations of Barack Obama, which, according to Trump, form part of a wider programme of economic growth.
Trump's measures have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists, who are concerned about the health effects of increasing emissions.
According to the EPA website, inhaling ozone-containing air "may weaken lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, a person of Isis’ leadership had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
It was suspected that the bomb was to be taken to the plane on July 15th, but the company was interrupted before the security check was carried out.
The police won't tell us why the company stopped.
The second plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a toxic non-coloured gas-disposing device and to bring the device into a public place, such as a public transport device.
Australian Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
As a result of the suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interviews continue.
Executive Director of the liquid: Renewable fuels did well
The result of the oil processor's liquid before taxes fell, but struck the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievosen, the company made good results in oil products, sales volumes of renewable products rose to record levels and the development of operating profit in the Marketing & Services segment was in the right direction.
Last year, the US Blenders Tax Credit tax relief improved comparable business profits.
According to Lievos, the operating profit of renewable products remained at a good level this year thanks to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and we will complete the strategic investments we announced earlier in 2017, said Lievonen in the press release.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomashenko will discuss a possible match at their first meeting
Vasyl Lomashenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match in the near future of a series of less than 66.7 kilograms, met each other on Thursday for the first time.
The men were in their own rooms in ESPN sports facilities in Los Angeles until the undefeated WBC light-series champion Mikey Garcia walked down the hall to say hello to Lomashenko, WBO's upper-sleeve.
Garcia won the showtime on Saturday with the unanimous resolution of the former four-weight world champion Adrie Broner. Since then, Garcia and Lomashenko have been among the top five on the list of boxers in different categories.
Garcia put her right hand out and said, "How's it going, master?
Good luck in the fight!"
Lomashenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on the ESPN channel at seven Saturdays.
When the twin posed for photographers, the manager of Lomashenko Egis Klimas pointed out that the match between men would be "perfect in terms of size".
"I'm a former feathersman," Garcia reminded me.
"I've moved higher than [63.5 kg] for the Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm a small six-and-a-half-pound.
I want to go back to the light series.
He has to get into the light series [61,2 kg]. Then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Let's meet their wishes."
Lomashenko agreed.
"Thinking needs this fight."
Klimas asked if a match should be held on the pay channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomashenko that Lomashenko debytook in the light series later this summer and will be fighting next summer against Garcia (37-0, 30 win-wins). Garcia would also be interested to meet the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will be fighting in the light series in Forum on 23 September.
"The fight could be on the payment channel because the fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later announced that she was ready to fight the channel that offers the best prize package.
"We are the most interesting names.
No one else will get as much attention.
I'll be fine with it as soon as we get to the deal."
Garcia said that she appreciated Lomashenko as a "unbelievable fighter" and that she was perhaps going to go to Saturday's game.
Lomashenko interrupted Garcia's compliments and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked "a real slow one. Sorry, Mike... but you needed that knock-off."
Garcia said she was focused on showing the force and then boxing.
The men said that they felt that the fight between them was being desired to be more and more effective.
"This is the fight we're waiting for.
No other match attracts as much attention and interest.
I'm definitely involved in this case," Garcia said.
Lomashenko said he expected to fight the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It's gonna be a great fight."
Average wage 5 300 euros, training whatever happens - the investment advice situation was "crowd and free"
The quality of investment advice has been much more recent.
Last time helsingin Sanomat told Ritva, 68, to whom the banker's investment counsel spoke when selling investment products.
The rules for investment advisers and the sale of various investment products will be tightened up at the beginning of next year.
The reduction will be based on the new Financial Markets Directive, which will apply from the beginning of next year.
At present, the assessment of the know-how of investment advisers and workers selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
There are no competence requirements in the law.
The financial sector (FA) itself recommends that those working in the investment service perform their own APV1 or APV2 degree.
The financial sector has authorised the organisation of qualifications for a company called APV Investment Studies Oy, whose qualification group is composed of experts from financial supervision (Fiva), universities and industry.
The qualifications are 12-15 credits, and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE, the Aalto University Executive Education Oy, which provides business management development services.
Its website says that both exams are generally "very large in terms of requirements".
The educational material of qualifications includes 10-15 books and numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV Investment Studies Oy, reports that the pass rate of exams is roughly 70.
Most of the employees of the largest banks have completed either APV1 or APV2 because they are compulsory according to the company’s own rules.
Then there are smaller bank branches without mentioning the names, whose staff seems to have avoided completing their qualifications, says Savikko.
According to him, there are some of these bank transactions.
According to Saviko, the APV1 degree has completed 13 000-14 000 people since 2000 and some 3 000 people who are more demanding for investment advice.
Some bank branches consider the completion of the qualification to be an advantage.
There are much stricter skills requirements in several other sectors.
Savikko says that the recommendation in the financial sector requires the completion of APV qualifications, because it is then that the expertise in the investment sector will be ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisors make thousands of euros per month on average, including commissions, benefits in kind and performance premiums.
The average monthly working time of employees is approximately EUR 5 300.
On average, men working in jobs earn over EUR 5 900 per month and women over EUR 4,500, respectively.
On average, about 8 100 euros are worth the top ten.
A tenth of the men who make most money earn more than EUR 9 000 per month or more, one in ten earns EUR 6 400 or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act may only be given by a licensed company.
To date, self-regulation has been given confidence at the level of the worker and the task force.
According to Fiva, the audit carried out received individual cases where the professional competence and qualifications of the investor were not sufficient on the basis of the consultant’s activities.
In principle, investment products can also be sold even if skills and qualifications are at a high level.
On the basis of this, the situation has been wild and free.
Several other sectors have much stricter skills requirements, according to Savikko.
According to the Saviko, from the beginning of next year the new Financial Market Directive (MiFID II) will provide for a tightening of this.
This requires each company to be responsible for ensuring that investment services staff are adequately skilled.
On the other hand, financial supervision is given the power to determine what needs to be done.
Fiva Market Inspector Marko Hovi reports that one of the clear changes to the current legislation is the legislation on the skills and experience of investment firms and investment products sellers.
According to the Court, the new requirements concern both the own staff of investment firms and the tied agents who sell products on behalf of a company.
The Court states that according to a government proposal issued by the Ministry of Finance, Fiva is allowed to determine the expertise and experience.
What they are exactly will be decided by these visions during the coming autumn.
The company will also have to continue to provide the necessary training and, if necessary, monitoring and further training.
All this needs to be documented, and the company has a duty to prove that this has also been done.
The court states that, in practice, the company must, for example, identify the staff’s positions at the individual level.
There will certainly be different levels of demand depending on whether it is investment advice or product sales.
According to the Court, there is also a new requirement to work with someone more experienced if knowledge or experience is insufficient.
That is, if the company hires a new employee who does not fully meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person who meets the criteria for a certain period of time.
According to the Court, the change will lead to a tightening of the rules and a concreteisation of the rules.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.

The plane's route was built over the United States in the Flightradar24 service.
The flight was conducted on Thursday 787 with Dreamliner, which Boeing tested the durability of the Rolls Royce engines on a long flight.
The plane departing from Seattle flew for 18 hours and 1 minute for a distance of 15 700 kilometers, which is longer than any regular commercial route in the world.
The flight stayed within the borders of the United States throughout the journey.
It flew a total of 17 states.
Imatra’s persevering beach swimming schools do not be stunned by rain or sun’s birch - Iines Ühkonen’s polski persistently with the help of the bathing village
Even though everything was moving forward at a good pace, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra beach swimming schools run in Liette and Lempuka this week and next week.
Although sometimes it rains and then it boils again, young swimmers are not a mess, Taina Itkonen, the leader of swimming schools, boasts.
This week’s swimming school has a total of 13 children, tens of them next week.
The number of children in the next week was influenced by the fact that the school and the escara were already starting, estimated by Itkonen.
The Imatra Beach Swimming School is organised jointly by the Sports Association project and the City of Imatra.
Thursday, on the Lithuanian beach, there was a nice atmosphere.
The sun shined, and the young swimmers trained to stay on the surface with the swimsuits, someone without it.
The smaller brothers and sisters also enjoyed the water.
Even of everything, 5, first thought of going deeper into the water.
Taina Itkonen, however, encouraged her to kneel toward the beach.
You're doing great!
Even Minden told me he went swimming a lot this summer.
He likes the beach.
As in All things, vili Huhtane, 5.
You too will be pleased with today's achievements, the swimmer praised.
Jami Kallio, 4 again wanted to go to the Water Wars sometime.
Ilona Villberg, who followed her daughter Anna Villberg, followed by 6 swimming on the beach, considers the beach swimming school a good start for swimming.
Even though the weather has been painful, Anna's had a lot of fun going on here every day.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
The swimmers packed on the pier.
The boys had enough trouble with a frog found on the beach.
Milja Luukkanen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread to the pier the towels, snacking fruit and roasting the day.
The water was already teaching, but there was no rush on the pier.
That's not part of the summer.
An unknown soldier sells toilet ridges, "This is a connected story."
You can see it all the way.
The Blue Product, which manufactures cleaning products, launched a series of unknown military products a few days ago.
I mean, dishes and laundryrs, and a toilet brush on the edge of the brush.
An unknown soldier refers to his premiere film and the marketing of the movie this autumn.
However, there is something special in the combination, and the products have been mutilated in social media: When will the unknown health ties come?
I have to call the company and ask what this is about.
What does Vice President Aino Määtt say?
We're a film partner.
We're here to support this movie, like many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film, Määtta says.
According to him, the products will have special features in motion, and the film will thus be made visible.
Isn't there something funny about this - often when you think that products and related stories have something in common?
Yes, there is such a connecting story here that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products, Mättä says.
According to him, the company supports the same basic Finnish values that support those who have seen an old Unknown soldier.
And cleaning's not a stranger to military culture, either, Mätta points out.
Other business partners of the film, such as Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato, are:
To date, for example, Hartwall vichyt has been placed on the market, which is known as Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unknown products have already been followed by a blogger Kalle Kinnunen in Finland
Coffee and watches are already available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the film's first night, so there is still a promise.
Unidentified partners have not yet revealed their war products, for example Valio, Processor, Neste and German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen writes.
New results of the Swedish asylum seekers' age tests were published
The latest results of the Swedish age tests for asylum seekers have been published, but the results of the tests carried out under the new evaluation method reveal that over 80% of those tested were found to be over 18 years old, but not everyone considers the tests reliable.
The Swedish National Law Office started the test earlier this year.
The tests can assess the age of the asylum seeker more closely, and the new test was introduced after criticism of the Swedish Immigration Service for failure to determine the real age of applicants who claimed to be minors.
The Finnish Immigration Service has carried out 6 880 tests so far, and the results of the 2 481 tests have now been published by the Finnish Law Office. The tests were carried out between mid-March and the end of July 2017.
The 80 % tested, i.e. 2002 asylum seeker, was defined as over 18 years of age.
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker was "possiblely less than 18 years old".
Tests were carried out only in cases where there were reasonable grounds for suspecting the age indicated by the applicant.
Johan Göransson, the Office of Laws, says that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The figures are fairly consistent. There are no significant differences in previous months' statistics," he told The Local.
Although a large proportion of applicants were identified to be over 18 years old, this does not necessarily mean that applicants would have lied about their age.
In May, the Agency published 581 test results and announced that in 442 cases there were "reports that the subject is 18 years old or older".
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it became apparent that 243 cases had been openly reported by the applicant to be completed this year for 18 years.
The medical age assessment method used in tests takes x-rays of wisdom teeth and magnetic images of knee joints. Then dentists and radiologists analyze the images. The method has also been criticised.
One of the suspects is endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolin Institute, whose work involves assessing human biological maturity.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I believe that the method used is not the right one.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we cannot determine the age for sure, we should not pretend that we can do it," he said to the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson, the Office of the Law Administration, defended the accuracy of the tests: "It is generally possible to say that the risk of determining a child as an adult is small.
The risk is highest in a situation where the test will soon be 18 years old and then the risk will be about 10%."
Ilone collapsed 30 seats in Scotland
Five more than par scored in the third round of the third round, Mikko Ilosen spent 30 points down on the score of the golf tour in Scotland.
Ilonen left for Saturday, divided on the 11th, but was found at the end of the round to divide the 41st.
Iloselle grew up in a difficult coil with three bogs followed by one double bog.
The rest of us had a hard time, too.
Ian Poulter, an Englishman, rose up to share the top place on one of the under par rounds, even though he told us that there was enough work to do with umbrellas.
Keli was raw, but I hung with her and finally the day was good, Poulter tuum.
He's sharing the top position with his countryman Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
The Governor of West Virginia changes the party
On Thursday night at Trump's campaign, the democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced that he would change the party.
"The Democrats simply rejected me," Justice said.
"Today I can tell you after many prayers and thorough reflections... "Today I will tell the West Virginia that I can no longer help you as governor of the Democrats."
The audience broke out for a rascal of applause.
"Morning as a member of the registered Republican Party," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd tell you it's time for a new game."
Trump promised earlier that an important announcement would be made at the Western Virginia campaign.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia because Justice did not support the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016. According to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited from his father a mining company and owns coal mines in five states.
His assets are worth about $1.59 billion.
On Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement saying that "Governor Justice's party exchange is another attack on a democratic party that prefers to build obstacles rather than better America."
"The Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, the Justice announcement is the latest setback for a party that has no leadership and is unable to find a positive message that combines people," Ronna McDaniel, representative of RNC, said in his opinion to the CBS news.
Flashes sown damage - Thursday coming even the summer very thunderday
For the rest of the week, there will also be more thunders in Southern Finland.
Over the past week, it has hatched especially in the middle and northern parts of the country and in the region of Varsinais-Suomi.
In the night between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning lit several fires.
According to the meteorologist, Thursday may be the very day of the summer so far.
The thunderstorms have finally found Finland, too.
During the past week, lightning has been used, especially in the middle and northern parts of the country and in the region of Varsinais-Suomi.
At the table, lightning struck the power center of the row house, causing a small fire.
The rescue unit received a report of the fire about 15 minutes before midnight on Wednesday.
The electric station was located in the sauna room at the end of the row house.
The rescue unit was able to chew the roof and wall to find the fire escapes and put out the fire in a good way.
In total, eleven apartments were left without electricity, but personal injuries were avoided.
In the Loimaa, the lightning set the building on fire in the nucleus in Harjumaa before midnight.
The building was already in full operation at the time of the fire, and the emergency unit could only prevent the fire from spreading.
An outer building about 50 square feet [50 sq m] burned to the ground.
In the direction of the dome in Rääkkylä, the lightning struck its own home.
The people of the house were outside the building and witnessed a dazzling lightning attack.
The rescue unit came by to check the case, but this time the lightning didn't get enough fire - just a few fuses blew up.
In traffic, a thunderstorm caused problems on the train track between the Seinäjoki River and Vaasa, when lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
Information on the fault was received between 8 and 9 Thursday morning, after which the trains were replaced by buses.
The problem could only be corrected shortly before five o'clock in the afternoon.
Since then, the train has been able to continue normally also with a thunderous track section.
Flashes have sown destruction across Finland.
However, climate change has been relatively low this summer.
These summer's thunders have been completely miserable!
Wednesday and Thursday are mostly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the small lightning discharge of the summer, it seems even powerful in many of them.
This might seem like a real hard time, but that's what it's been like compared to the thunders of this summer," Tuovinen says.
On Wednesday, the landslides were blinking 1 700 times, and on Thursday there has been potential for even the hardest day of the summer: by about 16 o’clock, the poster had 1,790 landsals.
If the weather continues on to the very beginning of the night, then more than two thousand lightnings can be achieved, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous year was seen in 2015, when the number of lightnings was about 30,000.
By Wednesday, the number of lightnings of this year had risen to 18 386.
So there is still something to be attached to so that this year does not break the two-year record.
However, you can expect the grandfather to continue.
According to Tuovinen, during the end of the week the air above Finland remains warm and humid, which is an acceptable birth environment for the thunders.
The main weight of the thunders is to move south by Saturday from the northern parts of the country, where about 2,000 lightning days can be obtained on Saturdays and Sundays.
The central part of the country is a more coherent rainland.
In such a way, Tuovinen says that it's only a small matter of thunder.
Coe lauds Russia's "public" apology for the doping scandal
The world's sport boss Sebastian Coe openly praised the apology he described, which Russia made on Thursday due to the doping scandal, but added that it was not yet time to stop Russia's ban on participation.
At the IAAF Congress held on Thursday, the Russian sports director Dmitri Shljahtin said that the ban on Russia is appropriate and that he is determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all those athletes who took gold or silver medals in competitions".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of the continuation of the ban. Russia was excluded from sports competitions in November 2015, after the World Anti-Doping Office's WADA report provided evidence of the state-supported doping in Russia.
"I think his answer was very straightforward today. It was a very open presentation," Coe, President of the IAAF, told the journalists.
"The whole Council and Congress welcomed the fact that the Russian Federation of Sports admitted that the country had gone through difficult times and announced that it would do everything in its power to reorganise its activities."
Mr Coe also said that he was "satisfied" with the acceptance by Russia of the conditions for the closure of the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the group's recommendation that this is not the time to end the Russian ban," Coe said.
"In the coming months, we must do everything we can to normalise the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want clean athletes to be separate from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes compete on the status of a neutral athlete in London for the World Cup of Sports, which starts on Friday, and have met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
Rune Andersen, Director of the IAAF Working Group, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet many requirements before it can be restored.
"Tests are still insufficient and the disabled trainers continue to operate freely," he told journalists on Friday after his presentation to the IAAF Council in London.
The production company failed the weak success of Tom of Finland
Tom of Finland did not succeed as the authors hoped, says Yle.
To be honest, I am disappointed to admit that the CEO of Helsinki Film who produced the film is Annika Sucksdorff Yle at an interview.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and that's what it is.
The film was premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached a fair 100 000 viewers, which is about EUR 5 million, compared to the film budget.
There was no lottery gain, but now it's important that investors get theirs back.
If the film had been better in the country, they would have already got their money.
Now we have to wait for small streams of foreign distributions, Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoski.
How the financial rules of football affect the transfer of Neymar to Paris
The provisions restricting the use of European football clubs do not prevent the transfer of Neymar from Spain to Paris Saint-Germain, France.
Its possible sanctions for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by the European football regulatory UEFA, which can prevent teams from participating in the highly respected Master League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced fair-game economic rules, according to which PSG must be able to demonstrate that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without significant losses.
EUR 222 million was paid to Barcelona for the termination of the Brazilian agreement, and Neymar's annual salary in the new company is in tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France involves a wide range of economic aspects.
The PSG has no difficulty in paying Neymar's transfer amount and attachs him to its Star Guard, as the next person will be financed by a family of rulers enriched with Qatar's oil.
The clubs are allowed to use large amounts of money to acquire players, but they need to be balanced with real income sources, so that football-related business is not loss-making.
The economic rules for fair play were drawn up on the initiative of Michel Platinum, the French President of UEFA, elected in 2007.
As an ex - football player, Platinum believed that the pursuit of success with debt was cheating and led to serious problems if banks or owners supported it.
In 2011, the focus of fair play economic rules shifted from the debt of clubs to the monitoring of their losses.
The change meant that the implementation of the business model that Roman Abramovich used for the first time in Chelsea in 2003 was significantly hampered. Abramovich bought a promising team, used huge sums of money to buy a player and created a global brand.
The current three-year period of economic rules for fair play will last until 2018. During that period, the clubs will be allowed to make a loss of up to EUR 30 million.
Although Platini had to leave the role of UEFA president scandalously in 2015, his successor Alexander Cefer also wants to control the reckless use of the clubs.
"The rules of fair play are still in use and we will apply them in the future", Andrea Traverso, responsible for fair game economic rules in UEFA, told the Associated Press News Office last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of his contract with one-off compensation, it may be allowed to pay the amount in the accounts for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has concluded a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be recorded at the annual cost of EUR 44.4 million for the next five years.
On the basis of fair-game financial rules, the first sanctions were distributed in 2014. The largest sanctions were imposed on PSG and Abu Dhab to Manchester City.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million. In addition, the Society was ordered to limit its team to 21 players for the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors clubs that may attempt to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their revenues through the company owners of the club.
If, for example, the Qatar company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be above the normal market level, UEFA will not calculate the aid as the actual result.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the support of the Qatari Tourism Authority for PSG was oversized.
It has also been shown that part of Neymar's contribution to PSG could be financed by contributions available from Qatar's 2022 World Cup Management Agency.
However, the PSG and the Organisational Commission have prohibited Neymar from being the ambassador of the World Cup, which would be very easy for UEFA to reveal.
In view of the past sanctions imposed by PSG, UEFA will follow more closely than usual companies to circumvent the rules.
On Thursday, the available sources reported that UEFA had not negotiated with PSG on the transfer of Neymar.
The sources gave an interview to the Associated Press News Office on condition that their identity is not disclosed because they do not have the authority to discuss the PSG situation.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG’s net sales for the period 2015-2016 were EUR 542.4 million and operating profit was over EUR 10 million.
The accounts for the last period have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar to attract new sponsors and increase the sales of follow-up and gaming shirts.
The Society estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30 % with the Neymar agreement.
The Spanish league, which was clearly agitated by the departure of the world's best player, was trying to make Neymar's move more difficult, and it was claimed to be breaking the financial rules of a fair game.
"This is a clear economic doping case for both the Society and the State", said Javier Tebas, President of the Spanish League, to the Spanish newspaper AS.
Arsenal’s manager, Arsene Wenger, is also committed to financing the activities of the football club. Arsenal is owned by an American sports club.
"The case is the result of ownership, which has changed the football operating environment completely in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"All is possible after the state owns the football team.
There are so many interests involved in the fact that the famous player represents the state."
It is now urgent: Finnish M.M. sports coach stuck in Helsinki
Long-term jumper Arttu Pajulahti and triangularist Kristiina Mäkelä coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, even though he should coach sports in the World Cup in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
The barrier will compete tomorrow in the reduction of the long jump and Mäkela on Saturday in the reduction of the tripartite.
However, the two coach, the Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa for Great Britain.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with this in the British Embassy without results.
The coach has an invitation from the World Cup organisers as a document, but it has not been able to obtain a visa either.
I wonder if this is the first of Brexit's symptoms, or what, Coach Jorma Kemppainen said.
He has always been successful in dealing with visa issues in the past, but there are now problems.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Union (SUL) for years now.
It doesn't matter that much.
As long as someone at the stadium was looking at the step-signs, Arttu Pajulahti said that his coach would be excluded.
The MM Medal for FinlandLonto requires a miracle
The World Cup will start in London today on Friday and last a fair week on Sunday 13 August.
Sports, cross-country skiing and hockey are the species on which Finnish bench athletes are eager to take their passions from year to year, whether they succeed or not.
In the hearts of bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
There are other meters, of course.
Less attention is paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from prizes to fairs, where experience is acquired by maturing the athlete's performance to the level that the MM medal for adults is genuinely possible.
Now there are no such young athletes on the Finnish small World Cup, but there are no other team.
The MM medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the interest and surprise of sport is that miracles can also happen.
It drags bench athletes around the TV screen and glues to watch the competitions, even though London medals are solved due to time difference only at night.
In the previous World Cup 2015 Finland received one bronze medal.
That's what the spear thrower Tero Long Mountain brought.
Worms await the Long Mountain medal even now, even though one tells the results of recent times of his and other throwers, as well as the remaining of the Long Mountain will be cut down in last summer’s prizes.
No matter what happened to these races, Long Mountain remains a great Finnish sports hero in its history.
For other Finnish athletes, access to the final competition or making their own record is a good enough performance.
Hope and trust in the realistic medal hunt of Finland's sport over the coming years will be a good success in the international values of young people as well this summer.
It is more important to improve the skills of young people and to support their work financially than to maintain a small group of representative athletes.
The success is not an instant but requires years of sweaty work from athletes and patience from both coaching and bench athletes.
Finns also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
I hope the London Games will remain in history as the games of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not because, for example, of the fear of terrorism or the horrific attacks.
"But I'll be sorry."
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi is the second big air race in Colorado, USA.
Copper Mountain's second-classer is Lake Rukajärvi's best big air world cup.
The women's race was won by Jamie Anderson of the United States.
Rukajärvi raised 147 points in the competition.
He tried on his last jump at the caballerial 1080 for the first time in the race, and it was very close to success.
I feel good and I feel good now, but I'm sorry that the last jump didn't go exactly.
I'm going to try it again from now on, muumi Rukajärvi.
In the big air of snowboarding, the competitor jumps from a jumper made for the species.
Viking Line’s new high-speed ship caught up in a port in Helsinki
The new high-speed FSTR of the shipping company Viking is very late on the schedule.
The high-speed ship had to leave Helsinki for Tallinn at 6 p.m.
There was a loading in the ship in eight countries.
The ship was already late in Helsinki.
For at least an hour and a half, I've been waiting for him to board the ship.
Now the car queue moves slightly, the Estonian waiting for access to the ship at the port of Helsinki, Johannes Rebane, reported at 19.30.
Rebane thought there was a technical error on the new ship.
Rebane reported that the shipping company had brought water bottles to those waiting for access to the ship.
Christa Grönlund, the Viking Head of Communications, tells IS that there was a technical error.
It was repaired at the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a few hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be late for a few hours on the return journey to Tallinn.
The ship was supposed to leave Tallinn at 8:15 p.m.

The police are driving traffic on the Sixways, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
From memory point of the journey along the road 13 to the port of Mustola.
Small District Nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
At the same time, the story fades both the days of the 80s and the GRUNCE of characters (at that time David Wain and Michael Showalter made a great series of The State Sects for MTV) and their own time – 2001 before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and other stars in the series moved to bigger things in their career.
As a cultural product, it is both a parodia and a description of the continuous memory that we have stuck to during the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it seems to have lived a long time ago.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, and not only because of its absurd humor (the background story of H. Jon Benjamin’s speaking vegetable can).
The core of the joke is that middle-aged actors act towards full-age lusty teenagers. Emphasizing it makes it impossible to reach the past part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults act as adults, is less emotional and has a more fragmented barodity: for example, the '90s stand-up movies, such as the horror movie Hand that swings the balls.
In one section, one of the characters digs out Apple Powerbook, inline roller skaters and "other stuff from 1991".
Many stories are the same as before.
Good-hearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but has still not been over Katie (Margurie Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And there's a crazy plot that involves Ronald Reagan (the same as Michael Showalter) as George H. W. Bush (which is acting as Michael Ian Black).
As always in these series, the best side paths are.
It's especially fun to see an exuberant Paul Rudd, who has a lower lip under the beard, i.e. Matt Dillon's "soul patch" movie in Singles.
The moments of random madness may put this series on the flight as a kind of recursive Seven Up! series until it has its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Tweety Years Later. In its last scene, the group of friends will go to Wet Hot American Summer on their first night.
Amazon's Comrade Detective series appeals to another kind of nostalgia: The Americans series's cold war spirit, the Atomic Blonde movie, and even the Glow series's mousebrow, where the east meets the west.
The comedy series has been created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and it has been directed by Rhys Thomas. It has been made a Romanian police drama in the 1980s, where a Bucharest cop fights for truth, atheism and Marksism-leninism.
Mostly as a hard-faced Gregor and an idealistic Iosefina, Florin Piersic Jr and Cornelius Ulici are seen. Their words have been dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
But it's not much else, is it?
There are some good visual jokes in the series (cops spend time watching TV chess in the same way that Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous sound actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
However, Comrade Detective is too attached to the imitation of a clumsy socialist drama – a killer hiding behind Reagan's mask, for example. Therefore, often the series begins to feel like a clumsy propaganda.
Six long periods are too long, and the sense of humor in the series is not fast enough and not rich enough.
In summary, the series might be better able to act as an agitprop-satier, even when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy and there are always two fat men in the lobby sniping hamburgers.
The message to the imagined Communist audience is that Western culture can make all consumer goods and fast food.
The imaginative Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: as a result of our own recent history and their history.
Kouvolan Toni Tauru will rise in the ring on Saturday in Macao against a former UFC player
Toni Taurus wants to keep the fight up.
Toni Tauru will have a hard bone in Macao because Leandro Issa, a Brazilian, fought last year in the UFC organization.
The Brazilian also has the black belt of jujutty and the world championship of the species.
For once, I fight against my parents.
That's funny. 32-year-old Tauru tells you.
Kouvolian had to get into the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The fight was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three struggles were made in a timely fashion to the Chinese Autonomous Community of Macao.
I've never seen Taurus like that before.
This was the first time my fight was canceled.
It was annoying, because preparation and training took a lot of time.
The fighter, however, is pleased that a new time has been set for the struggle.
A week's waiting doesn't have much effect on preparation.
The transplant doesn't work because it doesn't get better a week.
If you practice too much now, it could get worse.
In a few of his previous struggles, he has faced opponents with the strengths of uplifting.
This time, things are different.
Issa is described as being a typical Brazilian.
He's a rather aggressive fighter.
I'll bet he's gonna come on hard in the first round and try to get him on the carpet.
He's won the world title, so he knows how to fight.
The last match of Kouvolan did not go as planned.
Kevin Belingon, the Philippines, hit Taurus badly in the eye, and his victory remained with the Philippines.
I've never been so up-to-date, especially: he didn't get a single hit.
When I left, he hit my eyeball.
It's been a long time.
New motivation
Some free fighters fight once a year, some rise more often in the ring.
For example, the future opponent Issa fought the last time in September.
Taurus, on the other hand, had three fights last year.
There is now a second struggle in the coming year.
Sometimes I get pregnant.
In recent years, I've been working out and being in good shape all the time.
But I've only fought for fighting.
When the 32-year-old heard about the coming encounter, he decided to change the scenery for a moment.
I was in Espoo training and I got the pleasure back.
We got really good practice with a guy from Sweden, too.
Training was a great help, since on Saturday, a Kouvolan will have to prepare for physical struggle.
I've been trained against opponents of the same size and trained in a vertical fight.
Being able to fight is the main tactics of a 32-year-old.
We have to hit him rationally.
If there's a chance, I'll take the property myself.
Lower exports must not be given free of charge because they consume the most.
Macao attracts Taurus from China before.
They say it's China's Las Vegas.
I think there's a big, great evening ahead of you.
The Bank of England maintains interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to report that it maintains interest rates once economic growth has been without effort and inflation has stopped speculation on interest payments.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to slow down, and the bank has moved interest payments because of the increasing pressure on the income level of the families.
The decision-makers of the monetary policy committee of the central bank decided, with a vote of 6-2, to maintain interest rates at 0.25% this month, with less support due to the fact that economic growth has been without effort.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank dropped its 2017 growth forecast to 1.7% and its 2018 forecast to 1.6% and warned that the household income level was under increasing pressure, as inflation is expected to continue to rise by close to 3% in autumn.
However, according to the Bank, interest payments are needed in the coming years to contain the inflation rate that Brexit is speeding up, and the Bank also announced that credit costs may need to be increased more than expected on the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the committee decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package that began to take place a year ago in the subsequent references to the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will cease the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide cost-effective financing to banks through the Programme of £15 million more, i.e. a total of £ 115 million.
The Protocol on the Bank's interest rate decision states that "The Commission's forecast of a financial policy committee is that the slow development of GDP will continue over the next few years as household real income falls in consumption."
With regard to interest rates, the Bank reiterated the need for 'a degree of tightening up of monetary policy' in order to contain inflation, a bit more generally, than the expectations of the market.
The market is currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that potential increases are 'steps' and 'limits'.
In May, the Bank predicted an increase of 1.9 per cent this year and an increase of 1.7 per cent for the next year.
It now held its 2018 growth forecast at 1.8%.
In comparison to the dollar and the euro, the weight was weakened as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the weight decreased by 0.5 per cent and was $1.31, compared to the euro by 0.4 per cent and by 1.11 per cent.
The decision to maintain interest rates was taken after the expected lower growth rates were lower than expected from interest rates, with GDP rising by 0.3% in the second quarter and 0.2% in the first quarter.
The Bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter but to rise slightly at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation report gave little hope for rising inflation and for households with low wage increases, and the Bank considers that the situation is getting worse before it gets better.
The Bank added that monetary policy cannot prevent the fall in revenue in the coming years, but expects wage developments to recover "in a significant way" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by the strong growth in demand for British products as a result of a weak weight, which will cancel part of the fall in private consumption.
The decision was taken one year after interest rates were calculated at 0.25% following the EU's population vote, which hit the drop in pounds.
The Bank considers that the overall impact of the decision is likely to be apparent in prices and in the economy only after four years.
Before the most recent decision by the central bank, interest payments had become increasingly demanding, as inflation put pressure on households, with three decision-makers demanding an increase of 0.5% in July.
Last month, inflation accelerated to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent in June. However, according to the Bank, it was expected and inflation was increasing again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, the overrun of its target of 2% was due to the 'total' weak weight.
"In view of the recent drop in swap interest rates, competition in the mortgage market seems to be tightening up further when creditors are hotly looking for customers and want to end the year strongly," says Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"The brands look particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is coming to an end; the new agreements are more popular, their interest rates are low and there are also unnecessary alternatives."
NHS prescribes a controversial HIV medicine for 10,000 people
As of September, patients can be prescribed a ‘reversible’ anti-HIV medicine, the Supreme Court concluded a dispute concerning the financing of the medicine in the English public health system (NHS).
NHS reported that Pre-exposure Prevention (PREP) is prescribed to approximately 10 000 people during the first three-year trial. Before coitus, approximately 86% of individuals at high risk have been found to reduce the risk of infection.
NHS agreed to finance the experiment after the court court ruling was held last year, according to which NHS is able to pay the medicine PrEP, although it claims that local authorities should be able to finance it.
Simon Stevens, Director of the NHS, called the decision announced on Thursday a "remarkable new intervention", and the National AIDS Organisation described it as a "responsible moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to receive registrations for an experiment which will be extended in October to other clinics. The experiment will reach its full scope in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prevention therapy (PREP) should be initiated before sexual intercourse with an HIV medicine that reduces the risk of infection.
Experience has shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV demand in risk groups.
The medicine to be taken before sexual intercourse means that there are enough drugs in the body during sexual intercourse that prevent HIV infection.
You can take it every day or two hours before you have sex.
The treatment target group includes gay men, bisexual men and transsexuals, as well as people with HIV-positive partners who are not receiving effective treatment.
The clinics choose the conditions for the experiment from men, women and transsexuals, as well as from those whose HIV-positive partners are not known to receive antiretroviral therapy.
People living in England who are registered for general medical treatment may also apply for an experiment at their local sexual health clinic.
The programme costs £10 million, and this week NHS signed a contract for medicinal products after an international tender.
The purpose of the trial is to assess the potential of the medicine PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, taking it and implementing treatment.
"This significant new intervention should complement and enhance existing diverse and increasingly effective measures to prevent HIV", said Stevens.
"It is yet another significant achievement in the fight that has lasted for more than 30 years to solve the major health challenge of mankind."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," says Deborah Gold, the leader of the national AIDS organization.
"If PrEP is given correctly to people who need it and who are at risk, it can have a reversible effect on their HIV epidemic in England.
From September onwards, the risk group will be able to obtain, through an experiment funded by the NHS, a medicine that they can decide on independently without the need to negotiate with the partner, with an effect that will have an effect that will improve the lives of very many people.
This was welcome news."
"Now, the most important thing is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly throughout the country and that no one in the risk group is excluded," says Ian Green, director of Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The medicine PrEP used in the trial has been obtained and we will soon be able to protect tens of thousands of people from HIV infection."
"The launch of the PREP trial is a welcome event, which lasted in vain for several months due to the slowdown of the government," says Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health of the Shadow Government.
"We have evidence that the medicine can have a reversible effect on our work to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment will help us to better understand the real benefits of the medicine PrEP.
It is now important that the experiment be launched as soon as possible throughout the country, so that we can protect those exposed to HIV and get a step closer to the situation where the spread of HIV in society has been stopped."
Quality of life: the middle layer and smart interior solutions have made the small Earl's Court apartment a spacious home
The former banker Joanne Leipzig, who was excited about the renovation of the properties, moved from Knightsbridge to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of Queen Anna's ancient-style house. The success of the renovation is that Joanne hasn't packed up and moved yet.
"This before I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a significantly larger apartment," Joanne says.
"I'm looking for something similar in my price class.
I went to this house show and found that the rooms were as high as my apartment back then.
"I was in love right away, and I made an offer the same day."
Since then, about 90 square apartment has experienced a complete transformation.
It was a twin with only the kitchen access. Joanne wanted more storage space and an intermediate floor so that the room height could be used.
"I wanted space, big windows and a lot of light.
That was my demands," he says.
He hired Erfan Azad from the Duck & Shed Planning Office in Notting Hill. Erfan was assigned to take advantage of nearly four meters of high room space and to create an apartment that would not only be a place for repair and sale but also a home.
The height of the room was not enough for two double spaces, so the challenge was to build an intermediate floor that could stand.
The solution required the creative thinking of Erfan.
"Steel structures are pretty complicated.
The facilities had to be doubled so that they did not need to be cynical.
The structures had to be modified in such a way that the height was just right both above and below them."
Erfan was able to place two fully tall rooms in the space with fascinating details.
On the intermediate floor, a copper-cracked window opens in the elegant living space of Retrouius.
The classic furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille vintage lights create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, the feeling of space and light.
The mirrors at both ends of the short corridor make the corridor look longer.
The kitchen spaced mirror is like a window with a view of the other room.
The mirrored furniture of the entrance has a storage space for Joanne’s meals and glassware.
It adds to the style that the kitchen can be hidden when it is not used.
Kitchens equipped with a folding door are not a new solution,
But the unique thing about Joanne's kitchen is that the door is raised in the same way as the garage door.
"It took some planning," Erfan says about the steel-enriched MDF door.
"It's balanced, so it slides very easily when it's lifted."
With rational space use and storage planning, Joanne received 16 extra squares, a second bedroom and a better bottom solution.
"When selling the property, the area will be decided – or the value of the property", says Erfan.
"In the underlying case, the real estate agent walks into the apartment and calculates the price based on the surface area."
Joanne's apartment added a surface area using quality materials that bring luxury to the room.
"The widow is exposed to the materials of the apartment, and the emotional connection to the apartment is partly based on them," says Erfan.
"No one's attached to the power lines in the walls.
They're important too, but not the same."
Joanne's apartment is an example of the fact that good design and extra bodies can make basic housing exceptionally fine.
It can also happen that you no longer want to move out of the apartment.
The pregnant princess Sofia radiated in her summer classes
Princess Sofia's residence was hit.
Princess Sofia was last represented in Båstad, Sweden before she was born.
For dinner at A Sustainable Tomorrow, the princess had chosen a gentle, light blue dress.
Sofia was represented at the event as a smiling person.
Swedish princess Sofia has visited Sweden this week in Båstad.
On Wednesday, Sofia was represented at A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a wonderful blue body-long dress that wore a wonderfully pregnant princess.
Sofia has arrived in a dark blue outfit.
This is the last mission in which Sofia represents before giving birth.
His calculated time is in September.
For the event’s dinner, Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel blue dress that landed beautifully.
The style was crowned with large earrings and a stylish little bag.
The pastel blue put on a fine princess.
Sofia has been on a mission this week in Båstad, Sweden.
Sofia was filling up her living in a small bag.
Sophia was beaming directly in her fresh summer classes.
Sofia was inspired at the event even to talk to photographers.
Now I'm just holding on to my stomach, Sofia said, laughing and referring to her late pregnancy.
He's raising us with a sweet chili.
In the summer of 1996, a Thai food was sold at Lahti Square.
The Lahtis didn't dare taste. They walked by.
At home, the food was sold by Panya Sumsri Penttilä, among the familiar Panja.
He did not know much about Finland, and at that time the Finns did not know Thai.
Because the people were afraid to go out and eat, Panjah offered free flavors.
Thus he taught the Gulfs to eat Thai food, and the spring roll at a time.
Taste it, he said.
I got caught in the valley.
I used to come more and more often, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened her Thai dishes at the Lahti Chamber of Commerce.
It had two small tables, I think it had less than 20 seats.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to a stranger.
When you are hungry and limited to places, you cannot leave an empty chair between yourself and a stranger.
We got to know each other a little bit better, and we became friends.
Finally, I sat by the plate with a dictionary to learn Thai.
Two years went by the mall, but then the restaurant had to change because the spices they made themselves smelled too much in the hall.
A new place was released at the end of the store.
There's room.
Now we’re going to have to sit back in our own tables, just in the worst times, we’re going to have to be shy and ask the guests if there’s room next door.
The Panja knows her client.
They're going to tell him about what happened and who they've seen.
He knows what food everyone eats.
He's seen the lives of his customers vary and the food company changes.
He remembers the name of the man I went to eat my first spring roll.
He remembers me as thin and fat, and remembers what I was when I was young.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than the others, sit in my seat next to the kitchen door and change the dishes with Panya, who leans on the counter.
Food is not the most important thing he gives us.
He has taught tolerance and internationalism with a sweet chili sauce.
In addition to our taste, he has opened our thoughts and hearts.
Today, many people talk to him about Thai - thanks to the increased popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he's been having a hard time, he's always been kind.
He's busy.
On top of the restaurant, he goes into mushrooms and blueberry.
Last week at the restaurant was a brief two decades of fulfillment.
We customers had strawberry cake for dessert.
Without alarm or attention, this remarkable day, along with the work.
The discovery of the underground base revealed 173 Isis terrorists who were prepared to attack Europe.
From the beginning of the year, security authorities received a list that was important for anti-terrorist work.
This list contains more than 170 Isis fighters who are prepared to attack Europe.
According to the German Die Welt, there are a total of 173 persons and the document includes not only their personal data, but also photos of each person.
Of the persons mentioned in the list, more than 130 are Iraqis, but six are also Europeans.
They are from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tajikistan and Saudi Arabia.
I've got an update on the list and a couple of weeks ago.
Now the location of the list and the information contained in it have been revised.
According to the newspaper, the Iraqi army's special forces found the terrorist identity and images in the investigation into the underground base of the terrorist organization in Mosul.
The U.S. intelligence authorities assessed the authenticity of the papers and sent them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
There was a fear that something big and serious would be planned in the Western countries by terrorists after Isis fell in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and images of all persons but also their date of birth, invented subsites and information about the person's country of origin.
There are also detailed terrorist specialities on the list.
For example, for a German 27-year-old Sami J., on the list, reads Abu Assid al-Alman, or German.
He was reported to have left Germany in 2012, traveling to Egypt first, then to Libya and later to Syria to join the Isis ranks.
He's got a suicide bomber written next to his picture.
There's no further information on the fate of a man.
A total of around 6 000 fighters have left Europe in the lines of Isis, whose fate is uncertain.
The man sank under the surface in the Tokoinranta of Helsinki
Based on the interviews at the rescue unit, the man wanted to show that he could swim.
Even a bucket can save the drowning's life.
In Tokoinranta, Helsinki, on Thursday, people were rescued.
According to Ville Estlander, the firefighter at the Helsinki rescue unit, the situation was over quickly.
They found the person under the water about 15 minutes after the report.
The rescue diver found him under the surface, Estlander tells us.
The rescue unit received a notification after 4:30 this afternoon.
The person was delivered to the first care centre.
Estlander says it was a man about 50 years old.
Based on the interviews, the man wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is over.
Mr Estlander thanked the authorities for their cooperation with the Border Guard and the police.
It was a mission led by the Border Guard.
The locals also guided the divers perfectly.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and the police.
Two passenger cars crashed nine people in Eura cars, three were seriously injured.
There were a total of nine people in the cars, the rest of which suffered minor injuries, says the firefighter on duty.
Among the injured are both men and women.
The accident occurred at the intersection of three roads at four o'clock in the day.
The accident occurred when another car turned behind the warning triangle in front of another car, says the firefighter on duty.
According to the rescue facility, the intersection area has a speed limit of 80 km/h.
Brothers fighting over 500 million dollars in real estate
Two brothers are arguing about Victoria’s largest real estate empire worth more than 500 million dollars, which is connected to their Italian family 40 years ago to establish a family business.
The former president of Carlton football club and real estate developer Colin De Lutis live in Torak's value zone only three houses away from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has taken the highest court for the division of property and business property between the brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute about the divorce.
Brothers and their mothers, Anna, together, own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, and the family began to collect property when they bought a store on Collingwood Smith Street in 1973.
The family set up a Westco Jeans store that expanded into 160 stores.
The trade chain was sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was used for real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and suburbs.
According to a family agreement with the late father, Colin owns about two-thirds of the company's assets. Paul describes his father as "the carrying power of the family and the central character".
According to the court documents, the asset distribution ratio means that Colin owns real estate worth about 316 million dollars and Paul owns approximately 176 million dollars.
Paul is not satisfied with the distribution of property and money.
"I think Colin left the best properties for himself in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first sworn certificate to the court in 2015.
The case was first dealt with in the Supreme Court last Friday after several mediation companies.
The brothers are now also arguing about who controls the existing business, and Paul claims that Colin has excluded him from the business.
According to Colin, the argument is not true, and he's accusing Paul of poor management of some of the properties.
Colin writes together of his first sworn testimony that he would like to find a solution to the matter.
"In line with our Italian traditions, my family is the most important thing to me," Colin says in her opinion.
The costs of the case are constantly increasing. There are hundreds of other forms of sworn statements, e-mails and reports. The case is investigating consultants such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who set up milk bars and delicious shops in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s they bought a store in Brunswick.
They were used as collateral to buy a family property in Collingwood, where Colin set up the family's first jeans store.
Colin says that he founded a store "in the last few years of high school while Paul was still a child (about 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis tells us that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer the properties to their boys in a fair manner.
"Luigi often said that he did not want the brothers to go to court," Anna wrote in her opinion.
The other two sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in De Lutis Group's business. Colin said that Mark received $10 million and Luke 26 million when he left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are a "breaker of the financial conditions of their departure".
Colin has kept a low profile, although he is a former member of the Australian League Board and the best friend of Eddie McGuire's 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin answered, and he said in his text that it was not possible to comment on it properly because it was being dealt with in court.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and draw my family's name to the legal fight," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to accept the demands of his brother.
"Our father would not have wanted us to argue like this," Colin continued and said that he hoped that a solution would be reached.
On Friday, hope seemed to have passed.
"Our case will be settled in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to limit the President's media use.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally make it.
First.
According to the Poltico newspaper, the new head of staff of the White House intends to limit the media use of President Trump and the follow-up to the news so that the boss does not get in trouble so often.
Journalist Josh Dawsey reports:
"When the new head of staff of the White House, John F. Kelly, met with the management staff on his first working day, he raised the key issue he intends to solve: he intends to limit the access to information of President Donald Trump.
Kelly told the White House employees that all the information – printed as well as those consulted at the press events – must be transported through her because the President makes better decisions when he gets good information."
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's media use and failed.
For decades President Trump has a relationship with television – and as President he continues to watch a lot of TV.
"If the candidate for President Trump was nervous about unfair news, it was worth showing him that sympathetic media were handling things more fairly," said Sam Nunberg, who worked as a consultant in the Trump campaign, told Politico magazine in February.
Politicalo’s journalist Tara Palmer wrote at the time that “the management of Trump’s Twitter use by six former campaign workers is essential that his personal media flow includes a steady stream of praise”.
Okay.
But it's ridiculous to say that the use of Trump's Twitter would never have been under control.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something we don’t know — perhaps the Trump twitters would have been even sharper without their efforts.
We'll probably never know what kind of messages Trump missed.
If his staff have been able to prevent him from causing problems even a few times, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has consistently been able to prevent the mischief of Trump.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing groups in the White House trying to drive their cause by providing Trump with information that supports their views, which can be reliable — or not.
In May, Politico wrote that counsellors deliberately provide the President with questionable information.
A reporter named Shane Goldmacher told me about a case:
"The current and former employees of the Trompi say that he can be extremely angry with the cuttings in which he is criticized – especially if they tell of harmful data leaks, and then he must know where the information comes from.
That was the case at the end of February when someone brutally gave the President a copy of the news on GotNews.com, established by the web-provocator Charles C. Johnson, which accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of several leaks in the White House.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter because of harassment, and he had previously spread false accusations and withdrawn them later. He also did not provide concrete evidence.
Nevertheless, Trump had begun reading the case after asking questions about Walsh's staff."
Goldmacher added that at that time the head of staff Reince Priebus and the White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter "were trying to introduce a system for managing documents going to Trump".
And what was the result?
Kelly's gonna try the same thing three months later.
He may prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants are still running their own business.
These unaltered facts make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Neymar concluded a five-year agreement with PSG
A five - year agreement has been concluded with the French football club PSG, reports the news agency AFP.
On Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar’s representatives had paid a purchase price of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelona, a football player in the Spanish league.
Neymar’s agreement with Barcelona was therefore terminated and was free to move to the Parisian Society’s PSG.
The transfer amount of EUR 222 million is the largest in the history of football.
In the past, Manchester United had a record that cost EUR 105 million last summer for the French Paul Pogba.
The PSG is owned by the state-owned Qatarese company Qatar Sports Investment.
The Association is chaired by a former tennis pro, Qatarist Nasser al-Khelaif.
Neymar is believed to be arriving in Paris on Friday.
The success writer, Raia Oranen, used the hypnosis of alcoholism and fear of flying: "I'm fine in my life"
From the TV series Rose Time and Clean White sheets the well-known success writer Raija Oranen just spent his 69th anniversary.
Hypnosis helped Raia Ora.
In addition to writing, five grandchildren hold the grandmothers so much that Raia and her husband, Jyrki, gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola’s apartment after 18 winters.
First they sold their house, but this spring they also left for rent.
The light and the sun, out of the old circles Raijan once took the depression and the alcoholism he has survived.
Even the outside is 20 kilos lighter.
The weight went down when the serotonin medicines were stopped, they were mood medicines.
I used to get help with alcoholism for hypnosis, which also affected flight fear, I won it.
I've been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes a person, a glowing writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been on the same journey for over 45 years.
I feel better than I've ever been.
Jyrki Orane, who worked in the tourism sector too, has been together for over 40 years.
I proposed, and it was getting married two weeks ago, Raia laughs.
Such a drama queen she's always been, she's ended her life with that, Jyrki laughs at her wife.
Orane, who made a huge career as a writer, remembers only good 44 parts Clean white sheets TV series, which touched and moved Finland during the recession.
I finally decided to be the company of the Raikka family in the clothing industry when I read Liisa Seppälä's 50-year interview on the plane.
I was the daughter of a sewing machine myself, my mother also had a clothing store, and sometimes I act as a mannequin, remembers Orane.
He thought the plot of the series and the story changed the Finnish attitude towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savean's investigation and claim revealed it, Orange says.
Raija Oranen lives as a writer for active time, has many manuscripts under work - with hundreds of ideas.
The tourers returned to the alley of the millionaires.
The richest houseowners in West Midlands are once again protruding with the persistent circuitists who managed to cross the wells of the municipality and return to the next field.
The tourers parked a few dozen trailer near a street called a millionaire alley in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the barrier that was needed by the municipality, bringing with them children, horses and the army of vans.
The tourers managed to cross the roadblock at a point that had been left unprotected because of the path.
The deranged residents have accused Solihull of "perfect inability to solve the problem".
An anonymous resident tells us that the Encircuits arrived on Monday night from Bentley Heath, where they had thrown pastors with stones.
"When you have to toughen up, because it seems to be completely incapable of solving the problem.
The tourers were here in May, then they left but returned again.
There was more of them this evening and probably even more of them today."
The resident told me that the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by denying access to parks.
"I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay municipal tax when the municipality can't do anything about it."
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the circuitists returned so soon after they were driven away.
"There's more of them, and they've even put a horse in the park."
According to the informant of Solihull municipality, the municipality is aware of illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal measures with the Solihull police to evict campers as soon as possible.
From the point of view of gathering the evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report to the police any disturbing or criminal activity.
It will help to create an overall picture of the situation for legal proceedings."
The deranged people surrounded Portugal's crash plane
In Portugal, men who were forced to land on a beach full of people have been questioned in court today.
As a result of the forced landing, two people were killed yesterday.
Two men flying the plane may be charged with the death penalty.
At the very least, it is possible to have 16 years of imprisonment in Portugal.
The men's flying small plane had to make a forced landing on the beach of Sao Joao da Caborica near Lisbon due to a technical failure yesterday.
There were hundreds of people on the beach at the time of the event, some of whom ran into the landing plane to escape into the water.
The plane hit a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died immediately.
The machine first hit a man who had his back on the plane.
Immediately thereafter, the plane rose up, and when it landed again, it hit the child’s head, told Philip Janeira Jornal de Noticias, who was on the beach.
The little girl who died was on the beach with her parents.
Her parents didn't get hurt.
On the beach, the small machine was surrounded immediately after the crash, angry.
The girl’s father and other people went to the plane and started beating it up, reported the case in Celia Rocha Correio da Manha.
He called the pilot a criminal. He was desperate.
It's a miracle no more people died.
Two men on the plane were not injured in forced landing.
The tragic loss of his foot of the Finnish star won another MM gold: "With no accident I would not be world champion"
Matti Nagy-Hamari will celebrate early Wednesday morning Finnish time in the World Cup in the World Cup in the Big White of Canada.
Big Hamari also won the World Cup in the past.
All in all, three World Cup titles have already been collected.
That's an incredible World Cup!
Two times the gold was treated, a pretty good beat is drawn, a telephone-targeted Nagy-Hamari was delighted.
The 30-year-old counter thanked his coach and his highly successful preparation in Finland.
According to Big Hamar, the number of challengers in the species is increasing all the time.
The whole paralumic boarding has grown and developed a lot lately.
The differences are decreasing, and there are a lot of newcomers.
Always wondering if there's a black horse coming after you.
Every race seems to have a different winner.
Great Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
From his youth onwards, he had been eagerly counting with his friends, and the accident did not lead to a desire to get on the slope.
It reminds me from time to time what my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that it's a waste of time.
Those cards are played with what is shared, Big Hamari stresses.
It would be cruel to list a serious accident and the loss of limbs as a good shot, and neither will Big Hamari.
But he turned away the terrible difficulty.
Yes, I would say that the situation turned into a victory.
I wouldn't be a three-time world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the largest ferry ride of 23-year-old Big Hamar was already sinking.
The dome headed towards the top went off in fact only after the accident.
When I was a kid, I used to work out with guys, and we used to always get excited about X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that shrunk somewhat over time.
After the accident, I somehow found myself there at the start of the X-Games.
I couldn't have imagined it in advance.
I was 23 years old, and I thought this would be a very long life if I stayed here to be bitter and sad.
I've decided to pull the hammers on my neck and start working.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
The calculator was very pleased with the choice of Leo-Pekka Star as a sportsman of the year.
Four-time Olympic winners won their prize at the January sports fair.
According to Big Hamar, Star's victory is an important signal for Parading.
It was a really big deal, and the victory was definitely earned.
I'm sure this will also open your eyes to the parading world.
Because it's time to launch a two-time world champion Matti Nagy-Hamar's annual athlete campaign?
We'll see about that then.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
The Great Hamari has yet to conquer all the peaks they desire.
Next year, there will be a great goal.
In a year, the Paralympics will be held in South Korea.
They're going to get the medal!
The majority of Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their country permanently unless the war ends and Isis leaves the country.
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees examined the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees cooking bread at refugee camps in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youths do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently.
According to them, the end of the Syrian war and the departure of Isis are the most important things that should happen so that they can return to their homeland.
The Trump regime does not see any change to the Syrian conflict.
The communication chain Burson-Marsteller examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
In nine years, Burson-Marsteller has studied the opinions and attitudes of the Arabs.
This year, the A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees survey investigated the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 Syrian adolescents aged 18-24 years responded to the study, half of whom are women and half are men.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of the young Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their country permanently in the future.
42 per cent of respondents may think that they would return to their country of origin and four per cent could not say.
According to the study, the decision of young people to return home is most affected by the war in Syria and the presence of Isis in the country.
Almost half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most impressive factor in a permanent return, while a quarter of them believe that leaving the country would be the most important thing.
Only less than one tenth of the total number of key factors in the decision are the improvement of the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military action alone will not resolve the conflict
The Syrian youth was asked what is the most important factor in ending the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of war is more important than the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad.
A fair quarter considers the Presidentship of Al-Assad to be an obstacle to the peace treaty.
Almost half of the people feel that political and military solutions are needed to end the current Syrian conflict.
To resolve the conflict by simply military action, there is no belief in just a quarter.
The majority of Syrian refugees see the decline in Isis’ power over the last year, while the fifth feels its power strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important fight against Isis, and in general, terrorism, is that the media would give people information that Isis has nothing to do with Islamism.
Almost as many raised the primary means of military action and education reform.
In the view of just one tenth, the most important thing is to create better jobs for young people.
When asking about the effects of the Trump regime on the Syrian conflict, 66% of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during the Trump regime.
Almost one in four believes that the conflict in Syria will worsen during the Trump era.
The views are divided as to whether the participation of Russia and Iran has improved or aggravated the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time coded to keep the Internet in order - the database he's developed uses, for example, Wikipedia and Google
MariaDB is developing a database of open source "the fastest growing in the world".
The main product of MariaDB, founded by the coder Michael "Monty" Widenius, is not paying users anything, and can be developed online by any good programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they are not necessarily paying customers.
The databases will help to keep enormous mass of data in order and quickly available.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they will use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in the image format comes from the database, and the images are also linked there," explains Widenius.
Widenius, the technology manager of MariaDB, spends about half of his time coded.
The man who works with beautiful hands will help to ensure that the internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database, MySQL, along with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun bought MySQL for a billion dollars, and one year later, the software left Oracle snuffed Sun for 7.4 billion.
When the Oracle trade took place, a large part of MySQL’s developers announced that they would leave.
"They did not want to work for Oracle, who did not promise the future of MySQL", recalls Widenius.
He had already set up a company that started developing MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired a couple of top developers from Sun to make sure that the code was maintained by the same friends that created it.
As MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
I just had to change my name.
A Foundation was set up to monitor the freedom of development of the MariaDB code.
"There were no such assurances made during MySQL," Widenius says.
Although many have heard of Widenius and MySQL’s billionaires, few Finns know nothing about MariaDB.
"For the last few years, our growth rate has been around 50% a year," says Kenneth Paqvalé, Financial Director of MariaDB.
MariaDB, which is focused on growth, is not yet making a profit, and Paqvalén is short-worded about the company's characteristics.
To this extent, she reveals that, during the current financial year, MariaDB estimates that she will receive orders for EUR 20 million.
As the database is free, the company has developed services around it, of which business customers are ready to pay.
MariaDB also helps to exchange databases, which can be more than a year's work if the customer has used a closed database.
The exchange from MySQL to MariaDB will be possible in a moment, as they are versions of each other.
Among other things, the Spanish operator Telefonica and the largest bank in South-East Asia, DBS, are MariaDB’s paying customers.
The most popular cloud services such as Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, Albaban Cloud offer MariaDB to their customers.
At the same time, MariaDB is automatically spreading to new users in Linux operating systems distribution packages, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we're a small company, we have connections to the biggest players.
"Our clients include the world's largest telecommunications operators, gaming companies, banks and even some sort of central bank", Paqvalé.
The database market is still dominated by giants such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with closed databases.
Oracle is also modest from the branch business compared to the traditional closed database of the company.
Although Gartner claims that in recent years, the largest database companies have lost market share, players such as MariaDB, measured in turnover, are still insignificant, although rapidly growing, but they are still in the process of increasing their market share.
In the 50 billion-dollar database market, the open source databases do not even reach billions.
However, the weight of the open source code cannot be measured only in money, as most users do not pay anything for these software.
Gartner predicts that in 2018, companies are already developing more than 70% of their internal applications on open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been replaced or at least started.
Large companies will not receive new customers as the majority will next select an open source code.
This has led to the fact that license fees for commercial databases have jumped into the cloud.
Companies want to make as much money as before with a smaller number of customers", Widenius wonders.
Since the exchange of a closed database is difficult, the majority of customer companies have listenedly swallowed up the price increases.
"There are many customers to whom it is really difficult to move because their old applications and others are closed in a closed database," Widenius says.
He still believes that the customer's size is coming up.
When licence fees rise every year, the customer sooner or later enters the open source database.
The price is 10-20 per cent from the previous one, and the service is better, because the customer can easily switch to another database if they wish.
Moreover, many companies face major changes in the system when they transfer their functions to cloud services.
At the same time, many people change database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received EUR 25 million of loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the largest growth funding provided by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and is now planning to hire more people.
One reason for the EIB’s financing was the impact of MariaDB on public procurement.
The company has public sector customers, for example, in Britain and Germany.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros a year for databases.
"Many countries want to move to open source solutions and use tax money more efficiently," says Paqvalén.
Widenius regrets how money is spent in Finland, for example, on closed health care systems, when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say that an open source code is an ideology, but I think it's a better way to make a code.
The community is helping and doing something that it can't or can't do itself.
55-year-old Widenius is one of the most famous promoters of the open source code, along with another Finnish developer, Linus Torvalds, Linux.
Widenius helps other companies to develop operational business models on the open source code.
I continue to make 4-5 speeches every year around the world on this subject.
Italy tightens its attitude towards civil society rescues
Italy has warned NGOs which, on their ships, rescue refugees in the Mediterranean that they must not continue to operate unless they undertake to comply with the new rules on their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit to the new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to operate", Minister of Interior Marco Minnitti said in an interview with the newspaper La Stampa in Turin.
Minni's warning came the day after the Italian authorities seized the German Jugend Retett assistance vessel, which is suspected to have cooperated with human traffickers, which promoted illegal immigration.
Only a year ago, a relief organization refused to comment on the detailed accusations of prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us saving lives is and will be the most important thing. We are very sorry that we are not currently able to operate in the search and rescue area", the organization announced in its opinion published in the social media.
"We can only assess charges once we have gathered all the necessary information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Iuventa vessel of Jugend Retett since October.
The crew is suspected to have taken refugees directly to the ship by boat from the traffickers who got the boats back on board.
One such case is said to have occurred only a few kilometres from the coast of Libya, and the information is available from the prosecutor's document, the content of which has been published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected to have violated the Italian Coast Guard, which is overseeing rescue operations in the area, and is regarded as a motive for the zeal for assistance.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer to monitor their activities.
Only three non-governmental organisations participating in search and rescue activities have so far agreed to follow the Code of Conduct: Save Children and Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
which, on Thursday, said that they considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable, because they do not lead to "minor changes or obstacles" in the organisation's rescue activities.
Among those who refuse to follow the Code of Conduct are Nobel-winning Doctors Without Borders.
In turn, Minni pointed out that the number of migrants arriving in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks, which he considers to be an indication that measures to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors are starting to produce results.
"The last few days have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the Minister said.
He revealed that there is plans to continue this month's discussions with the Libyan mayors on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving for Europe.
The seasonal worker is suspected to have killed his step-mate in Enontekio, the suspect was found in the field, a case for the prosecutor.
The suspect's crime occurred in Enontekio Kuttäs last December.
According to the police, a Czech 36-year-old man is suspected to have killed his 26-year-old Scottish stepdad.
It has been said before that both were seasonal workers.
The police have also told us that after what they did, the suspect would have fled with two dogs into the country.
The man was found frozen in the field, and he did not make the resistance when he was caught.
We're gonna have to press charges in less than a week.
The case may still be put to death in Lapland district court during August.
Robert Hardy, well-known for Harry Potter and my All-haired friend series, is dead.
The British actor Robert Hardy is dead when he was 91.
On Thursday, his family reported the death of the actor.
Hardy, born in 1925, started his career as an actor at the theatre at the age of 24.
During his long career, he also played in movies and television.
Hardy is specifically remembered for the role of the Magic Minister Cornelius Toffee in Harry Potter's films and his veterinary role in my all-haired friend TV series based on James Herriot's book.
In total, the BBC’s popular series was filmed in seven places.
Michelle Carter was convicted of suicide-inspiring text messages
A woman in Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for text messages and calls that they thought she was encouraging the suicide of her boyfriend, Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, 20, 15 months in prison and five years in parole.
Carter was convicted of killing in June, and his boyfriend, Conrad Roy, committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
"My family is broken," said Conrad's father at the sitting on Thursday.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter applied for an appeal and had to wait for an application to be dealt with in freedom.
He was threatened by a 20-year sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy are suffering from mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red pants and creamy sweater, listened to his sentence with his hands crossed with a crying look on the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"He decided Conrad's life to heal his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the act," the prosecutor continued.
"He has shown no regret."
According to Carter's lawyer, the case was caused by "the shocking circumstances that Carter is deeply regretting."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz felt that Carter's "age or maturity level and even mental health problems had no significant impact on his actions".
The prosecutor read Conrad's mother's statement, Lynn Roy, saying that "it won't take a day for me not to grieve the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I can survive all this. I try to comfort his sisters in this pain we will always bear."
Conrad's sister, Camdy Roy, told the court that she was "only" about the idea that she would never see her brother's wedding and not be aunt to her children.
"It's painful to lose someone who's been in my life every day since I was born.
The case seems to be a precedent, because there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that incitement to suicide would be a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a car with a poisoning in 2014.
The case attracted national attention when it turned out that Carter had inspired his boyfriend to commit suicide in his text messages.
I don't know, there are many ways," Carter wrote in many messages that he had sent to Roy in the last two weeks before this death. Roy was on vacation with his family.
Just before Roy's suicide, Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention with Roy's death, and the judge ordered Carter not to benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has shared the views of the experts.
Only a few have defended Carter, one of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of the murder of his British roommate in Italy in 2007.
The Los Angeles Times published Knox's paper saying, "Michelelle Carter needs compassion and help, not jail."
Secretary-General NATO: Between Russia's worst since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg commented on Thursday.
Mr Stoltenberg accused Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than ever since the end of the Cold War, Mr Stoltenberg said at the CNN interview.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we would seek close cooperation with Russia.
However, especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and due to the continued instability of Russia in the eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to acting so as not to tighten up the tensions.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we will be able to engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid aggravation of the situation and a new cold war.
Before Mr Stoltenberg's comments, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, was able to say that the U.S. and Russia were at even a dangerous low level.
Mr Trump called for the countries to thank for the poor, poor Congress, which approved the new sanctions against Russia last week.
Audi is making changes to 850 000 diesel engines due to the setback experienced by car manufacturers
The day before the Audi announcement BMW offered to update more than 350 000 car software.
The manager of BMW said that "there are even more sensible alternatives than driving restrictions", he referred to European cities, including the city of BMW in Munich, which consider restricting or prohibiting the use of diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday Daimler announced changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies were talking about recalling.
European car manufacturers have strongly marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to meet the CO2 emission targets.
Nitric oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The cost of installation of emissions neutralising equipment will increase, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are strictly monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of contributing to large car companies and of ignoring problems.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's flaws, and Volkswagen installed scamming devices on cars that reduced emissions to the standard of the tests.
Many Volkswagen leaders have been prosecuted in the United States, but their actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former thermodynamic director of the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Zachheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be handed over to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a crime investigation into Volkswagen, and the authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in its cars to circumvent European emission standards, based on a similar study in the United States.
The audit of the Audi can significantly undermine Volkswagen’s position: the manufacturer of luxury cars has a disproportionately high share of Volkswagen’s profits.
The vote in Venezuela began with a false investigation, with a great deal of protests.
According to the company, the number of voters announced by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of real voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a company that has no role to play in the election results, the president of the National Electoral Commission, Tibisay Lucena, said to journalists.
Maduro assures us that the crisis will end
On Sunday, in Venezuela, a representative was elected in a controversial vote, which is intended to amend the Constitution of the country.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and has organised protests against its amendment.
The opposition against Maduro has delayed its own demonstrations so that they are in progress at the time of appointment.
According to El Pais, on Wednesday night, national security forces began to take over the country's parliamentary building.
The task force is to ensure the safety of the appointment.
Climate change threatens Provence lavender
The lavender has become a symbol of the South French Provence region, but now it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender had decreased due to droughts and insects carrying diseases. Researchers and farmers are trying to find a solution to the problem.
"The lavender is directly at risk in the area of Provence because it has suffered the effects of climate change in recent years, with a clear reduction in the rainfall in spring and in autumn in particular," says Eric Chaisse, a specialist expert at the CRIEPPAM research institute in Provence.
"This will shorten the life of the lavender.
In addition, drought has brought in a lot of small clusters that spread microbacteria."
The stakes are tough.
lavender oil attracts tourists, and it is also a highly desired ingredient of perfumes and cosmetics.
"We now have smaller flowers, which are weakly developed or weakened or lacking entirely," says Chaisse.
"In other words, there are fewer essential oil-containing parts."
The solution is sought by improving irrigation, by slowing soil humidity and by spraying plants with a mixture of clay and water, and by developing more sustainable varieties.
The reporter's murder represents a growing threat in Mexico.
The delivery of the Riodoce newspaper once a week usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss the latest cases of organised crime, corrupt authorities and endless drug war in the State of Sinaloa.
Today, however, we are discussing security because of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been asked to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists will discuss which is safer: leave the children home or take them into the delivery of the grenade strike in 2009.
The safety experts have written three words on the board at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask journalists for names for each group. There is no need for evidence, observations and feelings are sufficient.
They write down the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists who are suspected to be on the government's or drug cartels' paylists, criminals who make Mexico's chaos life-threatening.
According to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012 under the protection of the United States of America, 589 journalists have been subjected to attacks and threats.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder of the Riodoce, supplier and source of inspiration.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote together about many books on drug violence.
He is deeply missed, even though he is present everywhere. The front door of the Riodoc building is covered by a huge image where Valdez shows a middle finger. The picture says "Justice". The 30-year-old journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in T-shirts decorated with Valdez's smiling face. Valdez has glasses and a monumental hat.
The meeting will be held less than two months after Valdez's death, and journalists will discuss their common trauma, their nightmares, their insomnia and their fears of paranoia.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor's office was set up, in particular for the handling of reporters' cases, but according to the supplier's protection committee, only two prosecutions have been brought.
Journalists are rarely tried, as are thousands of drug-trafficking and organised crime-related murders only rarely end up in court.
The editors of Riodoce are going to continue writing about the violence in Sinalo, even though they are broken by grief and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security conference is of little benefit because the killers are not known and there is no hope for justice.
"This meeting is, frankly, a waste of time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know why."
Valdez had been removed from the delivery of Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan on 15 May 2017.
He had only driven a couple of blocks of his red Toyotas when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and shot twelve shots. The number is supposed to be related to the magazine's name: Riodoce means twelve rivers.
The shooter drove off in Valdez's car and crashed it some way away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She died of a wife and two adult children.
The rumors move fast, and they walk freely in Culiacan.
However, Valdez's death is a mute silence.
Sinalo has been Mexico's bloodiest battlefield since Guzman was arrested last year and banished to the United States in January. Competitive groups want to fill the void.
In the streets of Sinalo, one or more people are shot to death every day, and there are two-storey, decorative tombs of drug barons in the cemetery that are larger than many homes.
In the state on the coast, there is “peace” when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and director of Riodoce, a 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez, feels guilty that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes led to the murder of Valdez.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damascus Lopez, leading a competing group that wages war against the sons of Guzman.
The case could have upset the boys of Guzman: customers who suspected members of the gang bought every issue of the magazine as soon as the newspaper came to the sales points.
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper published by the same case was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues were no longer afraid for him.
He had made a long career in Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to set up a Riodocen with five colleagues.
In Sinalo, "it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem," says Bojorquez.
In time, the magazine began to feel brave and honest about its activities, and its sales and advertising revenues increased.
Journalists appreciated the possibility of publishing a high - quality research journalism without fear of censorship, and readers fascinated articles that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its establishment, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for her news in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez received the International Press Freedom Prize of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists for the courage to follow the story of drug trafficking in Mexico.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to go on with my life," he said when he received the award of the Journalist Protection Committee.
In Sinaloo, the drug deal is "lifestyle", Valdez said at the Rompevieto TV interview last October.
"The worker must accept a mission falling upon him – or act stupid.
I do not want anyone to ask me where I was when death was sown here – why did I not tell you what was going on?"
The people of Riodoce need Valdez — a joker who cursed like a port worker. They need a friend who always received hugs and advice. They need a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He always used a bonnet hat.
He went to the other side of the delivery at the El Guayabo bar and sat at the same table all the time.
Now they're asking if the routines came to his fate.
The death of a colleague has also led them to consider how best they can do their job and stay alive.
"The criminals do not like it if we deal with their women and children in our cases and their clean business, their secret drug trafficking runways.
They were left out of business," Bojorquez says.
In the best case, it meant strong self-defense and self-protection;
trusting in your instincts.
If you feel like everything's not right, you have to stay away.
The problem with the Riodoce journalist Andres Villarreal is that "the impression can be deceiving, and this happened in Javier's case".
The old rules no longer apply in Sinalo, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas,letteruz,Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought into the room where Riodoce's security training was held. A few days earlier, it had become apparent that only the spying programmes sold to governments had followed activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two policemen had applied to cover the tree’s shadows at 40 degrees Fahrenheit.
The state government had ordered them to guard the Riodoce premises located in a four - story building in the middle-class Culiacan region.
Some journalists were half-played as to whether these two policemen belonged to the 50% that the governor of the state did not believe was reliable.
It had been months since journalists visited a mountainous countryside dominated by drug gangs.
This week's issue of the delivery of Riodoce was about three major cases.
The size of the boxing, Julio Cesar Chavez's brother was killed in Sinaloa.
The magazine also intended to reveal that the government’s spending of money was concentrated in the governor’s hometown.
In addition, one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, just a block away from the D.A.'s office, had been kidnapped by a group of people.
There was no official information on who had been kidnapped and how, so there had to be careful progress: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was in favour of both drug traffickers and authorities.
The reporter found out from public documents that the restaurant was registered in the names of a powerful institutional revolutionist (PRI) politician, who has managed Mexico's policy at all levels for almost a century.
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in cases of much publicity.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous cases in the same place, one of which was the son of El Chapo Guzman who managed to escape and avoid the army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that they were receiving reliable information from the Valdez column about the kidnapping.
"In the past, we would have known what had happened," says the 46-year-old Villarreal, who has been given the nickname "El Flaco" because of his tender body structure.
"Now all contacts with our sources of information are broken."
Valdez's office has been transformed into a warehouse where anti-disaster signs and stickers are kept. The press workers have received a new, unexpected task: they have become activists for freedom of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took a few signs with him when he left the next morning to represent the local Public Prosecutor’s Office for an protest caused by another journalist’s murder.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michhoacan three days after the murder of Valdez.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found that was Adame based on DNA tests performed by the authorities.
Journalists have started to protest more loudly throughout the country. In demonstrations, the "SOS Press" texts appear on the sidewalks and in the buildings.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to get international support for the investigation of the Valdez case.
The day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez met the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists because they were telling the truth.
Since then, he has asked that he be removed from government cases because he is concerned that he cannot be objective in his anger.
Valdez had repeatedly found that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, by the authorities allowing crime, and by an indifferent society.
In its latest book, Narcojournalism Valdez writes that drug gangs are killing journalists, but they are also being killed by the order of politicians and security forces in agreement with organised crime.
According to the Articleiculo 19, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were made by the police and the authorities.
"In Mexico people are silenced by killing," Ramirez says.
Murders have a debilitating effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern Tamaulipas border state six years ago.
There was a message signed by the Zetas Cartel by his body, "I'm here because of my writings."
Next to his cut head, there was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some of the magazines have decided to cease their activities, such as the El Norte newspaper in the north of the Chihuahua border state after the murder of correspondence with Miroslava Breach in March.
Some continue their activities, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, even though its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a message to drug cartels on the front page: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their states or the whole country.
It's a tough decision.
It is difficult to find a job in exile, and you have to be careful all the time.
Sometimes criminals are searching for a reporter, as apparently happened to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in a apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he had fled from the city of Kiracruz.
For those who continue their work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra, who was to become a poet, admits that writing about drug trafficking scares me.
"I became a reporter because Mexico is on its way to hell," he says.
A short time ago, on Friday night at midnight, the editors of Riodoce sat in front of the delivery on the sidewalk beer when the latest issue of the magazine had been completed.
In the shooting between rival gangs and security forces, 19 people had died in Mazatlan beach accommodation.
The war accelerated, as was promised by the cartel messages found in the area.
Journalists put news on the Riodoce website on their smartphone.
I had to put the homepage back on the next day.
The sirens were in the vicinity — another shooting attack.
Bojorquez looked into the delivery of guarding police officers:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
The delivery of Riodocen continued the tradition of a murdered founder of the magazine under this massive portrait, where a man would show the middle finger to the whole of Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says that you can't even consider stopping the action. "How can I stop the paper when our intern asked you to get out on the street the same day Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Mannise's Olympics project began with a huge setback on "The Hard Place"
In April, Hannu Manninen’s festival, which was 39 years old, remained short, as the professional pilot began to prepare for the Olympic Games.
However, the exercise period began disastrously when Manninen was infected with the flu.
It started with a long period of illness that lasted for almost five weeks.
In practice, May went completely ill.
At first there was a flu, and finally there was a pediatric disease like an ear infection I had to eat antibiotic.
I was only able to do 10% of the scheduled exercises.
I can't remember the last time I've been so sick for so long.
It was a tough place when I didn't get any more practice, and Manninen tells Ilta-Sanome.
The test result collapsed
In June 2007, the world champion received a training permit only in the second week of June, which was seen in the competition and top sports research centre in KIHU’s roll-over test.
In the test, the athlete skis with rollers on a mat, whose speed is increased every three minutes.
After each three-minute period, the carpet stops for about 10 seconds, and the tester takes a milk acid sample from the athlete’s fingertips on the needle.
Last autumn, I took 32 minutes on the carpet, but now I only stayed 28 minutes.
He came against the wall, Manninen tells me.
In a better direction
Well, after the initial rights, Mannine says she's still healthy.
I have done a wide range of peaceful aerobic exercises that I have tried to normalize the body’s metabolism.
Now there's a really good five-week period behind.
The tour was also a week and a half away from flight duty.
I also had time with my family to go to the cabin.
Last season Manninen took part in only four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Cup.
The best result was immediately seen at the opening competition when Manninen rose on the top-notch bridge at 18.
Directions drawn
Main coach Petter Kukkenen of Manninen and the national team has made a training and competition plan up to February.
We are now seeking a different rhythm compared to the last season.
After the first games, Ruka would have three World Cups weekend.
In December, the intention would be to attend at least one World Cup weekend, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January, plans would still have to be part of Seefeld.
I hope after that we find the name on the Olympic Team's list, Manninen says.
The Olympics of Pyongchang would already be the sixth Winter Olympics of the career for Mannis.
Now, the most important thing is to stay healthy, in Salt Lake City in 2002 in a gold team contest, celebrated the nummelian underline.
Dinosaurus was protected from his enemies by masking
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now scientists have revealed the first research results of a creature of the size of a Canadian miner that was so well preserved that the experts called it Mona Infantry of dinosaurs.
It had been preserved so well that the researchers were even able to determine that its bluish skin was red and had a 'problem past'.
According to Current Biology, it is the best preserved, armored dinosaur and the best representatives of its species in the world.
The recently discovered fossil is a nodosaurus, which lived during the middle stages of the Union period 110 to 112 million years ago.
Scientists consider this amazingly well preserved fossil to be a truly remarkable discovery.
According to the National Geographic magazine, an armored vegetarian is the most preserved fossil of all time.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium Mine in North Albert, Canada on 21 March 2011, and was found by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that did not seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely at its finding.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrrell.
For six years, the beast was dug out of a ten - pound block.
The results of the hard work are now available.
"If you lose sight, you can almost believe it was sleeping," says science writer Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at Tyrrell Royal Museum.
"It remains the history of the dinosaurs Mona Lisa, one of the most beautiful and most preserved dinosaurs.
Skin studies found that the dinosaurs eating meat were likely to be a significant threat to this vegetarian, even though it had a armor and looked like a walking tank.
Its red - and - white armor masked its predators, and was also protected by a darker and lighter coloring, still occurring in many animals.
According to the experts, it was better able to blend with its environment and avoid its enemies, larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million - year - old nodosaurus rose to the headlines in May and is now exhibited at the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrrell.
Researchers have named it Boreaope Markmichelli Museum Engineer Mark Mitchell. Mitchell was part of a team that took over 7,000 hours to dig up a dinosaur.
The Nodosaurus has remained so amazingly well that Mitchell and the international team of scientists have been able to determine its body scales and shape.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by a general coloring, in which the body is darker and lighter than the body.
However, the observation was a surprise because Boreaope is significantly greater than the present - day animals with similar coloring.
From this, it can be concluded that dinosaurs eating meat caught it to the point that evolution favoured survival rather than battle as a means of survival.
Of the animals present, for example, the peuros, the zebras and the armadillos have the same coloring; they are significantly lower and therefore easier to catch, suggesting that the nodosaurus was seriously threatened.
"The prey of a large, heavily armored dinosaur tells how dangerous the dinosaurs of the covenant period were," Brown says.
The chemical analysis of the nodosaurus Finns reveals that its skin was red.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaur in order to draw conclusions from its life, including studying the contents of its intestines to find out what it ate with its last meal.
Scientists believe that when it died, it fell into the river and drifted into the sea where it sank on its back to the bottom of the sea.
Alberta was as warm as she was today in Florida, and the rivers and seas were likely to reach much further than they are today.
"This nodosaurus is really important, because its natural skin has been preserved and has also remained three-dimensional in its original form," Brown says.
"That's why it looks almost the same as in the early accession period.
It does not take much imagination to imagine it: if you shake your eyes a little, you can almost believe that it was sleeping."
The premise was the era of teropods, huge two-legged, meat-eating dinosaurs.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, or millions of years earlier, Borealopella, may have been preying on this armored dinosaur by its mighty predecessors.
The predecessors of Tyrannosaurus Rex included, for example, the Acrocanthosaurus, a six - ton monster about 11.5 meters long.
The latest findings of the Nodosaurus scientists are published in Current Biology, and they believe that Boreop washed himself up after his death and mummyd himself into the mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium Mine in North Albert, Canada on 21 March 2011, and was found by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world's best preserved armored dinosaur with its skins and armored pieces to the hip.
The Nodosaurs were on average five metres long and weighed up to 1,300 kg.
Two-and-a-half-metre spikes were lifted from their stage.
Researchers believe that this armored vegetarian passed through the present Western Canada until the flooded river transported it to the open sea.
Its armor has preserved small details in a marine grave.
Its fossilized remains have been preserved so well that its skin remains in the hollow plates of the armor along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine that this kind of survival is "a rare victory.
The more you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
There is still fossilised leather in its skulls of the skull.
Its right front leg is on its side, five toes up.
I can count the knots on that foot."
How did an activist learn to answer the question: "Who is the street?"
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on 9 August 2014.
He had arrived a day earlier in New York from his home in St. Louis and sat on his airbnb apartment on the bed, browsing Facebook on his phone.
That's when he noticed a message from his high school friend:
"Police just killed an 18-year-old kid, and his body is still on the street."
Confused, he noticed that no one else had posted the same information on his feed, which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous retwiss from @TheePharoah.
The user name is one of the rappers in St. Louis who, in real time, reported Michael Brown's death, who had been shot by a white police officer in a state of Missouri by an unarmed 18-year-old black-old Brown.
This user had also posted a picture of Brown’s lifeless body on the street where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone away, and when he got back to Twitter later that night, they told me people were gathering for Canfield Drive.
The users posted pictures of the police's lock-up and screaming people, and Brown's father, of the man who claimed himself to be the father, who, on the sign, said, "Ferguson's police just killed my gunless son!"
Ferrell followed a real-time video of a police officer standing in front of the protestors with a barking dog.
He also tells me he saw a video where another police officer set his rifle and shouted, "I'm gonna kill all of you... animals."
"This isn't normal," Ferrell remembers he said.
"It wasn't the kind of murder we're used to and could be called typical.
That's when I felt the chills.
I was angry and crying."
He booked a return flight home for the next day.
The plane landed at 11:00 p.m., and Ferrell went to pick up his six-year-old daughter's father and decided to leave for Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next almost three years has been the documentary film "Whose Streets?". It received its first night in film theaters on 11 August 2017.
The film is a story of survival and expression of mind, love and loss, as well as strength and perseverance from the point of view of the local people who went to the streets to ask for answers.
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson with his daughter, who was dressed in a crown, they again discussed "what it was like to live black and in what conditions". They had spoken countless times before that morning.
"Do you remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things they believe?" Ferrell remembers saying to his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't be without my daughter," Ferrell told me later.
"Events of today are the climax of events of the past.
My daughter has the right to know it and to grow into it.
He must be prepared to activism and organize himself, but he must also feel the different layers and circumstances of the experience of black living, and he must know what we must do to be free, to free ourselves.
Although I am fortunate to have been able to protect him from gross racism, he is still the same as other black girls.
I feel like I'd hurt him if I protected him from reality."
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, located across the police station. It became the camp of activists, waiting for information on the case and finally finding out that there would be no prosecution against the police.
There Ferrell and his daughters went to help the local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to protestors.
Ferrell started to take a new approach to activists.
"Activism changed completely after August 9th," he says. When he studied at Missouri University in St. Louis, Ferrell was the chairman of a minority health care student's organization. At that time he focused on food law and health differences in black communities.
"I had no experience in organized organization.
Somehow it just happened."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, assistant director of the document at the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and the photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar 'wanted simply to tell' what was happening.
Ferrelli thought of being suspicious, and she said, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story you can use?"
The suspicion was based on the countless times that people had appeared in the local community, usually white people who only wanted to benefit from its difficulties and perseverance.
"We had heard that the people who were born and raised in Ferguson had no common voice," Folayan said in the interview recently. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted Damon Davis, assistant director, who is known for his activistism in the hands of prisoners sentenced to death.
Davis' involvement led Ferrell to join the project together with six other locals, and the description team followed events in the years following Brown's shooting.
"This is not a document in which someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we speak for us," Davis says.
"The most important thing to me was how local people are presented in a movie because I'm presented in the same way."
According to Folayan, the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience, because it was intended to show that the public movement 'is not a charismatic leader but a community'.
That is why the document sees as surprising private parts of Ferrelli’s life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I felt pretty naked", Ferrell laughs when he told me what it felt like to see the movie for the first time.
"But I understood that this work and the human characterisation of blacks require a certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's story once again brings back the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter.
The movement was born in social media (#BlackLifesMatter) after the police shot a black teenage boy, Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement are identified with a queer identity.
"The leadership of black queer women has kept up the whole movement," Ferrell says. "It's because we have to fight constantly on many fronts.
The black queer women have had to endure everything."
Mr Folayan agrees: "The black women who really maintain movement, including many queer women".
He stressed, however, that Ferrelli was not chosen for "self-intended" due to his queer identity.
Folayan says.
"It is no coincidence, however, that he was at the front line. Black queer women live at the point of many things, and they have a lot at stake.
"His energy is transmitted from the white fabric."
The film groups of the news have left Ferguson a long time ago, but the relationship between the community and the police remains tight.
Ferrell still has two and a half years of parole left, and he was convicted of blocking the freeway in the demonstration.
His description of the social policy environment in his home corners is short and concise: "Mustration."
Yet he still trusts the slogan he learned outside on Ferguson streets three years ago:
"Our debt is to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains."
A suitable similarity: the artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman Gallery in New York has hung face – white, black and brown face in the middle – between which you can see a similarity.
These 30 works are portraits by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples of Fort Leavenworth prison, where he served 35 years in prison. Manning was sentenced to leaking classified diplomatic wires to the WikiLeaks site.
Dewey-Hagborg's Becoming Rememblance exhibition was opened on 2 August 2017.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in its work. Manning is a trans-national and careeral dissident whose sentence was reduced by Barack Obama on the third day of his term of office.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzes Manning's DNA algorithmically and created 30 images based on his genetic data. They are a sharp, albeit slightly theoretical, statement on the modification of DNA data, on multiple interpretation and on the underlying causalities and identity.
Chelsea Manning, born in Bradley Edward, has openly stated that she has identified herself with women since the break-in, who was found guilty in 2013 of 20 crimes, including fraud, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning sentenced to prison: a glazed, black-and-white selfie, where the troubled Manning sits in the car at the driver's seat.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had a very popular Stranger Visions project that he carried out in 2012.
That's where he created portraits based on forensic data, and he got DNA from, for example, tobacco jams and gums, and he created images of what the people involved could have looked like.
Then the artist got an e-mail from the Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their story," Dewey-Hagborg reported a new exhibition at an information conference.
He couldn't visit Manning, and he couldn't be photographed in prison, so the paper contacted Chelsea and asked him if he was interested in making a DNA image of Manning.
The artist and his captured muse suddenly became correspondence mates, and they wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even made together a Advanced Images comic book, which was pictured by Shoili Kanungo. It described a future in which the president would ease Chelsea's sentence and he would be able to see the exhibition.
In fact, Obama shortened Manning's sentence only a few days after the publication of the comic book.
It is also impressive that the exhibition is being opened right now when Donald Trump is fighting his own war against informants and transgender soldiers and discovers new ways on Twitter to strengthen the powerful divers that he was actually supposed to ease.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "all have a purpose."
On the wall of the gallery there is a statement by the artist and the great title of Manning, with the heart at the point of the last name i. In its opinion, the artist calls for the end of the "automatic division based on sex, race, sexuality and culture".
The opposite wall has a Manning DNA sequence: a long line of C, G and A letters written on a pencil.
With this 200 letters – or nucleotide, as is the scientific definition used by the artist – Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we all are, at least from our biology.
"I hope that my show will help people to understand that we are equal to our genetic heritage and that genetic data are very personal and open to interpretations," says Dewey-Hagborg.
" DNA tells countless stories, 30 of them are here."
The last work of the exhibition is in its own room: page from Manning and Dewey-Hagborg comic book.
That's where Manning's character rises from prison like King Kong with a megaphone in his hand.
"If they can get you quiet, they've won," the picture says.
"Don't ever shut up."
"The text is from a letter I received from Manning," says an artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive I still get cold colors."
Unlike the comic book, Manning has not yet seen an exhibition. When Manning shows up, he is greeted by faces based on his own genetic data as a group of protestors in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is deliberate, as is everything else in this exhibition: for example, the Manning DNA sequence is written with a pencil to a height that is the same as its length (157.5 cm).
"The cats used to be on the wall, but I wanted to make them feel like a crowd," says Dewey-Hagborg.
"I wanted to describe Chelsea's mass movement, which was also behind her release."
Professor of Northwest University and employee at Oxford University are wanted for murder.
The police report that they have launched national searches to find a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who is suspected of stabbed a man to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
The Cook County Court documents show that arrest warrants were issued on Monday from Wyndham Lathem, 42 and Andrew Warren, 56, suspected of being involved in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to a local bulletin published by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27.7.2017.
Policemen alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with multiple scar wounds in his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene of the incident and the stab was investigated as a murder, and the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as Deputy Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at the Nortwest University since 2007.
In his e-mail opinion, Vice-Rector Alan K. Cubbage, responsible for the University's social relations, said that Lathem is now on administrative leave and is forbidden access to the campuses of the Northwest University.
"This is a criminal case that the authorities are investigating, and the Northwestern University is helping with the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
An e-mail from the University and Somerville College informant states that "we have been in contact with the police in Great Britain and we are ready to help the US investigation authorities in all possible ways."
The opinion also stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and hoped that he would surrender.
Anthony Guglimi, Head of Information at the Chicago Police Department, said that he urged suspects to give themselves to the authorities.
"Polices have an idea where they are, and we keep on focusing our search for them," Guglimelmi said.
According to Guglimel, local, regional and national authorities will assist in the search for suspects.
He said that the police received a call from the host of the Grand Plaza building, which had received an vague indication that something had happened in the apartment of 1008.
The police described it as terrible at the scene.
According to Guglimel, it is unclear whether the victim had been murdered on the same day or earlier.
He told me the security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," says Guglimelmi.
The Grand Plaza Board of Directors published the following press release: "Police is currently investigating the progress of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
He threatened to blow up the Islamic bookstore and kill the Muslims in London.
"I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm a Catholic," the convicted said to the police.
Moffatt must provide 100 hours of unpaid social services.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of his threats to blow up a Islamic bookstore in London and "kill all Muslims."
According to the Independent Journal, David Moffatt was convicted of serious harassment, among other things.
Police say they were alerted by the bookstore staff on May 23rd.
According to the staff, the man had been "intimidated to blow up the bookstore and kill the Muslims."
The suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffatt was captured when he called the police about the threat.
The threat had nothing to do with what happened in the bookstore.
The authorities found that Moffatt was dressed in the same uniform as the suspect in the bookstore, the police informant.
I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm a Catholic, Moffatt told the police in interrogations.
The penalty is to provide 100 hours of unpaid social services and to pay GBP 620, i.e. about EUR 690 and GBP 85, i.e. approximately EUR 95, for victims.
According to Scotland Yard's informant, several hate crimes are not reported.
"We will complete the actions of the WADA Road Map in the near future" – Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Vitally Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitally Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the work under the WADA Road Map of the World Anti-Doping Office to restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission, RUSADA.
"Some of the measures under the road map have already been implemented, and RUSADA was entitled to design and test in cooperation with UKAD, the UK Anti-Doping Commission of the United Kingdom.
The WADA road map has been updated in this regard", Muko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA Road Map, which lays down the conditions for the restoration of the powers of RUSADA, which was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to the formula, it contains nothing worrying about Russia.
"All have been announced, and everything will be carried out.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future", Mutko added.
One of the points on the road map, however, requires the Russian anti-doping authorities to publicly accept the results of the investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, appointed by the WADA. McLaren investigates the alleged contribution of the State to the Russian sports doping.
To that, Mr Mutko said: "The research is under way because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no state programmes and we cannot admit things that did not exist."
In the words of the Mutko, there were echoes of the opinion of Vitaly Smirnov, Chairman of the Russian independent public anti-doping committee.
Smirnov, who spoke to the Russian RSport Sport Media on the same day, admitted that there have been problems in the Russian anti-doping bodies. "We have said several times that there have been controversial positions and regulations in the report.
We are not going to adopt the report unconditionally," he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to cease its doping control in Russia in November 2015, after the doping scandal had been revealed.
However, last June it was authorised to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
In July, the leader of WADA, Olivier Niger, visited the headquarters of RUSADA in Moscow. After his visit, he noted that the organisation was "on the right road" towards the restoration of powers.
British sceptical about the dear innovation of Finns: There is no evidence of the health benefits of maternity packaging
The British organization has doubts about the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
Among other things, the BBC and the Guardian report that the Lullaby Trust, which is fighting against conjugal deaths, prohibits the use of its own brochures in maternity packages distributed in Britain.
The distribution of maternity packages to all pregnant women will start this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some areas.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that maternity packaging reduces the risk of death.
Cod death means the baby's inexplicable sudden death.
Lullaby Trust acts as an expert in the health authorities of Britain in the safe area of a child’s dream.
We will no longer allow our official brochures to be packed in them because it would allow us to understand that we recommend this product, the organization informed us.
Finland is one of the lowest child mortality rates in the world, only two dead per thousand born.
According to Lullaby Trust, good reading in Finland is the result of many different reasons, such as a small amount of teen pregnancy.
There may be one factor in giving each family a box.
However, we cannot say for sure, Mr Bates, CEO of Lullaby Trust, said.
We are concerned that maternity packages are marketed as products that reduce child mortality and death.
The maternity package is a Finnish invention and has been given free of charge to all mothers in Finland for 80 years.
The packaging contains a variety of items, such as children’s clothing.
This year the packaging contains 53 products.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box in which the child can be put to bed.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes it distributes meet all security standards.
Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says that there is no security standard for cardboard boxes as a place to sleep.
According to Lullaby Trust, the packaging can be the best option for sleeping if there is no room or bed.
The organisation recommends using the pack only for daytime sleep and stop using it at the point when the child is able to turn around.
The organisation also recommends keeping pets out of the packaging and making sure it is not wet or dirty.
Vikkela's frog ran away from another Japanese zoo
The Japanese zoo staff are looking for a deported turtle.
The giant turtle has surprised the staff at their speed and has already escaped twice in two weeks.
The race ran away from the Shibukawa zoo in Okayama, western Japan, on Tuesday morning.
The security cameras revealed that the frog left the zoo through the main entrance.
It will not die immediately because it eats grass around the zoo, but we are very concerned about Yoshimi Yamane, who works at the zoo.
The runaway 35-year-old frog is female, 55-pound and about a foot long.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During opening hours, the frog is allowed to walk freely in the yard area.
The zoo has not received any witness sightings from the turtle.
The last runaway trip to Konna happened the other week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking down the road 150 meters from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane told me.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups help your company avoid errors with Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in her online shop startup, but the questionnaires did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even misleading.
Although he assured us that the questionnaires were anonymous, some workers were suspicious about them.
"The questions were simply not consistent or objective," says Errett. His hair care company, Madison Reed, focuses on e-commerce. The company has 75 employees.
He decided to turn to outside help.
New types of personnel management start-ups have become increasingly available to help other companies find out how their employees can.
They develop and license software that can measure employees' commitment. Companies can make surveys and target specific teams and population groups and provide anonymous reporting services to their employees and, in some cases, direct contact with the government.
"My health can be followed by applications such as Strava and Fitbit, but where is Fitbit?" asks the founder and CEO of the Glint Startup in Redwood City, Jim Barnett. Glint provides companies with analytical software to measure employees' commitment.
Errett has been using Glint's software for three years, and he tells us that he has gained a deeper view of the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
In addition, you can create a map that can see with one eye where workers are more dissatisfied and which leaders have received the weakest estimates.
Businesses have understood that they must follow the workplace culture so that they do not become the next Uberia. The transport company has been surrounded by chaos since the former employee wrote in his blog about a culture in which workers are being persecuted and punished for their problems.
For start-ups such as Glint, such omissions are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance are a global industry whose value can, according to Let's Talk Payments website, be higher than $ 118.7 billion by 2020.
In Denver, the state of Colorado, Convertcent is a startup that helps companies to detect and prevent inappropriate behaviour. Interest in the company grew earlier this year when Uber's reputation hit.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It's also recently concluded a deal with Uber.
Like Glint, Convertcent allows companies to make custom-made surveys, collect answers in a confidential way in real time and map problem areas.
In addition, employees may report inappropriate behaviour anonymously by means of a text message.
And if there is reason to doubt the manager, then the complaints go directly to the company's government.
"The public opinion has cast aside the authorities," says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
He points out that if a company treats its employees badly or does not work ethically, the consequences can be costly even if the authorities do not intervene. Consumers can start boycotting the company and it can also lose the workers and become tried.
Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has over 25,000 employees at 500 sites. The company has used Convertent for more than a year because it wants to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and can easily contact the headquarters.
In the past, the practice was that if an employee wanted to report the problem, he had to first find out the phone number or email address that he was able to report to the head office. Then he had to make a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
"It was often a scary and unpleasant experience," says Ruby Tuesday's Law Director James Vitrano. According to her, it was difficult to follow complaints made by employees.
In the past, problems remained hidden from leaders in another city or state, and now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
"I have a more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the reality of the employee," says Vitrano, who is leading Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"We will also protect our shareholders from labour-related legal proceedings."
According to Quinlan, the companies started to take ethics, values and employee commitment more seriously after the audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of an ethical activity in connection with the Enron scandal.
It was only with social media that the companies realized that they could no longer prevent the public investigation of their dirty goods.
"The hope was used as a strategy before technology came to ethical control," Quinlan says.
Glint and Convertcent offer their software as a service that is regularly charged for its use.
It is a business model and an opportunity approved by equity investors, both Glint and Convertcent have the support of equity investors.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which has raised a total of $47 million in capital.
In November, Glint received EUR 10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners and has raised a total of $60 million in funding.
Investments are not a surprise given the links between companies, business culture and venture capital.
According to several studies, workers expect more jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as the hidden valley, good wages and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel accepted and appreciated and to give their time to a genuinely useful company.
"Workers are more committed to the success of the company if they enjoy the company and feel that they are being listened to and that their work is rewarding", says Nina McQueen, director of LinkedIn, which is responsible for the remuneration and well-being of workers.
Investors will be able to make a profit when companies succeed, and companies will succeed when employees commit themselves.
Third-party analytical tools promise to strengthen workers' commitment, so it is no wonder that they are interested in investors.
According to experts in the workplace culture, knowledge of workers' commitment is important,
but it is useless if it does not lead to measures being taken.
If the company requests feedback from its employees, it can be considered as a sign of change.
And if change does not come fast enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce the commitment of workers.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you must be prepared to hold four thousand discussions," says Russell Raath, Director General of the management consulting company Kotter International, who has seen companies rely too much on gathering information.
"If the company fails to take action, the workers will start to wonder if they have been heard.
and whether their opinions matter.
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company?"
According to Hirett, Madison Reed is currently conducting monthly personnel surveys and is able to tackle the problem on the same day as announced in Glint.
After collecting feedback on the slowdown in decision-making and the quality of communication, Errett was able to make changes to the teams and organise communication training to solve the problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help it to improve the long-term sustainability of staff in an industry known for the high turnover of workers.
"If the company does not commit itself to creating a culture of transparency, it loses its employees," Vitrano says.
"If it loses its employees, it also loses its customers.
And without customers, there are no companies."
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of smuggling his naked female neighbor, reports TT.
A woman living in Gothenburg had come out of her home in the shower when she noticed a cell phone hanging outside her window at the end of the string.
The woman said the cell phone camera shot her in the apartment.
The woman who was scared of the incident had run into another room to dress.
When the woman arrived to check the situation, her cell phone was pulled up first, but soon after that she was counted back into the window.
A 20-year-old man who's suspected of shooting has admitted he's been shooting a woman.
But he said he only photographed the woman's face.
The video on the cell phone had been deleted, and the police had failed to return it as evidence.
In the hearings, a man has admitted to the act, but has denied to commit a crime.
The man he described was justified by saying that he loves his neighbor as "the crazy one."
According to the News Office's TT, a man will be charged with the case.
Teachers demand more liquefy during autumn negotiations
The wage developments cannot be lower than, for example, the export industry, but the difference should be narrowed, said the President of the OAJ, Olli Luukkainen, on Thursday.
The temporary operation of public sector holiday funds highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to conclude agreements in which the review would in no way have involved holiday payments.
In the municipal sector, contracts should only be concluded once the private sector papers have been signed and the percentages of increases are clear.
For example, a large-scale predictor predicts that the working conditions of the OAJ have been agreed in January.
The percentage targets were not yet revealed by Luukkainen.
Mr Juko, who is also the chairman of the public-trained negotiating organisation, is a strong leader.
Luukinen: Holiday cut increases income differences
According to the OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of the public sector's employees is declining, while at the same time the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to the group, fixed-term cut-offs further exacerbate income developments.
Finland must determine how many pupils per teacher can be:
OAJ also points out that the equality of basic education must be ensured, as the best and weakest-sufficient differences are constantly growing.
According to the organisation, learning outcomes are decreasing, and differences between pupils and regions are constantly increasing.
The day of Bruins' players was prolonged when the N.C.A.A.A. reduced daily exercises to two.
It's almost 11:00 a.m., and a group of UCLA football players have stayed to talk about campus training on the other side.
Some of them have taken off their toy shirts, and their backs shine on the sweat after the first day of the training camp.
For quite a few of them, this few minutes of talk is a midday break.
At the university's summer classes, students return to the dormitory after three hours of training and the next morning they will meet at the Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 p.m.
"The next three days will be rough for these guys," says coach Jim Mora of Bruins shortly before Monday's switch to Tuesday.
The university's roofing organisation reduced the number of daily training sessions to two. The aim of the change was to reduce the number of players, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the final final tests will be held.
That's why the first three exercises at UCLA started 15 minutes later than seven nights.
This year, the camp started almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time in the training period of Westwood, which continued through the 6th of Mora, when the exercises are held at the same time as the summer courses.
The exercises are scheduled to be held 18 times before August 20th, when the actual preparation for the season opening will begin: UCLA will meet the Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says she supported the N.C.A.A. rule change, even though it made the players' schedules even tighter.
"We're gonna load them a lot for three or four days, and that's very challenging," Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work. They're great friends.
I think it'll make things easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA will close the exercises after the camp. It is not easy given the direct view of the parking area next to the training fields and the Luskin Center, a high-level hotel that has already been bombarded with football flying over the protective net behind the finish line.
The Bruins players are due to move to the hotel next weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when rooms are available from outside.
"We have security arrangements," Mora says.
"The problem is that people can book a room and shoot exercises on video from there. It is not an excessive concern.
You pay quite a lot for the video from the exercises.
But we have guards there and in the parking lot.
We'll do our best.
I'm not going to bother my head too much.
We have a plan."
Freedom to Rwanda
Presidential elections will take place in Central Africa on Friday, whose winner is already seen as clear.
Paul Kagame has formally sought for his third period, but in practice he has contributed to the country's leadership since 1994.
That was when the rebel group RPF ended the genocide organized by the extremes.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
Kagamea has been criticised, among other things, for crushing the opposition and for restricting the freedom of the word.
He has also been accused, for example, of distorting the statistics on poverty.
For the third period, Kagame will have the opportunity to seek because the Constitution, which has been confined to two periods of presidency, has been amended.
However, Kagame is also a genuine leader in Rwanda.
In his time social reforms have been carried out in Rwanda and international investments have flown into the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in bringing together a land divided by genocide.
Rwanda's success has led many Africans to ask whether a liberal multiparty Democrat is the right model for African countries.
However, Kagame too has promised his people more freedom after the country has been lifted up.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook fights fake news by improving the control of facts
Facebook intends to send potential false news to independent fact-verifiers more and more often, and to present the results below the original article.
The company published on its website a statement that it will start using updated machine learning to identify false news. Possible false news will be sent to the fact-finding authorities and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticised for being one of the biggest spreadrs of false news. Many believe that false news had an impact on the outcome of the US presidential election in 2016.
The subject has been raised to a political debate in Europe where French voters were bombed with false news before the May presidential election and the German pre-election for the September elections supports the plan to fine up social media networks if they do not quickly remove hostile content.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate opinion published in Germany that the verification of the facts would be tested in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"The people want to see which stories do not cross the board of independent inspectors. They also want more background information so that they can decide more clearly what they read and share", Facebook news feed product manager Sara Su wrote on the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue testing the subject-related articles and will make other changes to its news feed to reduce false news.
The birth of a comic book: The story of a castle
A small Scottish castle in Kent County is now known as the Squeeze music video and Margaret Thatcher's hideout from the 1970s and 1980s.
Now this castle in the river valley of Bewlin is the subject of the comic book, written by Jamie Rhodes, a moped-haired writer who has a favorite place for old documents.
"I think it's great to be able to study the text written by a person who died over 300 years ago," Rhodes says horribly.
"I feel a personal connection when I hold the letter in my hand."
The book Rhodes, A Castle in England, tells stories of the families living in Scotland from the Middle Ages to the EDARDian age. Each story is pictured by a different artist, a promising British cartoon artist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes's first book based on archives. In 2014, he published Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, which were inspired by the documents of the British National Library. The project was emotional.
"I moved in tears when I saw a thumb print in the letter. The letter had been written by a double agent working for the Jacobs in the 1700s," Rhodes says.
"It was his print!
And the letters smell like smoke, because at that time fire was used as a lighting.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel that he is on the spot.
I love archives!"
The author who was attracted to old documents was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Council of Arts, which seemed too good to be true.
He spent the days studying the Victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures and rareties, such as the hyena heads hanged on the walls and hundreds of bottles held in the moor.
He toured the ruins and farms of the old castle and discussed with forest guards, gardeners, and sometimes also with artists who picture the book.
At night, he "get the whiskey and started writing".
Scotney's closer history is quite unknown, as the castle was transferred to the National Trust Foundation only after the last heir Elizabeth Hussein died in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the Foundation’s staff was just about to begin a archive breakthrough. Rhodes describes that archives had been kept for hundreds of years by the same method: taking all the extras to the attic.
The archives contained journals, letters from the time of the British Empire, and maps of who owned what. "You could imagine that land disputes are boring," Rhodes says. "But here the families were fighting for even one birch.
I thought I'd let it go."
Some of the books are going from the castle to the history of England, such as The Labourer, which tells about a man who shortly after the castle was completed in the English peasant rebellion in 1381.
"The Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex says there was a riot in the castle in 1380," Rhodes says.
"The English peasant rebellion began in the same area, and it occurred to me that the rebellion could begin out of a riot.
Maybe these events are connected to each other?"
Other stories of the book are closely related to the history of the castle — such as The Priest, the story of a priest hidden by Darrell’s family for seven years during the Reformation of England.
The Smuggler tells the story of the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 17th century. He is said to have staged his own funeral by filling the coffin with stones (it was noticed years later when his grave was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotland. "The men of the family seem to have been a lot of weirdos.
The men of Darrell's family solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women, seeing them as handsome friends who knew how to lighten the heiress."
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about Life Mountain, a healing home in the early 1900s, with only a euphoric plot left.
Scotland Castle has a special place in his heart.
"It was sad to leave," he says.
"I wouldn't have wanted to go back to this damn business."
Between Russia and the worst since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg commented on Thursday.
Mr Stoltenberg accused Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than ever since the end of the Cold War, Mr Stoltenberg said at the CNN interview.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we would seek close cooperation with Russia.
However, especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and due to the continued instability of Russia in the eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to acting so as not to tighten up the tensions.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we will be able to engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid aggravation of the situation and a new cold war.
Before Mr Stoltenberg's comments, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, was able to say that the U.S. and Russia were at even a dangerous low level.
Mr Trump called for the countries to thank for the poor, poor Congress, which approved the new sanctions against Russia last week.
Vladimir Klitshko finishes the rematch against Anthony Joshua.
The long-term heavy series of occupational trafficking, world champion Vladimir Klitshko, will finish his career.
Ukrainian Klitshko, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
In the Atlanta Olympics 1996 Klitshko, who hit gold, fought as a professional 69 times, winning the games 64.
He held various MMs in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost two last fights in his career.
Tyson Fury scored him in November 2015.
In April of this year Klitshko met Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost after a wild fight in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitshko were expected to face a rematch in Las Vegas in November.
However, Klitshko did not find any motivation to the fight.
I deliberately took a few weeks to make a decision to get a sufficient distance to the Wembley game, Klitshko told me when he announced.
As an amateur and professional insurgent, I've achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I could never have imagined that I would have such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
See Klitshko’s reasons for its decision on the video.
Bernd Bönte, Klitshko’s manager, reported in a statement that the termination decision was difficult for Klitshko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he does not have enough motivation.
That is why this is definitely the right decision, Mr Bönte said.
Klitshko has been dating Hayden Panttier, an American actor since 2009.
The couple has one child, a daughter of Kaya, born in 2014.
Klitshko's big brother Vitali is also the former world champion of the heavyweight series.
In the years 2008-12, the brothers managed the World Trade Organisation's MMs at the same time.
The weather breaker in Finland spells out the conditions: "Take it from the file"
Sailing jumper Minna Nikkanen has suffered from conditions during the summer's outdoors.
Minna Nikkas has had a situation.
The wind and the cold have taken away a woman's file.
Even in London's World Cup, there are unstable conditions.
Minna Nikkanen speaks the weather.
The circumstances have been this summer against the Sailing Jumper Minna Nika.
I don't want to blame the track, but it was inconceivable that I couldn't even get the little poles to move properly, Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I've competed and practiced here on a number of occasions and I've never experienced the same variety of winds in this place, Nikkanen told me about Paavo Nurm Games.
During this period, it has been very difficult to standardise the jump, even when there have been such unstable winds in the exercises, Nikkanen said in Kaleva's competitions.
The weather was also spoken in London on Thursday.
It's been quite a challenge to get the technology together. Whether it's cold or not.
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken away the file.
It doesn't make sense to consume energy in a bad situation.
He made it to the World Cup thanks to his 455 jumps.
It's 445 out.
The situation in London isn't the same for everyone.
We have to be cool and wait for better winds.
The aim is to exceed Friday's reduction of 460.
Why don't you move to practice abroad?
It's not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany.
I was able to get a jump and standardize the technology.
I guess I should have done the same thing now.
Normally, they've been able to practice in the hall, and now the hall's been closed.
What would it be like to race?
Twenty-five degrees hot.
Just as long as it's standard.
An experienced ex-office officer snuffed politicians at Yle: "We have no room for division now and for many years"
Despite the favourable economic climate, the government of Juha Sipila has to keep the ice on the hat and watch out for the expansion of the state budget with debt money, warns Erkki Virtanen, who has been preparing the budget for decades at the Ministry of Finance.
He says there's no room for sharing.
Üle interviewed Virta, who lived in 2015 in Wednesday's 1st Samu.
Construction of the state budget next year is about to begin.
In recent times, political proposals have been brought up, for example, on the increase in the guarantee pension, on the calculation of car tax and on the support of electric bicycles, which Mr Virtanen has been holding as electoral speeches.
They mainly tell us that the elections are beginning to be close, because when 10% of the state budget is financed with additional debt, we have no room for allocation now or for many years.
I think it's even a treachery to talk about division when you take your debt, and Virtanen told Yle.
Virtanen stressed that all debts were due to children.
Virtas has a long experience in the preparation of state budgets: in 1978, he started as the Secretary of Budget at the Ministry of Finance and then worked as Deputy Director and Budget Manager of the Budget Department.
Last time he retired, he served as head of the Office of the Ministry of Employment and the Economy.
Mr Virtanen pointed out in the interview with Mr Yle that the expected 3% economic growth is likely to be temporary.
All fortune tellers estimate that this is a thorn that is going to go down next year, and Finland is expected to grow by one per cent for decades.
Washington is changing the rules on a permanent residence permit.
According to the media, President Donald Trump stated that the rules of the permanent residence permit, Green Card, will be amended by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, to tighten the requirements of temporary work permits and to limit family visas.
The Republicans have proposed new rules, and the President supports them.
The draft law is to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars in taxpayers' money by changing the way permanent residence permits are granted to citizens of other countries.
It will also reduce chain immigration and replace the current programme.
The new search process will benefit applicants who know English and are able to support themselves and who have skills that benefit our economy," Trump said according to the media.
The wife of the queen of Denmark does not want to be buried in the same place as the queen.
Prince Henrik doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margareta.
In the picture, Prince Henrik and Queen Margaree were photographed in April.
The queen of Denmark, Margareta, 77, and her spouse, Prince Henrik, 83, are not buried next to each other, says the Danish court.
Traditionally, rulers in Denmark have been buried in the same place.
The King's House has announced today that Prince Henrik does not want to be buried in the Roskilde Court of Judgment, the Court notes in its announcement on Thursday.
According to BT magazine, the reason for this is the prince's dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
There is no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his role and titles in the Danish Monarchy, the Court’s Head of Communication, Lena Belleby, commented in the newspaper.
The decision for the prince not to be buried next to the queen is a natural consequence of his being not treated as equal to his mate.
According to the court, the queen has long been aware of her husband’s wish for the burial place and will understand the decision.
A terrible moment on the road: The car was on the freeway.
Tom was carrying a common-lawed and two small children.
They were not injured in an accident, but they will not receive any money from insurance if the other party is not reached.
The accident happened at Keimolanport in Vantaa.
Archive photo of the construction site of Kehä III.
The Vantaan Tommi reports that his family survived a miracle trade in a car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, her cohabiting partner, Riina, and the couple’s two small children, were on the freeway at Keimolanport, in the direction of Hämeenlinna.
From District III’s connection to Hämeenlinna Railway, the white car that was to drive to the side of the family’s car,” Tommi says.
If it hadn't been for the evasive movement, the car would have turned on Tom.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it's out of hand, Tommi tells me.
The family car hit the rails at a high speed.
The parents and two small children in the back seat were not injured.
One child is slightly less than 3 years old, the other one is less than 1 year old.
I guess it was pretty lucky when nothing happened to us.
No one in the past even drove us, even though there was a busy traffic.
The accident happened at about 5:20 p.m.
According to Tom, no one stopped at their place, and the family called 911.
They got out of the car by themselves.
The ambulance and rescue staff arrived, and the family's condition was checked.
The car was fixed.
Tommi tells her and her cohabitant have low incomes, and they received family allowance for buying a car a few years ago.
Without the details of the other car, the family says Tom doesn't get money from the insurance policy.
That's why the family wants witnesses to see the car that led the family to the hive.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take kids to the yard and go to work without it, Tommi says.
Tommi saw the car was white, old-fashioned.
It was probably from the end of the 1990s or the beginning of the 21st century.
He thought the car registration number was the beginning of SIG.
If we can't catch the guilty person, I don't know how we're doing financially, we're gonna have to count every cent now.
Tommi hopes that what's happened or something about it will be connected to the police.
The police station in East Uusimaa and the Central Uusimaa rescue unit confirm that they have had an accident on Tuesday night.
The title and case were fixed at 21.15: Unlike what was originally told in the case, the second car, according to Tom, did not come from the incoming strip, but was to drive from the acceleration strip to the side of the family car.
The performance directed by Lotta Jäppinen deals with human relationships by humor - The self-discoverer will be seen at the theatre on Fridays and Saturdays
Lotta Jappinen, from Kouvola, brings her first-born director to the What? theater.
Self-discoverer is a performance of the music theatre wrong about past relationships and insufficientness.
The director, Lotto Jäppinen, still thinks it'll be a good idea.
The subject is addressed by humor.
Boring feelings don't go away, he says.
According to Jäppinen, a tour of the summer theater has been carried out with a pyjac budget and a large, young heart.
The name of the presentation is challenging to consider what a person reveals about himself when he becomes acquainted with a new person.
Is he pulling a role or is he approaching another coat?
An unscrupulous presentation confuses the fact and fiction
He's both directed and dramatised the show.
He's also responsible for the lights.
The proposal consists of the texts of the working group and does not have a plan.
The director believes that although the presentation draws young people’s minds, it speaks of those of all ages.
I would like to emphasise that the Self-discovery does not directly tell us about his or her personal relationships with the working party.
Fact and fiction mix.
I'm sure my own dignity will be ignored by the performance.
I don't think relationships are bad, but I don't think relationships, especially relationships, are a condition of happiness.
Many learn from divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that the Self-Detector draws a current picture of young adults living in Finland who are 100 years old.
According to him, many have learned a lot from their parents in human relations, many of whom have been divorced.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka are performing the performance.
The working group also includes dresser Ella Snellman.
Music atonement is Jäppinen and Rokka.
Love for the theater was set on fire in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, from Kouvola, 26 studying as director of the theatre expression at the Academy of Arts of Turku University of Applied Sciences.
It's two years behind, and there's another one in front of it.
A gradual enthusiasm for the theatre has begun during the Kouvolan years.
The student of the music classes has been an assistant at the Kouvola Theatre and has played, among other things, at the University Theatre in Helsinki and last time at the Linna Theatre in Turku.
The guidance has become increasingly interesting.
The self-discoverer got his first night last week at the Narrin stage in Helsinki.
At least in Jäppinen's city of study, Turku, the presentation took about 45 minutes.
Self-discoverer in Kouvola What? Theatre at 4.8. at 19 and 5.8. at 14 and 19.
For one year, a Finnish Olympic winner recovered from a terrible motocrossnetty - his neck broke.
Few athletes in Finland have the same unscrupulous force as Janne Lahtela.
In the ace of Kumpare, hundreds of days a year toured the world for a few decades and pursued his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but Lahtila’s movement continued.
He was not only a tireless intern, but also a tester of new species.
I don't think there's many forms of exercise on earth that a chemist would have tried at least once.
It's inspired to practice.
There's always something new, Lahtela tells me.
Finally, one hobby was to stop Lahtila completely.
In 2014, Lahtela suffered a motocross accident.
As a result, his neck and both hands were broken.
I wasn't working anywhere.
I licked wounds at my home for a year, says Lahtila.
The cell had bad luck.
He's also admitting that age could have had its share in the crash.
You know, driving a bike might sound crazy.
But I didn't go for borders with it.
It's only as a species so hard that a 40-year-old like this doesn't make too much use of it!
After the accident, Lahtela was in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
Behind was a long start as head coach for the Japanese freestyle country team.
Lahtala started in the pest immediately after his career ended in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be there.
I didn't really do much, Lahtela tells me.
Even during the training period, Lahtela often challenged her protector in the slope and in the physics tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was so physically and mentally tired that my own thoughts did not seem reasonable either.
Not even with the species.
It was good to be in place.
I actually enjoy it because for once, I could just be.
The compulsory break inspired Lahtila to become the Finnish Chief Coach.
Without stopping, he's afraid he'll be burned down.
It's easier to find places that's broken down than dead!
If it wasn't for the accident, I wouldn't have realized I needed so much rest.
Lahtela started the freestyle country team in Finland about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby to replace the drivers.
I switched the motocrosses to frisbeegolf!
I mean, it just left the shovel right away.
I was at my worst seven hours a day throwing.
Although Lahtela herself has always been a super-intelligent trainer, he does not require his training to be the same as he did.
I don't force everyone into the same fashion.
There is room in our species culture to be different and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and mentality has always been in line with it, Lahtela says.
Sex robots are coming and we need to be concerned.
It is here: a report on technological developments in the sex robotic sector – just as it started to feel that 2017 could no longer be more strange.
Yes, it is.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots within the next 5 to 10 years.
"We must start to take seriously the generalisation of sex robots," says the founding member of the Foundation and Emeritus Professor of robotics and Artificial Intelligence from the University of Noel Sharpey Sheffield.
Customers can choose the color of robot's eyes, the shape of nipples and the type of fingertips.
"Sex robots are being skimmed, but they're already sold quite a lot, and we're going to see them even more," Sharkey said at the press conference.
Sexy dolls have evolved from blowing dolls into robots with warm silicone skin and artificial intelligence characteristics that resemble human behavior.
The user can also adjust the robot’s preferences from the colour of the eyes to the shape of the nipples and to the type and color of the fingertips.
What is even more worrying is that robots have "personality" that makes Stepford's women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sexy animals have developed into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user’s preferences, perhaps shy.
The Roxxxy Gold robots of True Companion have preprogrammed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous and so on.
"Roxxxy Gold's personality is adapted as fully as possible to the user's personality", the company's website is advertised.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has a variety of moods:
It could be tired, with a conversational mood or a "in the mood".
There are many worrying features of the generalization of sex robots, which replace genuine human relationships, but even more dangerous is the subordination of women and direct rape fantasies, when the user approaches a programmable robot, for example, shy and resisting.
True Companion compares Roxxxy robot with vibrators on its website:
"Women have vibrators, why shouldn't men have sex robots?"
But sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex game.
Their generalisation and development is about one of our darker and deeper cultures: the decline in gender equality towards sexual intercourse, where subjugation is one way among others.
Of course, most men do not acquire sex robots, and their popularity remains marginal, even though the FRR report reported their growing popularity.
However, marginal phenomena tell much about the spirit of time.
And many begin to behave strangely or offensively only when the market authorises it.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have begun to become popular at the same time as women's rights are threatened around the world and there is a President sitting in the White House who has been boasting that he has been harassing women.
In the TV series The Handmaid's Tale (Orjattaresi) is not the most worrying image language of its strength, such as images of hanged bodies and excavated eyes. The most disturbing is how realistic the world feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
Sex robots are trying to make as much sex robots as possible (in terms of porn stars) as they can.
Robot developers want their skin to feel genuine and their movements to imitate human movements as well as possible.
But their "personalities" are far from reality.
The robot can't leave the relationship or the situation.
They have neither their own will nor their history — nothing to suggest independence or to violate the fantasy of complete submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Slaver.
Police suspect that two acts of terrorism were planned in Australia, led by Chief Isis
The leader of Isis, a group of Australian men, who are suspected of being involved in a bomb in the plane of Etihad Airways.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, a person of Isis’ leadership had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
It was suspected that the bomb was to be taken to the plane on July 15th, but the company was interrupted before the security check was carried out.
The police won't tell us why the company stopped.
The second plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a toxic non-coloured gas-disposing device and to bring the device into a public place, such as a public transport device.
Australian Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
As a result of the suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interviews continue.
The good side of the drum?
Makes Mitt Romney look like he's got a common sense.
During the Trump period, it has been repeated that families have also been demolished by the strong diversity of voters at everyday level.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, the American newspapers councils taught how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
They want us all to blow our information bubble.
Trump's ability to unite families has been neglected.
I'm going to tell you this because my cousin visited me this week in New York, a poet who lives in Chicago, a left-wing poet who's been in the middle of a long time with the Republicans of our family.
He recalled that a common enemy could have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all of my cousins – including the Republican sister with whom he has been arguing about politics for decades – are suddenly and suddenly on the same side.
At the dinner table, it is a good thing, but, more generally, it poses significant risks.
Trump has given the left a new flow, but the distortive effect of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization", we talk about the scary possibility that one day we won't be able to do any more of his tricks.
In the long term, there is an even more terrible possibility that Trump will normalize the Republicans of the right extremism, which suddenly seem reasonable compared to Trump.
As a shark, I think of Mitt Romney's controlled version of madness: a dog on the roof of a car, a 14 per cent income tax (and at least we've seen his tax returns).
Once the Trump era is over, the Republican next presidential candidate needs only to be clear, and it immediately feels like a remarkable improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our kid to Central Park's carousel, which is the biggest carousel in New York Park, and the best thing you can get in New York for three dollars without caffeine.
The horses of the carousel are huge, the characters in the middle — gruesome clowns and the animals that look back on the horror — are evil, and the screaming music in the background is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York’s characteristics are becoming disappointing over time: prospects of high buildings are getting tired, the city’s silhouette is getting too familiar, and the reality of the city is not in line with dreams.
And still, after 35 years, I have not fully overcome the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage but a large traffic circle in northern London.
The carousel of the central park, on the other hand, is still a strange magical experience — even to the extent that two two - year - old, eleven - year - old and two - 40 women enjoy it enormously.
I would have given the carousel the full score if someone had asked for my assessment, but fortunately, no one came to ask questions.
Instead, I was asked this week at the department store to assess my "payment experience" on a scale of one to five stars before I put my credit card on a reading machine.
It's the same thing in the cafe at home, but there I'm also given the opportunity to combine a 15% service allowance with an estimate when I go to the coffee counter myself.
This slows down everyday interaction and pressures the customer to put his or her personality in the game when it is not needed.
The dealer of the freight wheel smiled at a feeling of regret when I was tired of giving five stars to my credit card experience.
Shefki Kuqi got fired from the Inters, "There was no trust in the leadership."
The FC Inter has today released Shefki Kuq Society's representative team's duties as coach.
The coaching responsibility is taken by Fabrizio Piccare, who previously worked as an assistant coach.
Other training teams will continue their current duties.
The Italian Piccareta has previously served as an assistant coach in, among other things, English Sunderland.
In January, Piccareta, 51-year-olds joined Inter’s training group, has completed the UEFA Pro license last year.
Mr Stefan Håkans, Chairman of the FC Inter Government, regrets what happened.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the trust of the management of the company, when there was no alternative now, Håkans commented in the press release.
The Piccareta Agreement shall remain in force until the end of the period.
He and the rest of the training team will be responsible for tomorrow's home match against HIFK.
According to the data of the Night-Sanmies, the team's been running out on Thursdays.
On Thursday morning, Kuqi told the players that the club's assistant coach Piccare and John Allen have been moved aside.
Kuqi and Piccareta made a strong match against PS Kem last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius released a youth picture from the '80s, would you recognize a serious violin student?
The violinist Linda Lampenius published a youth picture on Instagram.
A number of cages have been added to the picture, making it possible to conclude that the musician is 16-year-old Sibelius Academy student.
Lampenius himself wonders about the young woman looking at the camera.
A long time ago, serious, he's communicating.
If you don't see the picture, you can look at it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and also talked about painful topics.
A fair year ago, he published a picture of himself in Instagram.
In the second picture he was seen 20 years ago, in the second he poses now, as the mother of two children.
In his illustration, Lampenius meditates on his own growth as a human and refers to eating disorders he suffered when he was younger.
Twenty years ago and today...
I still look much like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is, I've learned to like myself and what I look like, Lampenius wrote.
After the text he had added in English Hashtagit life, eating disorder, uncertainty, confidence, self-esteem, love himself, 1996, 2016, ageing, girl, woman, ageing is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his past eating operations.
He was already 14 years old at the hospital for anorexia and orthorexia.
A little later, he also became ill with his bulimia, which eventually was revealed only in 2006.
Healing began in a little bit of silence.
In addition to therapy and peer review, Lampenius helped with a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to the hospital because of chest pain.
This is the second time Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he was hospitalized for cuts on his wrists, which, according to the prison authorities, had been dropped in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after the defendant's initial conviction of murder.
He killed Stenkamp's Valentine's Day in his early hours in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he thought he was his girlfriend for a night-old intruder hiding in the toilet.
The prosecutors have told us that they intend to appeal again, because they consider Pistorius’s six - year sentence too mild.
The D.A. intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal may be dealt with already this year.
If the appeal is accepted, the judgment of Pistorius may extend to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in place in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece.
Two illegally encamped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs according to the BTV channel.
The police arrested a number of unauthorized campers in Sithonia on the morning of August 1, two Bulgarians among the campers.
They were released on the same day, but the case remains under investigation.
According to TV channel bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced that it had released the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free camping areas and already impose considerable fines on all those who camp in areas other than those reserved for purpose.
The checks shall continue until the end of the period.
The Ministry announced that the right may impose a fine.
Liquid stock sinks - already -7.7%
The share of the oil processor Neste has fallen by 7.7 per cent at about 11 a.m.
Its result before taxes fell, but exceeded the forecast compiled by Inquiry Financial.
The stock exchange trade has gone off slightly today, both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
Shortly after the opening of the stock exchanges, the large European Stoxx 600 index had gone up by 0.2 per cent.
The total OMXH index of the Helsinki Stock Exchange had fallen by 0.3 per cent to 9509.48 points after about half an hour of trading and the OMXH25 of the most traded companies had decreased by 0.3 per cent.
The total exchange rate for the stock exchange was EUR 41 million, nine million of which was the morning's resultant liquide.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like nightmares in the digestive system.
However, a recent study claims the opposite: diets with a high content of meat protein and dairy products may facilitate irritable bowel syndrome.
Irreversible bowel syndrome is an incurable disease involving about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300 000 people in Great Britain, causing abdominal cramps, swelling, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
People with irritable bowel syndrome are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products. However, Washington University researchers found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen the insulin tolerance.
According to the research director Marco Colonna, immune cells guard from the intestines and ensure that no harmful microbes hide in the food.
Cells that balance the cells that cause infection, which strengthen tolerance, protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to the inflammation, it may result in irritable bowel syndrome.
Studies have shown that immune cells that enhance tolerance are present in mice with specific bacteria in their intestines.
This bacteria requires tryptophan to produce immune cells. Tryptophan is one of the building blocks of the proteins.
"We found a link between the development of Lactobacillus reuteri and the development of resistance-promoting cells. Lactobacillus reuteri is part of the normal intestinal microbibe," says Professor Colonna.
"The more the mouse diet had tryptophan, the more they had these immune cells."
If the same thing works in humans, a combination of Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and a diet containing high levels of tryptophan can enhance intestinal tolerance and reduce inflammatory sensitivity.
When studying immunocompromised immunocompromised cells, Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one group of mice had such cells, they did not have the same species of mice that were kept separate from another group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the intestinal microbibes in mice, i.e. the normal gastrointestinal bacteria, fungi, and viruses in the community.
When the intestinal DNA of mice was studied, six species of bacteria were detected in mice with immune cells but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria were administered to mice that had no intestinal microbiosis and had no immune cell development, immune cells began to appear.
Researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system. They raised Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in liquids and transferred small amounts of liquid — without bacteria — from mouse to immature immune cells.
The immune cells developed into tolerant cells.
When the active ingredient was cleaned out of the liquid, it was shown to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the number of tryptophans in mice' food, the number of cells that enhance tolerance increased by about 50%. When the number of tryptophans was cut, the number of cells decreased by half from the previous one.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, people have the same tolerance-enhancing cells as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether the by-products of tryptophan from the Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria can develop cells in humans in the same way as in mice. However, genetic errors associated with tryptophan have been observed in patients with irritant bowel syndrome.
"We probably want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation on the internal surfaces of the intestines," says Cervantes-Barragan.
"high tryptophan levels combined with Lactobacillus reuteri may contribute to their generalisation."
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United got a "neron" after he made a deal with Nemanja Matic.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United got a "neron" after concluding a deal with Nemanja Matic. The midfield player debuted Manchester United in a match against Sampdor on Wednesday night.
In the final match of the United Nations in Dublin before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday, the Matic, who moved from Chelsea at £40 million, made an impression as a defensive midfield player against stars such as Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
But Matic was not yet in the best condition because he was not on the tour of Asia in the blue shirts before the beginning of the season. He was able to do only 45 minutes on the field – according to Mourinho, a change must be made before the beginning of the Valioliga era.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and thinking make him a genius – he has the natural ability to think football," says Mourinho.
"We'd rather help him be ready than later."
In addition to Matic, newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were also starting a game at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to slice his start-up collection for the beginning of the season.
This week, the Independent revealed that Mourinho wants three more players, even though the Society has already done an excellent job by getting three of the four players he has placed on the top.
"three out of four – we must thank the company for that," he added.
"I'm more satisfied if I get all four of them, but they did an excellent job."
The women in the volleyballs plagued Germany for two rounds.
The Finnish women’s volleyball team lost its fourth match in the MM-carsinta tournament directly to Germany from 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The German routine in the game is high.
A level playing game was held in every sector, Finnish head coach Tapio Kangasniemi reported in the release.
In the first two rounds, Finland kept its opponent in a tighter position, but in the third period, Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads the block.
When we played patiently and in certain places aggressive enough, we were able to play along, Kangasniemi said.
Piia Korhonen had the most effective 14 points collected in Finland.
Three out of four matches Finland will meet on Sunday in Slovenia.
Reuters: The Grand Judiciary has already sent challenges regarding the Trump Jr Russian meeting
In the United States, the great jury has been challenging Donald Trump Jr. and the Russian lawyer Natalia at the meeting of Veselnitskaya.
The large jury convened by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has already sent challenges regarding the meeting of Donald Trump Jr. and the Russian lawyer known for the Kremlin links, Natalia Veselnitskaya.
This is reported by the news agency Reuters, who at the same time confirms the information that Wall Street Journal had previously revealed on Thursday about the gathering of a grand jury.
According to Reuters, the grand jury has sent challenges in connection with the meeting between Trump Jr and the Kreml-related meeting of Veselnitskaya, which was held in June 2016.
Paul Manafort, then campaign manager of Donald Trump Sr, and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, present advisor to the White House, were also present.
According to Reuters' sources, the fact that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has convened a large jury in Washington means that the pace of Russian investigation is getting closer.
The sources add that Mueller wanted to assist the grand jury in investigating Russia’s involvement in the US presidential elections and whether Trump’s campaign or close association with Russia was involved.
The grand jury will expand Mueller’s rights to collect evidence, send challenges and force people to testify.
The large jury is a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
The grand jury will consider the evidence investigated by the prosecutor in the investigation and decide whether the case should be brought.
The British inventor microchiped himself to get home and into his car with a hand shake.
The British inventor has been the first to microchip himself in the whole country so that he can open the door to his home, get into his office and start his car with a swing of his hand.
The microchip is between the thumb of 33-year-old Steven Northam and the front finger. Now he offers service to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier by Northam's BioTeq technology.
Northam cooperates with Geoff Watson, a consultant at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Iran, to ensure that the microchip installation meets the medical requirements.
The microchip uses a technique similar to that used in microchips of cats and dogs, and it only takes 30 seconds to install it.
Northam’s attempt also makes the locks of houses and cars compatible with the microchip. One lock handling costs £300.
Northam is married, and he has one child, and he has installed microchip technology in both his home and BMW Z4 car, which starts when he puts his hands on the steering wheel.
The white house exhibit paid thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The White House's last decision to fly the Navy helicopter to the southern lawn of the White House to the American production event came to pay taxpayers $24,000.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D Helicopter is called Marine One when the President is on its way. It was an appeal at an event in the White House on 17 July 2017 in which American construction programmes were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials visited the products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter manufactured in Connecticut, the samples included a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a truck from Mississippi.
The White House Military Office had requested the helicopter's position only about 36 hours before landing on the southern lawnr's "exceptional" event, as shown in the documents of the Navy HMX-1 Helicopter fleet.
"I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of this, because this is an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility," the HMX-1 unit commander wrote in an e-mail to his superior, who is an assistant commander of the Navy Air Force.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive at the southern lawn at 7 p.m. and the event would begin at 3 o’clock. The helicopter would leave the site only after the field was cleared between 6 and 9 p.m.
The message also noted that if the departure of the helicopter from the White House would be delayed, another crew would be required due to the limitations in service times.
The original crew were in the helicopter during the time of the event, and the security personnel of the unit were at the helicopter when it was on the ground.
It is not clear from the documents received by the TIME magazine whether another crew was eventually needed.
The US Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 asked if there was a violation of the law.
"One of our questions was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act. We were told not to break," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you may participate," the assistant commander replied.
Made in America was the official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political shades.
At that time, the President spoke for the health reform of the Senate and for the looser regulation of the state.
The use of Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The Presidents must use them on their journeys,
but their use only for photographs is unusual.
Trump's actions attracted attention in February when Air Force One rolled the president's campaign in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticised the use of his predecessor's presidential plane on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which introduced products made from American workers from all 50 states," said Lindsay Walters, White House Press Secretary.
The HMX-1 unit crews regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and practice in the southern lawn to bring the President to the White House with centimeters of accuracy.
When Trump attended the G-20 Summit in Germany early July, HMX-1 performed 58 training landings for the White House.
According to one official, flights to Made in America were part of the crew’s monthly training quota.
The unit helicopters also flew 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support tasks".
According to the White House, the event did not result in any other costs for taxpayers.
Sikorsky's informant reported that the company was not involved in organising a helicopter demonstration on the south lawn of the White House.
HMX-1 has no record of flights related to the duties of the President and it is difficult to assess the costs of the event exactly.
According to the Ministry of Defence's hourly compensation for 2017 the level of compensation for the VH-3D Helicopter is $24 380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 unit documents, flights from the Quantico base to and from the state of Virginia to the White House lasted an hour.
According to the White House, the operating costs of the helicopter are clearly lower.
"The calculation of the costs for the payees according to the level of compensation is misleading," says Walters.
"The estimated level of compensation shall include staff, maintenance and many other so-called ‘sovereign costs’, which shall be taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to the study carried out by the RAND research company in 2015, the levels of compensation do not include personnel costs, but they take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, Sean Spicer, former White House Press Secretary, defended the use of the helicopter in the event.
"The idea is to introduce American production," Spicer said.
"I know that the Sikorsky and Connecticut states are very proud that they are involved in ensuring national security and thus employ probably hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think that, like most Americans, we are proud of helicopters and other military equipment for which many Americans have worked hard.
It is perfectly appropriate to bring that forward."
It is not certain whether Trump was in the helicopter during the event, but at least he sat in the driver's seat.
In a white house, Trump made a joke to the press about his own Sikorsky fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three."
The lightning hit the Vaasa track. They're gonna have to replace the trains with the buses.
The passenger train between the wall river and Vaasa is broken down due to a technical error, reports the Railway Centre.
For the time being, trains are replaced by buses.
The failure of the traffic control system caused the thunder.
In the morning, the railway centre did not have an estimate of the duration of the repair.
The Venezuelan State Prosecutor calls for the right to prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country
The Venezuelan State Prosecutor has applied for a court order that would prevent the appointment of a new representative.
The Venezuelan President, Nicolas Maduro, has announced that the representation elected in the vote last Sunday is due to be appointed on Friday.
In a controversial vote, a representative of the country was elected, which can, among other things, change the constitution of the country.
According to Attorney General Luisa Ortega, the decision on the prevention has been requested because of the suspicions of malpractice.
Ortega has also started a polling malpractice.
He appointed two judges after the fact that the British voting company had been informed that the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters announced by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of real voters.
Only the allies of Maduro were nominated for the representation, and the elected 545 members' representatives include the son and wife of Maduro.
In addition to changing the Constitution, the representative body can break up the Congress under the opposition and change the laws.
Maduro was described as a dictator.
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition considers the constitution to be a means of strengthening its position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called it a dictator.
The European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have, on the other hand, declared that they do not recognise the new representation.
Maduro claims that the new representation is a solution to the political and economic crisis in the country.
The unrest in Venezuela has been going on for months.
They've wounded a lot of people, and over 100 people have died.
Venezuela fell into the economic crisis after the price of oil fell.
Now many people can't afford food or medicines.
The opposition is also expected to take a stand on Friday, when the new representative body is due to begin.
A Russian man delivered by Finland was sentenced to 4 years in prison in the United States
On Thursday, the Minneapolis Court of Justice sentenced the 41-year-old Maxim Senah to almost four years in prison from being involved in a global computer scam.
Senah was arrested in Finland as a result of a US request in August 2015.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on vacation in Finland.
He was arrested by the Finnish border authorities when he was returning home.
Finland handed over Senah to the U.S. judicial authorities in February 2016, despite the Russian protests, reports AFP.
In March of this year, he was found guilty of computer fraud that had benefited millions of dollars.
Senah was given 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah will be deported after the execution of the prison sentence.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly accused Finland after the arrest and said that a man should not be handed over to the United States.
The opinion accused Finland and the United States of being arrested in Finland without Russia knowing about it in advance.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury that infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to fish for usernames and passwords.
The fraudsters then continued to use the data by directing internet traffic, which was used as a means of circling and spreading spam.
According to the Ministry of Justice's criminal department, the case shows that the United States is also capable of hunting other cyber criminals.
We have the ability and the desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, Blanco said in the press release.
Modified at 20.58: Correction of the name of the convicted person.
Narcos’s third production trailer: Pablo Escobar is out of the picture, so Cali Cartel will be in the top of Netflix’s hit series
Although Pablo Escobar's killer was exposed during Narcos' second production period, the Netflix series is definitely not over.
The Recycling Service has already confirmed that the third and fourth production seasons are seen from the series. The third-period trailer has been released, and it presents the new frogs of the series.
During the third period of production, the U.S. Narcotics Police DEA has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the world's richest drug trade organisation.
The four rubber uncles' organisation operates as a "as a Fortune 500 company", except that there is a little more corruption and violence from the authorities.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) leads the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) handles connections to Mexico, and Chipe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In a recently published trailer, Pedro Pascal is returning to Javier Peñana, recruiting US and Colombian policemen for the war on drugs.
The new faces include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
Narcos’s third production period begins on 1 September.
Kari Kola implements an exceptional work of light art in Paris
The Joensuun Light Artist Kari Kola (kuavsa) will carry out an exceptional work of light art in honor of the first day of Light set by the United Nations in Paris next May.
Kola makes a work of light art in Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The work illuminates the Fontenoy building of the UNESCO headquarters and the Globe monument on its front.
In my work, I want to emphasise not only the light but also the darkness.
Today, light pollution in millions of cities is a major problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
With the help of my art, I can raise the important things I have experienced to be visible in concrete terms, says the light artist Kari Kola of her work.
I am very impressed with the invitation to participate in the first international Light Day and bring light art into the theme day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola attended the opening of the The Year of Light in 2015, when she lit the day for the celebration of the Unesco headquarters.
I feel very privileged to repatriate my art at UNESCO headquarters, Kari Kola says.
The work may be expanding in a very significant way.
This will be announced later in the autumn, Kola will continue.
The aim of the International Light Day is to highlight the importance of light for mankind and to raise human awareness of the fields of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Light Day will be celebrated at the UNESCO headquarters in central Paris on 16 May.
Two men fought at the mall parking garage in Espoo
Two men had a fight in Espoo at the shopping center of the Great Apple parking garage on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute started when the other party accidentally drove in a prohibited direction.
There was an oral dispute between drivers.
A driver driving in a prohibited direction struck another driver, resulting in a collision with the hitter’s car.
After that, he hit a hit-and-run vehicle in the hood.
In the initial talk, the man has admitted that he caused the damage and did wrong.
Timo Soin's question mark-marked article: "After that there was a flood"
Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (uv.) published a blog on Thursday, a titled question mark.
The article is short, only two sentences.
In my time, the party grew from zero to thirty-seven representatives of the People's Party.
Then came the flood, now everything floats, Soini writes.
The text of Soin contains references to France in the 17th century.
It is known that King Louis XV or this mistress, Madame de Pompadour, used a flood comparison.
Depending on the interpretation, history's books have been left with the clues "after us a flood" or "after me a flood".
According to the UN, democracy in Afghanistan depends on the political role of women
The elections are only representative if they allow all members of society, including women, to vote, said the head of the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
The interim head of the UN Delegation, Nicholas Haysom, said that hundreds of women are on the stand for elections in the county councils, three women are seeking vice-presidentship and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overemphasised", Haysom said in his opinion on Wednesday.
The elections can be genuinely representative and credible only if women are fully involved and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
The regional council and presidential elections in Afghanistan will be held on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban has presented threats to elections at the same time as international forces are moving to an advisory role.
This year's elections are the first time that power is transferred from a peaceful democratically elected government to another government.
Haysom said that women's contribution will strengthen the democracy of Afghanistan.
According to the independent electoral committee in Afghanistan, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

The flooding of certain types of tourists is a threat to the culture of the region
The authorities consider limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
Local rage is particularly directed at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it "eat and Flee": only a few hours are at stake and the large crowds are rushing through the sights.
Venice has been stifled by busy day trips to tourists in the city.
It is difficult to move on narrow streets and the fine squares are so full of visitors that the inhabitants of Venice are no longer able to fit in.
They have been forced to move further and further away from the historic center, while hotels have been replaced.
The New York Times and The Guardian write about tourism problems in Venice.
The authorities are considering restrictions on tourist numbers.
They call the present phenomenon low-quality tourism.
When you arrive on a large cruise ship, you will be given two or three hours.
You follow the sign-up guide to Piazzale Romalta Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's Square, and turn back to describe the tourism which is taking place and causing problems in Italy's Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operation of the site, shops and workshops.
We need to maintain this part of the identity of the cities.
The St. Markus Square is also one of the most popular visitors to the historic centre of Venice.
On the side of the market, there is the church of St. Markus.
Local anger also mainly targets cruise ships.
There are only 50,000 local residents living in the historic centre of Venice.
In 1951 there were some 175 000 inhabitants.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Russians expressed their views against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has undermined their quality of life, destroy the environment, and drive the inhabitants away.
About 2,000 people leave every year.
If this continues, after a few years there will be no tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historic disaster, says Carlo Belrame who was organising the demonstration.
The equation is difficult because ships bring to Venice the income they desperately need and create the need for a number of jobs in different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, a solution has been envisaged for cruisers to go further from the historic centre.
In the opinion of Luciano Bortto, who lives in Venice, the situation would certainly change if the region of Venezuela, in which Venice is also located, would have more power to decide on its own matters - if not full autonomy.
Approximately 20-30 million tourists visit Venice every year.
Are you driving towards Kuopio?
High-speed traffic on the motorway
The motorway between Kuopio and Lake Siilinjärvi, on the northern road, has had miles of traffic at the time of return from work on Thursday afternoon.
The area is covered by motorway coating work, which slows down traffic, says Savo Sanomat.
There is a 50 km per hour limit for the data rather than a normal 120 km per hour limit.
Even in the 50-kilometre restricted area, however, transport had made progress on Thursday afternoon, at some places, however, at a practically rate of walking.
On Thursday afternoon, road work continued on the side of Lake Silinjärvi with the Revelation statue, or golden deer.
I get along well without that kind of attention.
A 23-year-old runner has had to see the curses of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has published great images of herself, among other things, in the landscape of the Grand Canyon.
Amalie Iuel, a Danish-Norwegian, has become a popular athlete in Norway today, not least because in March he broke the 26 - year - old Norwegian record in a 400-metre run around the cycle.
A month later, he healed the 400 - foot - long fence run in Norway at 55.38 C.E.
Iuel, who uses social media hard, soon after his record, found that fame and publicity had their shadows.
Apparently, men around the world began sending imagery of their sex organs to Iuel in the hope that a young runner would be interested in them.
Iuel was forced to close his Snapchat account outside.
I got a lot of "broken images" from people I don't know, so I had to change my account, and Iuel told VG.
In the VG interview, Iuel didn't want to identify exactly what kind of pictures he got.
I'm sure you can guess, Iuel was laughing.
It's nice to get feedback after the run, but I get along well without such a different kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother's a Danish, father's a Danish-Norwegian.
Iuel's family moved to Norway when Amalie was 2 years old.
When Amalie was 12 years old, the family moved to Namibia first for Dad's work, then Pakistan.
Then there were Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he exchanged Danish citizenship for Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains with the guidance of three trainers, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to discussion than the United States.
In the United States, trainers ask nothing but give orders.
In Norway the coach has much more time to deal with the athlete in person, Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norwegian records at 400 metres and 400 metres of fence.
The more footy snowboarder Janne Korve took his entire career to the stake-out... now he's in the World Cup: "It's nice not to hurt anything."
It's been nice counting since you haven't happened!
Janne Korpi, 31, among the most successful snowboarders in Finland, has been able to enjoy its beloved species again this season.
Last summer, the career extension was at stake.
The foot injury had forced Korve to operate on the table in January, and the leg did not want to heal.
The hand, too, had taken a hit at the competition.
In the summer, I didn't know what I was doing, whether the ferrying was going on or not.
The sponsors were broken and many things were open, Korpi says.
But that's what they say. It's the way things work out.
The leg got better, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood started to draw to the front again.
After that, the decision was easy.
I knew it by the time I first went to the snow.
I was like, "Damn, this is so much fun again, let's pull through again."
The basket was only able to count properly in September to October, but after a long landing, it has been a big deal to work out.
There's only a few races that Korpi's been around.
It's okay.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of skateboarding for Korvel.
I've never counted for one race.
I think it's frustrating to spend four years in a single game, and then you're in a fever that week.
I'm tired of thinking like that, Korpi says.
Today the Korpi race will be held in the halfpipe of the World Cup in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Although he is not held by individual competitions on board, he is always set on fire by heavy association.
According to the ears, the appreciation of the international skiing union's competitions has increased over the last few years, although some of the ferryers chose to be held at the same time as Norway's X-Games.
Yes, these are important races, the visibility is high.
However, I believe that appreciation always depends on the circumstances and level of the competitions.
Korpi is the oldest athlete of the 12-person team in Finland in Sierra Nevada.
The holes of the team, the 17-year-old Rene Rinnekoskimä and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are older than Korpa 14 years old.
It's nice to follow the way younger friends go.
I remember when it was at the time that everything was new and so sickly excited about everything.
It brings new power to itself, Korpi wonders.
I'm still on the front somehow, but by the way, I don't have that much power in my friends!
In the background of the boarding career, Janne Korpi has also built a different sport career.
The son of the director legend Pekka Korve has become addicted to therapeutic sport: the plateman has his own therapeutic horses for whom he is doing training programs.
When I'm on my way all the time, there's no time for it to be in the mess.
But every day I look at at at least the results of the food and, generally, some of the departures, Korpi tells me.
According to Korve, therapeutic guidance and therapeutic training are a potential career plan when the boarding career comes to an end.
I don't think I'm planning that far, but at least it's a likely option.
I feel like I'm studying it here along with snowboarding.
I'm trying to keep my time on the nerves and develop, maybe drive a little things out in the summer.
If it's my future profession, it's not hard to start when you're already inside the species.
This includes the Elitloppet therapy with the host Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The twin has rented a cruiser, which will be heading towards the Elitloppet therapeutic competition in Stockholm at the end of May.
Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to revive the old tradition.
The cruise has gone well into business, and people have been excited.
Now we're at the point where at least we're not going to fail.
There's a few more months left. Let's hope we can get the ship full, Korpi says he's excited.
The Attendo nursing home project for Kite has surprised everything
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new 41-place nursing home for older people to be built on Kite.
A good 1 700-storey building will be completed next summer on the other side of the health centre’s neighbor’s Healthway.
The general wonder of Kite is where the new care unit is equipped with customers, for now during Siu’s time many private nursing homes are experiencing client shortages.
Anne Flink Attendo, Regional Manager of Care Services, commented that Kite will have more demand in the future not only for options but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice works better, says Flink.
Last year, attendo purchased private nursing homes from Kite, Kanervikkola and Eerika.
The trade concerned business, but the real estate is known to have been leased for five years.
Flint says that Attendo does not have an acute need to move operations away from these facilities.
More on today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the McVitie's brand in Scotland.
The Trade Union is seeking confirmation from the leaders of McVitie's inventor for a long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
According to the GMB section of the British General Trade Union (GMB), the company has not announced its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
There are over 500 employees at the Hobnobs and Rich Tea factory and other products.
The Pladis company that owns the McVitie's brand said that it has invested more than £5 million in the factory over the last few years.
The company added that employees and trade union representatives will be "twiced first" if changes are to be made.
In its letter to the Executive Director, the GMB calls on the company "to respond to concerns that no funding has been allocated to the modernisation of production lines".
Drew Duffy, the GMB Trade Union, is very concerned that the factory manager is not informed of the business needs of Tollcross and the future investment plans.
"Families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce has been strongly concentrated in the local community and in the metropolitan area of Glasgow. The factory is a major employer in the area of high unemployment and low income.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and income and the increasing cost of living and the continuous reduction of production, Brexit needs a successful McVitie's production urgently."
According to the platform informant, the company had only received the trade union letter on the previous day, and the company responds directly to the letter as it appreciates the continuous interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, when we discussed a number of issues openly.
We discussed with our employees, among other things, the fact that, like other companies operating in highly competitive and uncertain markets, we continuously evaluate all of our business operations and operate in order to maintain our competitiveness."
According to the press, in recent years the company has invested more than £5 million in the Tollcross plant, in particular its production lines and the improvement of its operations.
"We are aware of the long history of the Tollcross as a production facility and we will certainly tell first employees and trade union representatives if we are to make changes to the operation of the plant."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's transfer three years ago?
LaLiga may regret her interest in Marco Verrat.
Mr. Paris Saint-Germain will not give up Neymar's goal when he paid £ 189 million to terminate the transfer agreement, but did the PSG warn Barcelona of a record transfer three years ago?
The sensational transfer is the most spoken-out event of the summer. The French League 1 football team is prepared to break the world record of the migrations. The previous record was less than half the size of the record: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a transfer amount of £89 million.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive football player in the world and also the best-paid professional athlete in the world, as PSG offers him more than £500 000 a week after taxes.
The source close to Barcelona tells us that the Society has taken very good care of Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the president of the PSG warn the football world about this transfer three years ago?
When Manchester City announced that he was interested in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelifi warned the best players in PSG.
"I'm not worried, because they know that if they're looking for our players, we're going to be their opponents and we're going to contact their players," Al-Khelaif said.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they search our players, they will have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have been guilty of this: it expressed interest in the PSG’s midfield player Marco Verrat earlier this summer.
The PSG made it clear that it would not allow an Italian to leave under any circumstances, and it might well be that Barcelona will lose its star player Neymar.

Now, the calls Trump made were invented by the White House informant, "I wouldn't say it was a lie."
The White House admits that two calls made by U.S. President Donald Trump never happened, reports New York Times.
The calls made by Trump, along with both the Mexican president and the leader of the Union of Scouts, have proved to be ingenuated.
The White House informant Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had been made.
But he said Trump wasn't lying.
According to Sanders, many of the leaders of the patrols spoke to Trump in person, and Trump had been talking to the Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, at the Hamburg G20 meeting.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty heavy charge.
Those conversations happened, they didn't just happen on the phone, but on the face, Sanders justified.
Talking to the Boy Scouts Arouses apologizing
On Monday, Trump told me that the Mexican president called him and told Trump that he had succeeded in eliminating illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto told us that few more will come across the southern border of Mexico because they know that the journey will in any case take place at the U.S. border.
On Wednesday, the Mexican government published a release saying that the call had not taken place.
On Tuesday, Politico published a perfect version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
That's where Trump cheered up his speech at a big meeting of the National Union of Scouts in West Virginia.
I got a call from the head of the scouts, and he said it was the finest speech they've ever had.
They were very grateful, Trump told me.
On Wednesday, the U.S.A. announced that it was not aware of any of its leaders' calls to Trump.
According to the press, Michael Surbaugh, the director of the organization's earlier statement, in which he had asked Trump to apologize to the scouts, speaks for himself.
Mr Trump's speech at the meeting of the Scouts' Association caused a great deal of horror, as it was exceptionally political in relation to the nature of the event.
Among other things, he heated the results of the Presidential elections last autumn.
