The members of the Wales Congress are afraid to look like fools.
Some members of the Assembly are confused with the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP, a Member of the Welsh Parliament.
Mr Kohu started with the plan to change the name of the representative body to the Wales Parliament.
Members of the delegation are concerned, regardless of the party population, that change can make them ridiculed.
According to a Labour Party representative, the group is concerned that the name "compared with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: twp means stupid and pwp means poop.
According to a representative of the Plato Party, the majority of the group is "not satisfied" and has proposed other options.
According to the Conservative Party's representative, his group takes the name change with a "open mind", but points out that the MWP word is a short literal spell for a stupid word.
In this context, the W-book in Wales is pronounced in the same way as the U-book in Yorkshire.
The Commission, which is currently preparing the legislative change necessary for name change, said: "The final decision on the titles of the members of the representative body, of course, belongs to the members themselves."
The Wales Administration Act 2017 empowers the representative body to change its name.
In June, the Commission published an opinion poll on the proposals, according to which the appointment of a representative as the Wales Parliament will enjoy broad support.
The Commission favours members of the representative body as their title members of the Wales Parliament or the shortened WMP, but the MWP option received the most support in the public opinion poll.
The members of the delegation are apparently proposing alternative names, but the lack of consensus can lead to a major problem for President Jones, who is expected to change the law within a few weeks.
The legislation on amendments also contains other changes to the work of the representative body, such as rules on the loss of representation and the form of the committee system.
At legislative level, Members of the Assembly may give their final vote on the title to which they should be invited.
The Macedonians go to the electoral urns in the referendum on the change of the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether the name of the country will be changed to 'Northern Macedonia'.
The referendum aims to resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece, a neighbouring country, which also has its own region called Macedonia.
Athens has for a long time reiterated that the name of the northern neighbour is practically a territorial requirement for its region and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO membership efforts.
President Gjorge Ivanov of Macedonia, who is opposed to the referendum, has said that he is ignoring the vote.
However, the supporters of a referendum such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev reason that change of name is simply a price to pay for EU membership and NATO.
St. Martins' bells are quieting down when Harlem's churches are living in difficult times
"The elderly people I've been talking to say there used to be a bar or church on every corner," says Adams.
"There's neither of them now."
He said that losing bars is understandable.
He said, "Meeting with people has changed."
"Bars are no longer common living rooms in the neighbourhood, to which people gather regularly."
In the case of churches, he is concerned that the sale of property does not carry as far as the leaders imagine, "and sooner or later they have returned to the base."
He added that churches can be replaced by residential houses and apartments that are not supported by the remaining shrines of the neighborhood.
"More people who buy housing from these buildings will be white," he says, "and thus they will rush the day when these churches will permanently close their doors, because it is unlikely that most people moving to these rooms will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black neighborhood - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins ten years later.
The original white Methodist Church moved out in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation acquired a building to own it.
St Martins took over the black congregation under the leadership of pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against the traders of the 125th Street of Harlem's central trading street after the opposition to the hire or promotion of those black men.
In 1939, when Father Johnson’s parishioners planned to rebuild, the fire caused a serious damage to the building.
Pastor David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor in St. Martins, proudly called the tower game "the watch of the watch".
The expert who played the Tower game in July called it a "cultural treasure" and "unreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world’s first tower bell game played by a black musician. It was Dionisio A. Lind, who changed to play a bigger tower game for the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martins didn't replace him.
In St. Martins, we have developed a complex range of architects and contractors who have been hired by church laymen and the episcopal divers on the one hand.
In July, Saikasa - a governing body of laymen in the congregation - wrote to the skirmishes that the skirmish would "wirl the costs" to the sakas, even though the sakaskas had not participated in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the skirmish.
Some in the congregation complained about lack of transparency with regard to the hippo.
The shark damaged a 13-year-old humbersman in California.
The authorities tell us that the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him when he dived into the lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack took place at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before seven in the morning.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB TV that he and his friends had dived on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard the boy cry out for help, and he and the group made noises to the boy to help with the water.
Hammel said he thought he was just excited when he caught a lobster, but then he realized that he was screaming, "I was bitten!"
I was bitten!'
When he reached the boy, Hammel says that he found that his whole clavicle had been torn open.
"I told everyone to get out of the water: there's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is said to be critical.
The species of the hit shark is unknown.
At the media event, Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said that a shark had been observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found to be a harmless species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured in his upper arm.
The authorities closed the beaches from Casablanca Ponto Beach to Ecinitas Swami for 48 hours for scientific and safety reasons.
Giles pointed out that there were more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them were considered harmless.
Sainsbury's going to United Kingdom Beauty Care
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams in the department of beauty care, which serve expert advisors.
It is a significant movement for a United Kingdom beauty treatment worth £2.8 billion, which continues to grow, although sales of fashion and household goods will deteriorate. In 11 stores, 11 shops will be tried and, if they succeed, will be extended to other stores next year.
Beauty care products are placed because supermarkets are trying to fill a shelf space previously reserved for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's tells us that its range of beauty care products doubles with 3000 products, which for the first time contain brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space and will receive their own brand-specific areas like Boots stores.
The supermarket will also reboot its Boutique makeup range. In the future, the majority of products will be vegan friendly because young shoppers increasingly demand it.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop is experimenting with rental shops in two Sainsbury's stores. The first was opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second is opened at Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Internet purchases and the switch of food purchases to small single purchases in nearby stores force supermarkets to come up with new attractives for customers.
The CEO of Sainsbury's, Mike Coupe, has said that stores will look even more like department stores when the supermarket chain struggles with low-cost shops such as Ald and Lidl by increasing services and non-food products.
After buying both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores in its stores, as well as Habitat shops. The company reports that this has contributed to the sale of food products and made acquisitions profitable.
The supermarket failed in its previous attempt to renew its beauty care and pharmaceutical departments.
Sainsbury's tried the joint venture with Boots at the beginning of the 21st century, but the cooperation ended with the dispute as to how the yields of medicines in supermarkets should be distributed.
The new strategy follows a acquisition where Sainsbury's sold 281 its pharmaceuticals business to Celesio, owned by Lloyds Pharmacy, for £ 125 million three years ago.
The company reported that Lloyds was part of a plan to extend the range of luxurious skin care products to four shops with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
The commercial director of Sainsbury's, Paul Mills-Hicks, said: "We have changed the appearance and atmosphere of our beauty care departments to improve customer experience.
We have also invested in highly trained workers who are ready to advise customers.
Our range of brands responds to all needs and our attractive environment and our convenient locations make us a convincing beauty treatment shopping destination that challenges the traditional way to shop."
Peter Jones "in his rage" after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from the 11 million-pound contract
The Dragons Den star Peter Jones left in his "crowd" when TV guide Holly Willoughby withdrew from the 11 million-dollar agreement with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home supplies and costumes, Truly.
The two companies have been compared with the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of this Morning program announced his departure in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby pissed off Dragons Den with Peter Jones' withdrawal from their profitable lifestyle business in the last few moments, and now he's going to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources tell us that Jones was "happy" at the last Tuesday's tight-moved meeting at the Jones Business Empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinhamshire. The TV star girl had admitted that her new 1.5 million-pound contract would not leave enough time for their home-made and residential brand Truly.
The company has been compared with the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand, and it was bet that Willoughby would double the assets of GBP 11 million.
After the 37-year-old Willoughby announced that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
According to one source, "Truly was obviously Holly's most important project.
It was his long - term plan, which was to ensure his livelihood for the next two decades.
His decision of departure has left everyone astonished.
No one had to believe events on Tuesday so close to the publication.
Marlow's head office has a warehouse full of products waiting for sale."
This Morning leader is one of the most secure stars in Britain, and according to experts, his departure can cause the company to lose millions due to investment in products, which include everything from pillows to candles and clothing to household goods, not to mention a delay in the publication.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children willoughby and her spouse Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby arranged Cappin Truly in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones took over in March.
Couples together, Jones owns a 40% share of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is baked from the new brand ambassador of M&S, and he replaces Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity's ITV programme.
The source close to Jones said, "We don't comment on his business."
And then we fell in love.
He was joking about the criticism that he would receive in the media of his comments, which some would consider inappropriate for the President, and about his positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said he pretended to be a news anchor.
"I didn't give up at all."
He pointed out that Kim was interested in meeting again after Trump's first meeting as a significant step towards nuclear decommissioning in North Korea.
However, nuclear negotiations have been ruined.
Over three months after the Singapore Summit in July, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North will not see a "equivalent response" from the United States to North Korea's early disarmament efforts.
On the other hand, he said that the United States would continue with its sanctions for keeping the pressure on.
Trump had a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"Nighter North Korea is doing great," he said.
"We were running into a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have such an excellent relationship."
According to him, efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results. The missile tests have been stopped, hostages have been helped to freedom and the remains of American soldiers have been returned home.
He also defended his unusual style when talking about his relations with Kim.
"It is very easy to be Presidential, but instead of trying to get 10 000 more out into this filling hall, we would have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, showing the audience right in front of him.
The tsunami and quake of Indonesia destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
For example, in the wake of the Lombok earthquake, several foreign volunteer organisations were told that they were not needed.
The national emergency room required by international aid was not declared, although about 10 percent of the people in Lombok had remained homeless.
"In some cases, they have unfortunately made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so the situation is a little challenging," said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children form a group traveling to Palu, it is not certain whether a foreign staff can work in the field.
Sutopo, informant of the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities would assess the situation to see if international organisations would be allowed to participate in the assistance work.
Indonesia is still unfortunately unprepared to encounter natural forces, given the repeated earthquakes.
Although tsunami shields have been built in Acehi, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The prayer was likely to result in the loss of lives due to a missing tsunami warning siren, even though the warning was in force.
Traveling between the numerous islands of Indonesia is challenging even under the best conditions.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The hospital ship assigned to help the victims of the earthquake in Lombok is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before it reaches another disaster area.
President Widodo made Indonesia’s past infrastructure development at the centre of his election campaign, and he has provided money to improve roads and railways.
However, there has been a financial gap in the management of the team, while the new elections are approaching next year.
The tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where a majority of Muslims in the country have adopted a more ancient form of religion, are also under pressure.
Christians and Muslim gangs have fought with jungle knives, bows, arrows, and other primary weapons. This has led to the death of more than 1,000 people and tens of thousands have had to leave their homes.
See, Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge sunk a late settlement against Chelsea.
On Saturday Daniel Sturridge saved him from Liverpool’s defeat during the Valioli period after he painted at Stamford Bridge in London within 89 minutes.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqir 27 from Chelsea's goal when his team was in a position to lose the goal.
He moved the ball to the left before he terrorized the shot towards the back of the head.
The shot floated high above the penalty zone towards the right upper corner.
Eventually, the ball dropped over Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to make myself playable to get the ball and Shaq-like players to play as much upwards as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time as possible for myself," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approach, took one touch, and fired too much."
Chelsea led the match in half-time, 1-0, after the Belgian Eden Haard painting in 25 minutes.
The Blues Head gave Mateo Kovacic the pass-on before he rode away near the midfield and sprawled to Liverpool's fieldside.
Kovacic played fast-eating in the middle field.
And then he released Hazard's punishment zone with a great pass.
Hazard escaped the defense and passed Liverpool with Alison Becker's left leg shot in the back corner.
Liverpool will meet at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at the Masters League.
Chelsea will meet in the UEFA European League on Thursday, at 15 a.m., Videoton in London.
The death victims of the Indonesian tsunami are rising to 832 deaths.
Early on Sunday, the Indonesian disaster agency reported an increase in the number of earthquakes and tsunami deaths to 832 victims.
At the press conference, the agency’s informant Sutopo Purwo reported that many had been trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings when the 7.5-magnetized earthquake struck Friday and raised waves of up to six metres [6 m] high.
Fragmentations of broken buildings spread widely to the town of Please, 380,000 inhabitants.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after he found a woman stabbed to death.
A woman's body from Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning launched a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7.55 in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for the murder.
The police will ask the persons in the area to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its originals, but I appeal to all those in the vicinity of John Street to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also call on all cab drivers, especially those who may have recorded something on the dashboard video, to contact the police, who may have vital information for the investigation.
A female informant from the police has confirmed that the woman found dead is from Birkenhead, and that the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, there have been people who might know a woman who have asked where she was found.
As the investigation continues, the police report that they're trying to inform the victims of what happened.
The cab driver in Grayson Mews had just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police had told us that nobody was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents have just learned that they can go for hours before they are allowed back in.
One officer was told that the whole area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A tearing woman showed up at the scene.
He kept saying, "It's terrible."
There were two Maya in the area isolated from two afternoons and a third on the outside.
There were several police officers in the isolated area who controlled the apartment building.
Anyone who knows something is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, to call 101, or to call anonymously to Crimestoppers 0800 555 111 using the recognition 247 on 30 September.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament was part of the rewrite of history
It would therefore be a poetic right to evict a statue, bearing in mind that his own fanatical puritans destroyed English cultural and religious monuments as well as the best Taliban.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Mr Crick's proposal as a "tyry" and "rewrite history".
The president of the Crommel Society, John Goldsmith, said: "It was inevitable that the ongoing debate on the removal of statues would be a target for Oliver Cromwell's statue outside the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not command or execute the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
The wrong Cromwell might have to suffer from the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's wonderful description of Cromwell reflects the views of the 19th century and is historical evidence of a character that many still consider worthy of praise.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, though perhaps more than in the 1800s today, consider Cromwell as a defence of Parliament against external pressure, which, of course, was caused by the Monarchy in this case.
Is this a precise description of the subject, then, is it a subject of continuous historical debate?
At least it is certain that the debate in the mid-19th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell must be identified as a character representing the other half of that division.
In addition, his achievements as a government manager deserve to be thanked and remembered."
The killer smudged the Chinese farmer's life
Local media reports that the pig attacked the farmer and killed him in a market in Southwest China.
Only the body of a man known as "Yuan" was found near the pig market in Liupanshui in Guizhou. The man’s artery was broken and he was covered in blood, and the South China Morning Post newsed on Sunday.
The Shepherd is preparing to vaccinate pigs in the pig sector on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He and his cousin were reported traveling from Yunna County on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also noticed that the door of a nearby pig was open.
In Sikala, he said he saw a big pig whose mouth was in the blood.
According to the news, the forensic investigation confirmed the deaths of a 250-pound cattle farmer.
Guiyang Evening News says that a cousin named Wu said, "My cousin's feet were bloody and bruised."
The surveillance camera shows the cousin arriving at the market to feed the pigs on Thursday morning at 4.40 p.m.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the leaders of the market told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that it would not harm others when the police collected evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and the authorities are told to negotiate the death penalty.
The pigs are known to have attacked people before, even though it is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in the state of Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier, a pig of nearly 300 kilograms climbed against this tractor by a Welsh farmer until his wife managed to rush the animal out.
The Oregonian farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012. After the event, the farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that, although pigs are generally not aggressive, the taste of blood can act as a "gunner".
"They're just playful.
They're like little children, very curious, and they're not meant to hurt.
All we have to do is respect them properly," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains are bringing extensive rainfall to the American southwest
Hurricane Rosa is projected to deteriorate as he moves over the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days Rosa will bring floods to northern Mexico and to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa’s wind speed was 38 meters per second, i.e. Hurricane of the first class, on Sunday morning, at 5 p.m., on the east coast, and was 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, low pressure is emerging on the Pacific Sea, heading east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa arrives on the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to stab deep tropical moisture northward towards the southwest of the United States.
Rosa brings up to 250 millimeters of rain to some parts of Mexico on Monday.
After that, interacting tropical humidity will form large areas of rain for the southwest in the next few days.
At local level, rainfalls of 25 to 100 mm cause dangerous rainfalls and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes rainfalls of 50 to 75 millimeters per hour in certain landing areas, in particular in Nevada and Arizona.
For certain areas in the southwest, especially Arizona, up to 50-100 mm of rain is expected.
Heavy rains are possible and conditions can quickly deteriorate due to the fragmentation of tropical rain.
In the event of tropical rain, it is strongly recommended to avoid leaving the wilderness on foot.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into streams of water, and thunderstorms cause local windfalls and flying dust.
The approaching low pressure area brings local heavy rainfalls to the coasters of South California.
Rainfalls of more than 10 mm are possible, causing small waste streams and slippery roads.
It would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
Fragile tropical rainfalls begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday until the rains expand during Monday and Tuesday.
The rainfalls spread to Four Corners on Tuesday and last all Wednesday.
In October, the United States can see intense swings at temperatures as the Arctic region cools down, but the trophies remain relatively warm.
This sometimes causes large temperature fluctuations at short distances.
The central part of the United States has an excellent example of great temperature differences on Sunday.
Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha and Nebraska, St. Louis and Iowa Des Moines have a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees.
The slowing heat of the summer tries to become stronger and expand in the next few days.
The beginning of October is largely expected to be warm in the central and eastern parts of the United States, at a temperature of +26°C, from the south to the northeast.
In New York, the temperature can hurt on Tuesdays to +26 degrees, which is about 4 degrees higher than the average.
According to our long-term forecast, there is good potential for higher temperatures than the average in the eastern part of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million were consulted by Brett Kavanaugh
On Tuesday, over 20 million people watched six television channels, where the Supreme Court judge, Brett Kavanaugh, and Christine Blasey Ford, accused of sexual assault in the 1980s, gave their fascinating testimony.
At the same time, when the television companies were interrupting their broadcast, the political situation continued with the last-minute turn of the fact that the FBI is conducting a week-long investigation of accusations on the basis of a contract organised by Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs that he was 100% sure that he was drugged by Kavanaugh and tried to take his clothes off at high school.
Kavanaugh, on the other hand, gave an emotional witness statement saying that he was 100% certain that this did not happen.
There are likely to be more viewers than the 20.4 million reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company calculated the average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
The figures for other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which sent the opportunity were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often finds it difficult to measure viewers who watch in offices.
Something about proportions tells me that reading is in line with the number of players in the American football game or Oscar gala.
According to Nielsen, the largest number of viewers from all television companies was Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh’s name, with an average of 5,69 million viewers throughout the day during the consultation.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 89 million and CNN 2,52 million viewers.
After the hearing, interest was still high.
On Friday at the center of the drama was Flake.
The CNN and CBS cameras described how the protestors' screams led him on the way to the hearing of the Committee on Legal Affairs on Friday.
CNN showed us straight how he was standing at a one-minute shop looking down at the ringings.
"Seison right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you believe he will tell the people the truth?
"You have power when so many women are powerless," he was told."
Mr Flake said that he had given his opinion and added, before closing the elevator doors, that he had more to tell after consulting the committee.
Hours later, cable and universal transmission networks were sent directly when the Committee on Legal Affairs began to vote on Mr Kavanaugh's appointment to vote in the Senate's plenary session.
However, Flake said he only acted in the understanding that the FBI would investigate the accusations against the candidate in the coming week, as the Democrats in the minority have called for.
Flake became part of his friend, Democrat Chris Coons, based on the discussions he had with him.
He made his decision after talking to Mr Coons and several other senators.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of Brexit's politics
In an interview with Prime Minister Theresa May, the Sunday Times accuses people who criticise his EU-difference plans for politics, which threatens the future of Britain and its national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham in Britain on 29 September 2018.
Next to May's interview, another interview was published on the front page of the newspaper, in which his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on May's so-called Chequers plan.
Shooting Wayde Sims: The police arrested Dyteon Simpson as a suspect in the death of the LSU player
The police have arrested a person in LSU for shooting 20-year-old Wayde Sims who had played basketball.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and sent to prison, according to Baton Rouge Police Department, he's being charged with murder at second degree.
The authorities published a video of the investigation between Sims and Simpson, where the police say that Sims lost his glasses.
The police found the glasses at the scene and told them they found Simpson's DNA, says WAFB.
Police say Simpson admitted to shooting Way in interrogations.
According to Advocate, his guarantee was set at USD 350 000.
The coroner of East Baton Rouge's municipality published a preliminary report on Friday that the cause of the death was a gunshot wound in the neck.
The Agency thanks the Louisiana State Police Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and the residents of the region for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, the sports director of LSU, thanked the law enforcement authorities for their "extremism and justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
A two-foot attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball in LSU.
He wrote an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 balls in the match last season.
The LSU basketball coach Will Wade said on Friday morning that he was "horrified" and "suffered" about Wayy's death.
"You're always afraid of something like this," Wayde said.
A volcano spits ashes over Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl fire mountain has reached the southern settlements of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the Mexican Disaster Prevention Centre urged citizens to stay away from the volcano when crater operations accelerated and during the day 183 gas and ash discharges had been registered.
The center records the noise and vibrations several times.
In social media, images were published where in areas such as the Xochimillco of Mexico City, car windscreens were covered by a thin layer of ash.
Geophysics have observed an increase of 72 km from the capital to the southwest of the volcano since the 7.1 Magnified Earthquake shaking Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan Paratists will bring together before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in the conflict between the protestors and the riot police who supported independence. Thousands took part in competing demonstrations on the first anniversary of the divorce vote.
The police arrested a group of masked supporters of independence who threw eggs and powder paint at the police, which formed dark dust clouds on the streets normally filled by tourists.
Over the day, more harlots broke out when the police used their pumps to control the elves.
The match between the supporters of independence and the groups of Unionists continued for several hours, as the previous ones shouted "no forgetfulness, no forgiveness", and the latter "live Spain".
The local press reports that fourteen people have been treated for minor injuries in demonstrations.
Excitement remains on the surface in the area of independence one year after the October 1st referendum, declared illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by the Catalan Paratists.
The voters elected independence by a clear majority, although participation was low in the boycotting of the opposition.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured in the last year's violent conflicts when the police tried to prevent voting in polling stations across the region.
The groups in favour of independence stayed outside on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration was arranged, but it had to travel through another route.
Narcis Termes, 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist demonstration with his wife, said that there is no longer hope for the independence of Catalonia.
"In the last year, we experienced one of the best moments of our lives."
I saw my parents crying with joy to vote, but now we are stuck in place," he says.
Despite the close but vital victory that has been achieved in the regional elections last December, the speed of the parties supporting the independence of Catalonia has declined this year. Many of the most famous leaders are in a voluntary exile or arrested waiting for a trial for their participation in the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a police-friendly demonstration on his phone, says on both sides of the politicians there's an argument.
"Your account's getting tighter all the time," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the leaders of Catalonia in detention until the last nine years, announced that he would take part in the European Parliament elections next year.
"To become a Euro-election candidate is the best way to condemn the destruction and oppression of democratic values that we have seen by the Spanish Government," he says.
Londonderry: Men arrested after the car crashed into the house
From the age of 33, 34 and 39, men were arrested after being told that the car had repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The events took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 7:30 British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.
A few minutes later, they could have shot the car with a bow.
Livingston won Rangers 1-0 at Menga's goal
Dolly Menga's first goal in Livingston confirmed the victory
The serialist Livingston amazed Rangers and only caused Steven Gerrard another defeat in 18 matches as the manager of the Ibrox Society.
Finally, the Dolly Menga goal was to win as Gary Holt took second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's crew missed the first victory of the season in Premiership. Next thing you know, it'll be next Sunday's series leader Hearts, eight points ahead.
In the meantime, the Rangers will meet up at the Rapid Vienna European League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, continued his undefeated tube in the series for six games, and Chief Coach Holt hasn't lost even since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost places against a visitor suffering from a lack of steel.
The Holt team should have been led long before they scored, having caused the Rangers some serious difficulties with their direct conduct.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finishing went wide, and then Alan Lithgow was able to slide on the ground into Craig Halkett's bulldozer, but he was passing the ball.
The hosts were willing to give the ball control to the Rangers because they knew they could vaccinate special situations.
This is exactly how the important goal came to be.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free kick from which Declan Gallagher and Robinson played to Menga a place where he could move the ball to the center of the penalty zone and finalize it.
By then, the Rangers had held the ball, but said that the home team had a defense, and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not allowed to experiment.
The same pattern continued during the second half of the time, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to fight.
Rangers' goalkeeper Allan McGregor prevented Scott Pittman's company and Lithgow controlled the ball from another special situation in Livingston.
The focus on the Livingston Penal Area was constantly cleaned out, and two situations were called for unnecessary penalty kicks - a hacked exchanger from Halkett, Glenn Middleton, and a ball hit his hand.
"Excellent performance from Livingston - analysis
BBC in the Alasdair Lamont Tony Macaroni, Scotland
Great performance and result from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and was excellent for each player, continuing through the upsurges.
The team's way of playing and the crew have not changed much since it came back to the highest level.However, the Holt must be given recognition of the way in which he has strengthened the team once he has arrived.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great in leading an excellently organized defense, while Menga held the entire fight with Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
But the Rangers didn't have any ideas.
The team has occasionally played very well under Gerrard, but it is now far removed from his standards.
The last pass was exhausted, and they managed to open up the defense of the home team only once. This should be a wake-up to Rangers, who is in the middle of the series.
Erdogan was given a variable reception in Cologne.
The smile was delicate and the sky was blue on Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to improve relations between NATO allies.
There have been differences of opinion on human rights and freedom of the press as well as on Turkey's EU efforts.
Erdogan continued his journey to Cologne to open up a giant new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police prevented the 25 000-head support group from gathering in front of the mosque on grounds of safety, but there was still a great deal of supporters coming together to see the President.
Hundreds of the protestors against Erdogan - many of whom were the Kurds - also brought their voices to the audience, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to invite him to the country.
Competitive demonstrations reflect the division of opinion. Some of the German Turks greet him as a hero while others reproach him for being self-righteous.
Road accident in Deptford: A cyclist dies in a collision with a car
The biker died when he ran into a car in London.
The accident occurred at about ten o'clock in the morning at the Deptford Southwest Station near the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, where there is lively traffic.
The driver stopped and the medical staff came to the victim's aid, but the man died at the scene.
A few months earlier, another cyclist died in a traffic escape accident on Childers Street, about a mile and a half from the Saturday accident site.
The city police say they're trying to identify a man and inform his family.
There are roadblocks and bus traffic has been diverted and drivers have been called to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were injured in restlessness
Prison officials report the high-security classification of six prisoners in prison unrest.
Dispersion began and continues at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire about 9:30 p.m. on Sunday.
They've brought in special tornado police officers to calm down the unrest behind which there are eight prisoners in one prison wing.
The police had minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison service informant said: "HMP Long Lartin prison has been sent to a special trained prison staff to take care of the situation.
Six staff members have been treated for their injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be taken over by the police and may have to spend longer behind bars."
There are over 500 prisoners in HMP Long Lart, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the warden was reported to have received hospital care after one of the prisoners attacked him.
In addition, in October, riot police were alerted to serious unrest in which the personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa presents a threat to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (dry areas can benefit)
There are rare tropical pressures to Arizona, but that is exactly what will happen at the beginning of next week when Hurricane Rosa’s remains pass over the southwest desert, bringing with them the risk of heavy rainfalls.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning about heavy rainfalls from west Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, south-eastern Kazakhstan and Utah, as well as the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The rose is expected to proceed directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, which will arrive on Monday in the form of rain.
Phoenix's national weather service pointed out in its twitter that only "only ten tropical storms have maintained the state of tropical storm or low pressure at a distance of 300 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane still at a distance of 65 kilometers from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre predict rains of 50-100 millimetres. Mogollin ridge in Arizona can rain up to 150 millimetres in some places.
In other southwest regions, including the central cliffs and Great Basin, it is likely that 25-50 millilitres can be obtained. In some places it can rain up to 100 millimeters.
The rains of Rosa can also be a blessing in the dry area if there is no danger of heavy rainfall.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some rains can be useful because of severe drought in the southwest.
According to the U.S. drought agency, more than 40% of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest class, says weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will first take his route to land on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
Sunday morning, the location of Rosa is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, which is still a hurricane with a wind speed of 135 kilometers per hour, moving north at 20 kilometers per hour.
The storm loses its power when it comes to colder waters in the Pacific.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico as a tropical storm strong during Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts of Mexico, rains can be heavy and cause a significant risk of flooding.
"From the California Peninsula to the north-west of Sofia, 75 to 150 mm is expected, and up to 250 mm is possible," says Weather.com.
Rosa will then continue her journey through Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border as a tropical low pressure on Tuesday mornings, from where it will continue its journey through Arizona to southern Utah by Tuesday late.
"The greatest risks associated with the Rosa or its remains are very heavy rainfalls in the California Peninsula, in the north-west of Sonora and in the southwest of the United States," says the National Hurricane Agency.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening rainfalls and waste streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found wounded in Excelsior Terrace, Midsomer Norton, Saturday at 4 p.m. in Britain.
He was taken to a hospital where he was told to be in a "stable" state.
Police say they arrested one 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old man in the Radstock area in Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking for contact with anyone who may have video footage of events recorded on a mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh has experienced the democratic party's evil and anger.
"My voice on behalf of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the unscrupulous and shameful methods of the democratic party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered from the democratic party's "terroristy and anger" throughout his terming process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, he strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of sexual harassment, which would have happened decades ago during their teens.
Ford also witnessed his accusation in the hearing.
On Saturday, the president said that "Americans saw Kavanaugh's excellentness, character and courage" on that day.
"My voice for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh's appointment is the voice of one of the most well-deserved legal students of our time with excellent mermaids for public service," he told his support team in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of the Republican voting activity in the interim elections.
"We are five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
I'm not just campaigning, I was campaigning full," he said.
"That's why I'm going all over the world to fight for the excellent candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats took on the task of 'responsibility and prevention'.
The senior assistant to the Republican leadership informed CNN that the first important vote on the appointment procedure for Kavanaugh is expected to take place at the Senate no later than Friday.
Hundreds of dead in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunamis, the number of deaths expected to rise
On Saturday the authorities reported at least 384 deaths following a major earthquake and tsunami attack on the island of Sulawes in Indonesia. Many were wiped out along with the giant waves that hit the beaches.
At the festival on the beach of the city, please, hundreds of people had gathered on Friday, when waves of up to six metres high hit the beach in the evening.
Tsunamin caused a 7.5-magnetized powerful earthquakes.
When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, when they became victims of it," says Purwo Nugroho, informant of BNPB's major accidents in Jakarta, Indonesia.
"Tunami came not alone, but he drew with him cars, wooden hulls, houses and struck all over the country," Nugroho says. He adds that the tsunami reached a speed of 800 kilometers per hour in the open sea before it hit the coast.
Some of the people survived the tsunami by climbing into the trees, he says.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The air images published by the disaster agency show a number of destroyed houses and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The after - earthquakes continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes felt like an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Evaluation and Application Agency BPPT issued a statement that the energy released in the huge earthquake on Friday corresponded to some 200 atomic bombs dropped in Hiroshima in World War II.
It says that the landscape of a city long and narrow away from the bay could have boiled the tsunami.
Nugroho described the destruction as a "wide" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
He said that some of the bodies of the victims were found in the ruins of the collapsed buildings and added that 540 persons had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the victims of death and that the damage could be greater than the cost of the Request 300 kilometres north of the continuous coast, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the center of the quake.
Communications are "extremely broken, and there is no information on Donggala", says Nugroho.
According to the statement made by the Red Cross, over 300 000 people live there, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," he said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not telling us that the tsunami hit Palu, although the authorities said that the waves arrived during the warning.
In a social media shared amateur video, the man on the top floor of the building screams fiercely at warnings to the people on the streets of the approaching tsunami.
Only minutes later, a water wall will hit the beach that takes buildings and cars along.
Reuters couldn't verify the authenticity of the image material.
Earthquake and tsunami caused a widespread power cut that cut the communications, please around. This made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate their rescue measures.
The authorities tell us that the army has begun sending help from Jakarta and other cities on transport vehicles, but the evacuated ones still urgently need food and other basic supplies.
The city airport has been reopened for assistance only and will remain closed until October.
President Widodon was scheduled to visit the evacuation centers on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
It's really bad.
The staff of the World Vision Donggala have been safe, please, to the city where they have been housed in tent roofs in the inner yard of the office.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he says.
It's really bad.
When relief teams began their unsatisfied task, some complained that foreign aid workers would be prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to the Indonesian provisions, foreign funding, equipment and personnel can only start to flow once the disaster area has been declared a national disaster zone.
This has not happened yet.
"There is still a disaster at the level of the province," says Aulia Arrian, informant of the Indonesian Red Cross.
'As soon as the government says that 'OK, this is a national disaster', we can start receiving international assistance, but the declaration has not yet been made'.
When the second night landed on the floor after the Friday earthquake and the tsunami, friends and family members who were missing felt the hope that their close to the miracle trade would depart from the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been in ruins for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the Indonesian addict team coach, had trained two missing hangers for the Asian competitions that ended earlier this month.
Roa Roa Hotel also caught up with his students, says Mandagi.
"As an older member of the pendulum, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Gendon says he was desperate to reach out to those who participated in the beach festival. Please compete with the WhatsApp messages after the news of Roa Roa's collapse spread among the addict community.
However, after the messages he sent, only one grey sign appeared instead of two blue ones.
"I understand that means no messages were sent," he says.
Thieves took $26,750 on a ATM supplement to Newport on the Levee
Thieves took $26 750 from Brink's security staff on Friday morning, when this was completing the ATM in Newport on the Leve, which is reported in the Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the car had been clearing out and completing the ATM at the entertainment center, Detective Dennis McCarthy explains in the newsletter.

People with information on their identity are asked to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapist Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
When he announced a change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "The man who used to be known as Kanye West."
Ye has been the nickname of the 41-year-old West for some time, and he also used it as the name of his eighth album published in June.
The change is preceded by his upcoming performance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to publish his new album called Yandi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the author of the program, cancelled his participation for 'monetary reasons'.
In the past, the word has also a religious significance for him, not only as a shortcoming of his trade name.
While discussing the album's name earlier this year with radio jockey Big Boy, West said, "He believes that "yes" is the most common word in the Bible, and there its meaning is "you".
"So I'm you, us, and all of us.
It began with Kanye, which means only, and ended up in a short form Ye, which merely reflects the goodness, evil, confusion, everything in us.
The album is mainly a reflection on who we are."
He's one of several known rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs is known for varying names as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he liked the names Love and Brother Love.
Also, the former JAY-Z partner in West has sometimes removed and returned the link and the big letters.
Mexico AMLO promises not to use the army against civilians.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected President of Mexico, promised never to use military force against civilians, and the announcement came on the 50th anniversary of the actions of revenge against students as the country approached.
The Lopez Obrador, who appeared at the Tlatelolco Plaza Square on Saturday, promised that "no army would be used to suppress the Mexican people".
Armed forces fired a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young people in Mexico by offering monthly study support and opening up more free public universities.
He said that young people were driven into crime gangs by unemployment and lack of access to training.
The United States should double funding for artificial intelligence research.
The U.S. should double the funding it has used to study artificial intelligence when China is making it more efficient in the sector, as the funding provider and artificial intelligence professional Kai-Fu Lee, working with Google, Microsoft and Apple, says.
The opinion was preceded by communications on artificial intelligence in various parts of the US administration, although the US lacks a formal artificial intelligence strategy.
In the meantime, China has already presented its plan last year: it will seek to lead the development of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, considering that other countries are so behind the United States, and that we are looking for another breakthrough in artificial intelligence," says Lee.
The duplication of funding could double the likelihood that the next significant artificial intelligence achievement would be performed in the United States, Lee reported this week's CNBC interview.
Lee's book "The Grand Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month through Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. He works as CEO in Sinovation Venture, which has invested in one of China's most important artificial intelligence companies called Face++.
In the 1980s, he developed an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University, which defeated the highest-ranking Othello player in the United States. Later, he was the director of Microsoft Research and director of Google’s Chinese operations.
Lee acknowledged the previous technology competitions of the US administration, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be organised to identify future visionaries.
Lee says that U.S. scientists worked hard to get public aid.
"Academic influences are not taken by China, but by the big companies," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that the changes in immigration policy could help the United States to step up its artificial intelligence efforts.
"I think those who have completed an A.I.D. degree should be automatically granted green cards," he said.
The Government of China’s next generation of AI development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Science Foundation grants funding to people working in academic institutions in the same way as the National Science Foundation and other government organisations grant money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is weaker in China, Lee said.
The U.S. Department of Defence established earlier this year the Joint Artistic Intelligence Center of the Defense Department, which is designed to bring together industrial and academic world partners, and the White House has also announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
DARPA was also announced this month for a USD 2 billion investment in AI Next.
In turn, the NSF invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, the legislative initiative to set up a national safety Commission for artificial intelligence has not advanced for months.
The Macedonians in a referendum to change the name of the country
In the referendum on Sunday, the Macedonians voted to change the name of the country to 'North Macedonia'. The change of name would solve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has prevented the country's efforts to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, a province of Macedonia, considers that the name of the northern neighbour is, in practice, a territorial requirement for its territory and has therefore opposed its entry into the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the countries signed an agreement on a new proposal for names, but the nationalist opponents felt that change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in a referendum, and the campaign against the vote raises doubts as to whether the voting activity will reach the required 50 % threshold so that the result is legal.
The question in the ballot box was: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership, accepting the agreement with Greece".
Supporters for a change of name, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price should be paid so that Macedonia, which has risen from the collapse of Yugoslavia, can seek to become a member of both the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of our country, on behalf of the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live in freedom as members of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said the 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of this House have said that they respect the outcome of the vote in order to have a decisive effect.
Change of name requires a majority of two-thirds of Parliament.
According to the Central Electoral Commission, no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, voting activity was only 16 compared to 34 per cent of the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the voters finally voted.
"I came to vote on behalf of my children and our position in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old, who voted for the capital in Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica and his son, Dushko, voted in a referendum on the name-change of Macedonia in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018 , would open the way for NATO and the EU membership .
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of tents set up by boycotts in front of the Skopje Parliament.
"We carry NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads up, not through the kitchen door, said Kavaldarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to the other side, such as China and Russia as part of the integration of the euro area."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring the required investment in Macedonia, with a unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I believe that a large majority will vote in favour of the change in name because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev, after he gave his vote.
He said "yes" is our "damaging future".
The opinion poll published by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research on Monday referred to the 30-43% voting activity in the referendum - the under-required activity.
In the second survey conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70% said they were voting for the yes option.
In order to succeed in the referendum, voting activity must exceed 50% by one vote.
The failure of a referendum would be the first serious setback for the Western-minded government to take over in May last year.
See Manchester City Sergio Aguero beat the entire Brighton defense with his paint.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a clear impression of Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
At 65 minutes, Aguero made it look ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the figure, the Argentinan top player was fed from the midfield.
He found an empty space in the field, rushing through three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero noticed to be surrounded by four green shirts.
He stabbed one defender and then left several others on the edge of the Brighton penalty zone.
After that, he found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English tip used its first touch within the penalty zone to give the ball back to Aguero, who passed the Brighton guard's Mathew Ryan goal with a shot at the right corner.
City manager Pep Guardiola told journalists that "Aguero has problems with his legs".
"We talked about him playing for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored in that time."
However, Sterling had already given the celestial blue an advantage in the polyolean struggle.
The painting came in 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He gave Leroy Sane a beautiful pass on the left.
Sane took a few contacts before he sent the ball to the back of the head towards Sterling.
The celestial assailant stabbed the ball into the net just before the end of the line.
City will meet in the block phase of the Hoffenheim League on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Mr. Scherzer wants to be a fun joker in a fight against the Rockies.
The Nationals are out of the playoffs, so why try hard to get a start-up?
However, Scherzer always hopes to take over the pitch in the Sunday's match against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still has a play-off seam. They have one win in the western Los Angeles Dodgers series.
Rockies picked up at least a wild card with a 5-2 win over Nationals on Friday night, but still aiming for their first division victory.
"Although we do not have a stake, we can at least rise to the pitch, knowing that the atmosphere of the audience and another team here in Denver creates the most demanding competitive position I have faced this year.
Why don't I want to take the challenge?"
The Nationals have not yet published their starter on Sunday, but according to the information, they tend to give Scherzer an opportunity under these circumstances.
On Thursday, Scherzer had a training session, and he'd play the 34th at the start of his game, and he'd be on his normal rest shift on Sunday.
The right hand player in Washington has a 18-7 win/lose ratio this season. ERA statistics are 2.53 and he's burned the batter's nest 300 times, while the pair statistics are 220 2/3.
Trump campaigned in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation of Brett Kavanaugh as his candidate for the Supreme Court, who also spoke about the importance of the Republican voting activity in the interim elections.
"All our achievements will be in the game in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
This is one of the great ones -- not just campaigning, but campaigning full, and that's why I'm going around everywhere to fight for the excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democracies, you see it happening right now.
They've decided to return to the cove by any means necessary.
They will not choose whom they harm, or whom they shall cast, so that they may gain power: that they will have power and power, but we will not give it to them.”
He said that the Democrats took up the task of 'responsibility and prevention'.
"And it has been seen in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "hot and evil and evil and lying."
When he referred to the longest democratically active Democrat in the Senate's Committee on Legal Affairs as Dianne Feinstein, the public responded with a loud boost.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Ah, uh, what.
Well, no, I'm looking forward to it-- it was really bad body language-- the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a tolerant congregation.
It does not tolerate those who say their opinions
I was not really surprised when my local party, Momentum activists, supported the motion of censure against me.
At least I'm just the last representative of the last line of Labour to be told that I'm not welcome - just because we're making our views known.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way only because he was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censure was a criticism that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On matters relating to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, although ironically similar, which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour meeting said on Friday that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
The majority of the eight years that I have served as a local representative of Labour have been precisely that of the party council on Friday.
Now many meetings do not follow that tone, and the "friendly and gentler" policy has long since been forgotten if it ever started.
It is even more clear that the Labour Party will no longer tolerate differing opinions and that every opinion will be assessed on the basis of whether or not it is suitable for the leadership of the Party.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and the colleagues with whom I thought I had shared a similar political view began to expect from me a complete version and comments I would never have agreed otherwise, whether national security or the EU internal market.
Every time I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - the consequences of insults in social media, which calls for the withdrawal of my choice, the rejection of a central policy, and I hear that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my own experience.
I really know that I am more fortunate than some of my fellow Members, because the comments on me are of a political nature at least.
I greatly respect the professionalism and determination of my fellow Members who face daily sexual and racist insults and who never fail.
The normalisation of abuse is one of the most disturbing aspects of this era's policy.
Last week Jeremy Corby insisted that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party for differing opinions, and with every censure statement or change in the selection rule the party becomes more limited.
For two years, I've been told to keep a low profile and refrain from expressing my thoughts so that "all goes well".
But that's not why I went to politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago as a result of failure by the government of Thatcher to attend a single school, I, as city councillor and Minister, have tried to promote better public services for those most in need of them.
I've never covered my political lines, not even my last election.
No one in the Nottingham East has been surprised by my views or my differences with the current leadership.
For those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that, when the state is moving towards a brexite that affects households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy to question my confidence in the leadership of the Labour Party.
But my real message is not to the Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters: I represent you with honor, and the threat of separation or the promotion of political career will not prevent me from acting in a way I think is in your best interest.
Mr Chris Leslie, Member of the Nottingham East constituency
Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Undefeated Ayr in a block head
Two last-minute goals slightly distorted the outcome of the match, but Ayr undoubtedly earned a victory in the entertaining Tennent's Premiership game of the day.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team of ten who have not lost a single match.
After all, a great defence and more successful risk-taking was what supported them, and coach Peter Murchie can be satisfied for a reason.
"We've been challenged in our fights, and we're still undefeated, so I can be satisfied." he says.
Melrosen Robyn Christie says, "All honors to Ayri, they took risks better than we did."
At 14 minutes, Ayr took the lead with Grant Anderson's goal and Frazier Climon's successful conversion kick, but the yellow card of the Scottish captain Roy Hughes who gave to the Warriors' match allowed Melrose to rise, and Jason Baggot scored the goal.
Climo raised Ayri's leadership in the penalty paint, and just before the half-time he scored and succeeded in the conversion kick, increasing Ayri's leadership to 17-5.
But Melrose started the second round very well with Patrick Anderson's goal, which, at the conversion kick, Baggot managed to narrow the gap to five points.
There was a long delay in the game when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and carried out off the field. As the game continued, Ayr raised his head with Stafford McDowall’s goal, which was successful in the conversion-beating Climo.
Captain Ayri Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, after which Melrosen Bruce Colvine scored a hard-pressed goal that the conversion hit failed.
However, the home team replied when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card from the ballless Climo fighting, and Macpherson scored the finish from the sideline throwing of Ayri's maul.
Climo succeeded in the conversion kick in the same way as before, and Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's kick and dragged Gregor Henry to finish the fifth goal of the home team.
Still Game star starts the restaurant industry
The star of the Still Game series, Ford Kieran, has been designated as the head of a licensed restaurant company and will start working in the restaurant sector as well.
The 56-year-old actor, Jack Jarvis, makes his recommendation on the BBC program he's scripting with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The twin has announced that the coming ninth period is the last of the series, and it seems that Kierna is planning her life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he has been designated as head of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor himself refused to comment, but the source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kierna wanted to participate in the booming restaurant business of Glasgow.
"The sea belongs to us": the inland state Bolivia is trying to get back in touch with the Pacific Ocean by legal means
The sailors are patrolling outside the fleet base in La Paz.
The flag poles of public buildings contain a blue sea flag.
The ship's base points for Titicacalta Amazon have been stunned with a slogan: "Justifiably, the sea belongs to us.
It's our duty to get it back."
In the inland Bolivia, the memory of Chile’s landline lost in the war on resources in the 19th century remains strong – as does the desire to sail in the Pacific Ocean once more.
The hope is highest for decades when Bolivia is waiting for the International Court of Justice ruling on 1 October after five years of reflection.
"Bolivia has strong progress, common spirit and internality, and, of course, a positive attitude in waiting for the final solution," said the Venezuelan diplomat Roberto Calzad.
Many Venezuelans from all over the country will follow with hope the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens, hoping that the Hague will be sidelined – after decades of intermission – by Bolivia’s view that Chile has an obligation to grant Bolivia independent access to the sea.
The charismatic President of Bolivia, Evo Morales, who will face the re-election of the controversial battle next year, will be in a great deal on the line next Monday.
"The return to the Pacific Ocean is very close," he assured at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the Court is unlikely to decide in the interest of Bolivia, and even if it were decided, the situation would not change much.
The Dutch-based UN institution does not have the power to give up Chile's administrative areas, and the ICJ has also announced that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ's decision is given only six months after the last comments suggests that the case is not complex, says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Moreover, for the last four years, they have been slowing down rather than promoting Bolivia’s intentions.
"The current Bolivian regime has captured the issue of maritime connections," Zárate said.
The rhetoric challenging the Morales dispute has suppressed the rest of the Chilean charity, he said.
Bolivia and Chile are still having discussions at some point, but it is very difficult to organise negotiations after this.
There has been no second embassy in either country since 1962.
The former President and the Bolivian representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, do not accept the view that the Court's decision would have been exceptionally rapid.
Monday gives Bolivia a "exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "stop 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit", she said.
Calzad also denies that Morales, one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, would have used the maritime issue as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to connect with the Pacific Ocean," she added.
"The decision is an opportunity to understand that it is time for us to move forward from the past."
North Korea stated that there would be no nuclear decommissioning unless it could rely on the United States of America.
North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington, said North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He reminded the United States of keeping the promises made by the Heads of State at the Singapore Summit.
It was just before the US Foreign Minister, Mike Pompeo, was re-launching a deadlock diplomacy with nuclear weapons, only three months after the US met Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said that it is a long-distance dream to believe that the continued sanctions and the US opposition to the end of the Korean War brought North Korea to its knees.
Before Pjongjang has first taken significant measures to promote disarmament, Washington is alert to the adoption of the declaration.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump of the United States want a new summit.
However, the view that Pyongyang is going to give up the weapons arsenal, which the state is likely to see as the only real means of ensuring its own security, has been broad suspicion.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the next Kim-Trump Summit.
Paris’s fashion shows present the most recent collection’s large-scale headgear, which will soon be in your nearby street
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you do not need to continue looking.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed in their SS19 presentation a range of special oversized headphones that dazzled the style circles of Paris fashion week.
Very impractical capitals took over Instagram this summer, and these designers have also sent their amazing creations to fashion shows.
Valentino’s most striking creation was the beige hat with wide feathers, which covered almost all the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jewelry - decorated watermelon, wizard hats, and even pineapples — but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of extraordinary masks – just before Halloween.
Several colorful masks had sewn lips, and they resembled Hannibal Lecter more than top fashion.
One creation with snorkel and mask was more like a diver, and the other reminded of the melted ice cream.
And if you want to take a stand for a big fashion, you're lucky.
The followers of the fashion predict that the huge scarfs are appearing in the street.
Excessive-sized hats follow strictly "La Bomba", a shoulder hat with a gallon of six feet [30 m], which has been seen from all Rihan to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult of the impractical hat in social media also encircled another large creation into the fashion shows – a straw - made bag that is nearly as large as the model that carries it.
The burnt orange stripboard with white leather handbands was the most striking creation of Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 model in Paris's fashion week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I see large hats and beach bags on the street next summer – designers have made such an impression that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large accessories."
John Edward: language skills is a key skill for a world citizen
The learning results of private schools in Scotland have traditionally been good, and this success has continued in 2018 as a result of good test results. The success has been reinforced by individual and social success in sports, art, music and other community projects.
These schools are located across Scotland, with over 30,000 pupils represented by SCIS, the Scottish Council of Private Schools, seeking to provide a high level of service to their pupils and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for their chosen careers, higher education, higher education and world citizenship.
As an educational operator who can design and implement customized learning content, we have noticed the status of languages as a popular and desirable subject in continuing educational institutions.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to a person in his own language, the message goes into his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on the English language if we want to build a relationship with the people of other countries.
The latest test results of this year show that the languages are at the top of the lists for the percentage of pass-through between private schools.
68 percent of students who studied foreign languages reached their highest grade A.
The material was collected from 74 schools belonging to the SCIS. Based on the data, it was found that students who received the best grade A, 72 per cent studied Mandarin Chinese, 72 per cent studied German, 69 per cent studied French and 63 per cent studied Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support the study of foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
The languages are currently free-choiced, but they are considered to be of equal value to natural sciences (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the private school curriculum and elsewhere.
On the basis of the survey carried out by the UK Employment Office in 2014, it became clear that 17 per cent of the situations in which the employer had difficulty finding a suitable worker for the job were explained by inadequate language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore even more necessary to promote the career development of young people.
The more possible tasks require language skills, the more essential these skills will be in the global world.
If a person has studied another language, he will have an advantage in the future of this lifelong skill, regardless of the career he has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner will automatically put a person with language skills above the competition.
According to a survey carried out by YouGov in 2013, 75 % of the over 4,000 IsoEU adults are unable to have a conversation in a foreign language, and France was the only language with a two-digit figure of 15 %.
That is why it is important for the children of today to be involved in language teaching.
In particular, knowledge of the languages of developing countries gives children a better chance of finding a meaningful career.
Within Scotland, schools differ in what languages they teach.
Several schools focus on traditional languages, while some teach specifically languages that are supposed to be important for the Iso Britanians in 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese and Japanese.
Despite the interests of your child, private schools always have several language options taught by specialised teachers.
In Scotland, private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future will bring upon arrival.
It cannot be denied in this time that languages in the international business environment will continue to be very important for the country's future, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be seen as "International communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and a high level of young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.

LeBron's making a debut on Sunday in San Diego.
The expectations of the supporters waiting for LeBron James to begin in Los Angeles Lakers' ranks are almost over.
The Laker Coach Luke Walton has announced that James will be playing against Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego before the beginning of the season.
But for how many minutes he really plays, we'll be able to see.
"It will be more than one, and less than 48" said Walton Lakers on the official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, leaked that James would probably play for a few minutes.
James, who followed the exercises, was asked earlier this week about his plans for the Lakers ahead of six games to play.
"I don't need any more pre-games to prepare for this stage of my career," he said.
Trump Western Virginia campaign time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will start a series of election campaigns today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be Trump's first five election events scheduled for next week, including sympathetic targets such as Tennesse and Mississippi.
As the vote awaits his election to fill the seat of the Supreme Court judge, Trump seeks to increase support for the forthcoming interim elections, as Republicans are in danger of losing a majority in the Congress at the November elections.
At what time is the Trump Western Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
The event of Trump’s Western Virginia Wheeling will begin at 19 o’clock on Saturday, 29.9.2018.
You can view Trump's Western Virginia campaign event online as a live scores via YouTube by clicking below.
Trump would like to take the position of the Supreme Court of this week's referee to the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh, who became ardently accused of sexual harassment, which has delayed the Senate's confirmation vote, as much as a week in the FBI's investigation.
But the priority objective for the series of campaigns is to support the success of the Republican candidates in the strict November elections.
Thus, President Trump's campaign was commented on for the five events of the following week, "to raise the Republicans to protect and extend the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The rule of the Congress is so essential to his purpose that the President is prepared to travel to as many states as possible during the urgent campaign period," Reuters was told by Trump's anonymous representative.
Today's venue is at Wesbanco Arena Wheeling, and there are even supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump’s second visit in the last month in West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump supports Senator Patrick Morrisey of the Republican West Virginia, who has been left behind in the polls.
"It is not a good sign from the point of view of Morrisey that the President is trying to increase his support for opinion polls," said state scientist Simon Haeder, from the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team shows a will to fight to keep hope ahead of Sunday’s singles
After three one-sided sessions, the four-games on Saturday afternoon were exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
Although the self-enhancing power of success is a fully invented phenomenon in sport, players still believe in it, and more and more in tournaments such as this.
Where do they think this power of success is now?
"They had a six-point lead, which narrowed to four, so let's take this as a kick in the success force," said Jordan Spieth, walking away at the end of the day.
Europe has, of course, an advantage: four points ahead and 12 can be played.
The Americans, as Spieth said, feel that they have a little wind in the sails and a lot of encouragement, such as Spieth and Justin Thomas, which enabled them to play together all day and score three out of four.
Spieth has been overwhelming from road to green, leading by example.
The hoarse sounds of the victory feast strengthened as he went forward when he succeeded in a critical tube to even out the match at exactly four, when he and Thomas were two points behind after two holes.
The set that they won after the 15th match was followed by a similar cry, which gave the impression that he believed that the United States team had not yet lost.
"You need to concentrate really well and take care of your own game," Spieth said.
It's the only thing these players have left.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who have received more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Ryder Cup's undisputed legends of Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
The special but sweet twin of Europe has won four out of four without error.
"Moliwood" was the only twin who didn't make any bogs on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That round, and the way they give and get energy from this gruesome audience, confirms that they are Sunday's pre-advanced ones. And when the sun sets at Le Golf National, another more popular player to ensure Europe's possible victory could not be like Fleetwood and Molinari.
I'd rather have both at the same time in different holes.
However, the talks on the success of Europe are premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, who was the hero of the four-game game in the morning, with Alex Noren.
One bog and two double bogs in the first nine holes dug the Spanish and Swedish into a hole so deep that they were not near to survive there.
But on Sunday, no one will come to help you get out of the hole.
Four-ball and four-game are fascinating to follow closely from the point of view of cooperation between couples: what kind of advice they give or fail to give, and how the strategy can change in the short term.
Europe has played better as a team until now and taken a major lead before the last day, but this four-game showed that the United States team has a will to fight, even though it has been suspected in particular in the United States.
Europe takes 10-6 lead before Ryder Cup's last day
Europe is in good leadership before the last day of Ryder Cup, after they took the 10-6 lead in Saturday's four-balls and four-games from the United States.
The great twin Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the victory with two profits from the rapping Tiger Woods, and got the score up to four points today at Le Golf National.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, who made a great effort to maintain the victory he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the poorly played United States team in four-balls in the morning, leading to a match situation of 3-1.
The United States was a tougher opponent in four games, winning two matches, but they were unable to narrow the lead position.
Jim Fury's half needed eight points from Sunday 12 to keep the win.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner who has won four points in a row. He and Molinari, also called "Molliwood", were sensational after a weekend in the history of Ryder Cup, another twin that has won four points in the first four games.
After first breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they then finished 5-4 Bryson Dechambeau, the over-lossed Woods and U.S. beginner.
Woods, who barely survived the two-games on Saturday, was occasionally very great, but still has lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-ball and four-games, and even seven consecutively.
Justin Rose rested the morning with four balls, but returned with Henrik Stenson to four games, but lost 2-1 for Dust Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are the first and third in the rankings.
Europe did not get everything as it wanted on this fresh and pleasant day from Paris to lunch.
Three times as many as Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high target for the United States on Saturday.
They're going to get a big 2-1 win from Jon Rahlroy and Ian Poulter in four balls in Spain, and then a 4-3 win from Poulter and Rory McIllroy in four games after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup the team has risen from four points to the level at which the two games started, even though Furyk's side is enough to maintain the win.
However, after being two days to the second best, it may be that the attack on Sunday is too much to ask for.
North Korea "not in any way" takes itself out of arms without trust
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister told the UN that continued sanctions only increased confidence in the United States, and under these circumstances there is no chance that North Korea would unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
At the UN General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said that in the last year, North Korea has taken "significant measures of good will", such as completed nuclear and missile experiments, demolished a nuclear test site and promised that North Korea would not increase the amount of nuclear weapons or technology.
"However, we have not seen such a gesture from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be certain that national security will be maintained, so, under such circumstances, it is not possible that we strip ourselves of arms unilaterally."
Although Mr Ri repeated the familiar complaint that Washington did not accept the phased abandonment of nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded for every aspect, his statement is important in the sense that the disengagement of one-sided weapons was not completely excluded, as Pjongyang has done in the past.
Mr Ri referred to the joint opinion adopted by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit of the President-in-Office of the United States of America and the Director of North Korea in Singapore on 12 June.
North Korea has formally sought to end the Korean war from 1950 to 1953, but the United States has demanded that Pyongyang first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the facilitation of the strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States calls for "nuclear removals first", and they have increased pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal of forced force – even resisting "the declaration of peace", Ri said.
"The thought of sanctions getting us on our knees is the desire of the indifferent.
But the problem is that constant sanctions only deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention the plans to hold the next Kim-Trump Summit, which Trump himself emphasised to the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings with the South Korean leader, Moon Jae-in, during the last five months, and added: "If a party requiring the removal of arms had been South Korea and not the United States, the situation would not have progressed to such a dead end."
However, the tone of Rin's voice was significantly different last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the direction of missiles towards the United States was inevitable after the "bad President" Trump called Kimi a "missile man".
Last year Trump threatened "to destroy completely" North Korea. However, this year Trump strongly praised Kimi for her courage to approach the ceasefire, but nevertheless stressed that there is still much work to be done and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea surrenders nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday Trump mentioned that he does not have a time limit: "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argued that the UN Security Council should reward the progress made by Pyongyang.
However, on Thursday the United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council that "the strengthening of the Security Council's sanctions should continue strong and without fail until we can prove the complete, final and reinforced abandonment of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with the aim of stifling the financial channels for the production of ballistic and nuclear missiles in Pyongyang.
Mr Pompeo met with the North Korean Ri in connection with the UN General Assembly, and he also announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month for preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the latest visit did not go smoothly.
When he left Pyongyang, he described the progress that had been made. However, North Korea condemned Pompeo's "gangsterlike requirements" only a few hours later.
North Korea committed itself to closing the missile base and nuclear facility at a meeting with Secretary-General Moon earlier this month in the event that the United States is taking "equivalent measures".
According to Pompeo, Kim means "equivalent measures" to the security guarantees Trump committed to at the meeting in Singapore and moving towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students complete a training course for sufficient rest
All basic students at Harvard University take part in this year’s course to increase students’ rest. The course is a response to the macho culture that flourishes at the university, where students weigh long nights with caffeine.
According to the researcher, students at the best university in the world are often quite ignorant of their own well-being in the fundamentals.
The course was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler of Harvard University Medical School, who works in a sleep study at Brigham and Women's Hospital, believes that the course is the first of his kind in the United States.
Czeisler received an idea for a course after he was lectured on the impact of a sleep shortage on learning.
"After the lecture, a young woman came to me and said, "Why am I only hearing about it now, as my last year of study?"
No one had ever told him about the need for a dream, which I thought was surprising," he said at the Telegraph interview.
For the first time this year's course will guide students on how true unity supports academic and sporting performances and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of medical sciences at Harvard University, and vice president of health services at the University, says that the university has completed the course after they have heard how students suffer from severe sleep shortages during the study week.
The hour course includes a set of interactive tasks.
In one section, students are presented a picture of the dorm room where the student can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books, and thus get information about the effects of caffeine and light and the impact of sleep shortages on sports performance and the importance of regular evening activities.
Part Two tells participants how long - term sleep shortages can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to consider their daily routines.
"We know that this has no immediate impact on student behavior.
However, we believe that they have the right to know about these matters in exactly the same way as they have the right to know about the health effects of smoking", Professor Czeisler adds.
According to Professor Czeisler, all night-long studies are still a subject of pride, and modern technology and the increasing pressure of students made sleep deficits a growing problem.
"To get enough and high quality sleep should be the students' 'secret weapon' against stress, fatigue and anxiety, and even against weight gain, because the lack of sleep causes a state that resembles hunger in the brain, which is why people are constantly hungry", the professor points out.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in chemical and physical psychology, helped Professor Czeisler plan his course after he had attended one of the courses he taught during his first year at Harvard last year.
He tells us that the course opened his eyes and gave a boost to all campus students to organise a comprehensive course.
He hopes that all post-graduate students could carry out a similar set of studies before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students should also be reminded of the time of bedtime not only by morning waking but also by asking them to keep in mind the side effects of electronic display devices and LED lighting on the daily rhythms, which can make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's shot took the win from Gerrard's players
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers once again experienced a new loss-making day when Dolly Menga's shot through the disintegrated defense brought Livingston a 1-0 victory.
Ibrox's players were about to win their first match since February 4-1, which was against St. Johnstone. Gary Holt's team, however, took the win this time, and Gerrard now had his second defeat during his 18-game manager's career. The Rangers were eight points away from the current leader of Valioliiga Hearts.
The Menga set the ball to the finish seven minutes before the halftime, and then the Rangers lost their fighting will and no longer evened the situation.
The Rangers fell to sixth place as a result of the game. Livingston has instead climbed to third place, and the goal difference is higher than the Hibernia.
The Rangers may have other problems, as during the game Calum Spence was injured by an object thrown out of a foreign view, and the wound has been treated.
Gerrard made eight shifts to the formation by which the team had struck Ayri and advanced to the semifinals of the Scottish League.
Holt continued with the Livi 11 assembly where the team took a point from Hearts last week. The same strategy again produced results when a well-structured assembly managed to discipline the opponent almost every turn.
Although the Rangers managed to dominate the possession of the ball, Livingston was better off using the situations for his own benefit.
Livingston had an opportunity to get a goal in two minutes, when the first pass of Menga gave Scott Pittman a freeway to Allan McGregor's goal. However, Pittman failed to take advantage of the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed his free kick to Craig Halkett, but another defenseman, Alan Lithgow, managed only to shoot in the back.
The Rangers took control of the game on the one hand, but the last third of the game no longer had confidence in the air.
Alfredo Morelos demanded punishment when, in fifteen minutes, he and Steven Lawless had run into each other, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored Colombian requests.
The Rangers managed to try only two goals in the first half. However, the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly rejected the barely slow shot of Lassana Coulibaly and Ovie Ejaria.
Livingston's goal for 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but it wasn't just the team's hard work.
The Rangers still couldn't do anything about Jacobs' long-range pitching tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fed Scott Robinson, who cold-headedly gave the ball to Menga for an easy goal.
By changing Gerrard decided to change Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent in the field. The change almost immediately affected the game when Kent created a suitable opening for Morelos. However, Kelly was interrupted by the attack.
Livingston made visitors play their own game again, while Lithgow and Halkett continued long feeds after each other.
The Holt team had the opportunity to raise their heads in the last moments of the game, but McGregor's fine defense prevented Jacobs' intentions before Lithgow could get to his position in the corner.
Glenn Middleton, who became the Rangers' exchange, also claimed a punishment for taking Jacobs together, but again Thomson looked away.
Apples: Geigermeter Inventor
Next page of our Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882. Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, the future physicist, was born in Germany today 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. The invention later led to the development of a device known as geigerometer.
The method became one of the pillars of science and also a central concept of pop culture. For example, the 1950 film "Coronado Watches", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans present scientists who are quite influenced by cattlemen:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers said, "It's a geigerometer, it's used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put headphones in your ears, you can actually hear the effect of radioactive radiation on minerals."
Evans: "Look, now it's really a ride!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that carries his name still lives.
A new cancer vaccine is capable of teaching the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells
The new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system ‘see’ malignant cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of treatment
The method is to isolate resistant cells from the patient and amend them in the laboratory.
After treatment, the cells injected back into the body are able to ‘see’ the typical proteins for several cancers
Dog tissue has been shown to produce promising results in patients with various cancers.
For example, cancer cells in patients with ovarian cancer disappeared within 18 months after being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells.
The method isolates resistant cells from the patient and is modified in the laboratory in such a way that they are able to ‘see’ the typical HER2 proteins for many cancers.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Bethesda, describes the method: "based on our findings, this is a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "directs the growth of several types of cancer", explains Professor Berzofsky. "These include breast cancer and cancer of the ovaries, lungs and colons."
A similar approach – taking resistant cells from the patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells – has also produced results in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West was put into critics' teeth after celebrating Trumpia's campaign hat at Saturday Night Live.
Show didn't go as planned.
Kanye West received a round of bouncy in the Saturday Night Live programme after a blatantly lauded President Donald Trump and announced that he would seek to be president in the 2020 elections.
After presenting his third song "Ghost Town" to Trump's Make America Great Again campaign, the West attacked the Democrats and reiterated its support for President Trump.
"When I'm talking to a white person, they ask me how I can support Trump because he's racist.
If racism were a problem, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he says.
This evening's broadcast began with a sketch where Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh's hearing in the Senate Committee on Justice, which relates to the statements made by Christine Blasey Ford about sexual harassment by Kavanaugh.
We don't see West's bludgeon on live television, but comedy Chris Rock downloaded a break from it into the social media.
It's unclear whether Rock is trying to make fun of West with his post office.
In addition, the West complained to the public that it had been treated badly by a hat that it held in its backseats.
"I was bullied behind the scenes.
I was told I shouldn't go on stage with this hat in my head.
I've been bullied!
Then they'll say I'm in the field," says West at the Washington Examer interview.
West goes on to say, "Do you want to see what the margin means?" and says that he's wearing the Superman sign because "you can't tell me what I'm doing, you want the world to move on?
Try it with love."
According to Variety, the comments made by West were arouses the audience at least twice, and the performers of the show looked embarrassed. One of the people present described the situation to the newspaper as follows: "The whole studio went completely silent."
The West was selected for the program at a short notice to replace Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
In many viewers, the West caused confusion by performing the song "I love it" dressed as a Perrier bottle.
The West is supported by Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative TPUSA organisation, who praised his courage on Twitter: "WELCOME FOR A WHITE ROSE".
However, Mrs Hunter said that the West "is only herself, which is absolutely wonderful".
"I can, however, decide to be a person (by buying this music or a brand of clothing or by supporting this "art"), which I consider to support and disseminate harmful ideology for my community.
He's a free man.
The same applies to us," he added.
Before he performed on Twitter, the rapper announced that he changed his name to a person known earlier as Kanye West.
West is not the first artist to change his name. The musician follows Diddy here, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The second rapper, Snoop Dog, was also known as Snoop Lion, and we also remember, of course, the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and later an artist known as Prince.
The Belfast restaurant snuffer is charged with attempted murder.
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after being stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
According to the police, the incident took place in the Ballyhackamore area.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belgian court on Monday.
The prosecution shall be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, an actor of the throne game, is attacking toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is known for his sword-spining hero role as Jon Snow in the violent fantasy series of HBO.
However, Harrington has attacked the machosankar stereotype: according to a 31-year-old actor, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned with hardness.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Harrington suspects that something has gone wrong in the case and questions the means available to intervene in toxic masculinity during the period of #MeToo phenomenon.
Harrington, recently married to Rose Leslie, who is also part of the Star Guard of the National Court game, admits that she has a strong desire to intervene.
"The question where we have gone wrong with masculine makes me feel strong at the moment," he says.
"What has been taught to men in the years of their growth, which has led to the problems that we are seeing?"
Harrington believes that television and its very masculine characters are partly responsible for increasing toxic masculineity.
He goes on to say, "What is inborn and what is learned?
What is learned on TV and on the streets that make young boys feel that they must be certain in order to be men?
I think this is one of the great questions of our time – how can we change this?
Young men have something really wrong."
In the course of the interview, he also admits that he would not participate in the production of the pre- or downstream parts of the Valtsun game after the end of the series next summer because, according to his own words, he was "sufficient with combat fields and horses".
In November Harrington will be seen in the new version of Sam Shepard's play True West, which tells about the film producer and his kidnapper brother.
The actor recently revealed that getting to know his future Rose wife was the best thing the Volatile Game has offered her.
"I met my wife in this show, so in a way it gave me my future family and my life since then," she says.
Rose Leslie played Ygritte, the target of Jon Snow's love for Harrington's performance in Emmy's award-winning fantasy series.
The couple was married in June 2018 on Leslie's family premises in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: New infections have increased by 14% in China
China has reported an increase of 14% in the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-infected citizens.
According to the health authorities, the virus affects more than 820 000 people in the country.
Some 40,000 new cases have been reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
A clear majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which means a change in previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through contaminated blood transfusions.
However, according to the Chinese health authorities at the conference in Yunnan, the HIV infections in this way have been reduced to almost zero.
A year later, however, the number of HIV-infected and AIDS-infected patients in China has increased by 100 000.
HIV infection via sex is an acute issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBTs has been reported to be common.
Studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women due to the conservative values of the country.
Many of the diseases are caused by insufficient protection in such relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised to ensure the universal availability of HIV medicines as part of its efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the information of the employee's leaked Republican censor and accuses him of spreading "hazardous lies" and "secretary theories"
On Saturday, Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, challenged claims that his staff had published personal information on the Wikipedia pages concerning them.
The democratic representative from Los Angeles assured that the 'extreme right' commentators and websites are the distributors of the claims.
"The lies, lies and more detestable lies," says Waters in his opinion on Twitter.
Among the information published is reported to have been the home addresses and telephone numbers of Senator Lindsey Graham, representing South Carolina and Senator Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, representing the state of Utah.
An unknown person released information from the U.S. Congress on Thursday during the hearing of the Senate Committee, which involved allegations of sexual abuse against a candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Punds and RedState, report that according to Hillin newspaper, messages were published from an IP address attached to Waters’ office and by a person belonging to Waters’ staff.
"This unwarranted accusation is completely false and it is an absolute lie," Water continued.
"My employer, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised by these false and false accusations, has no form of responsibility for the leaking of this information.
This unjust accusation is completely false and absolutely false."
Waters' statement quickly received criticism on the Internet, and critics were also accompanied by the former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"The way he denies this is very hostile," wrote Fleischer.
"It seems that his character is not suitable for a member of Congress.
When accused of something he has not done, he has no reason to behave hostilely.
There's no reason to be obsessive.
There's no reason to question the prosecutor's motives.
The situation should be moderate and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during the hearing on Thursday.
The Republican candidate, Omar Navarro, who is competing for Waters' seat in Congress mid-terms, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
"Unbelievable if this is true," he said.
In its opinion, Waters stated that he had contacted "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement bodies for these false accusations.
"We make sure the authors are exposed," he continued, "and that they will be legally held liable for all the destructive and dangerous actions of some or all of my staff."
Johnny English strikes again – the underpower Rowan Atkinson agent parrot
There is already a established tradition of searching for brexit references from any film that is expensive towards Britain. However, this does not seem to fit the Johnny English agent parody and the operating comedy series, which started in 2003 at Johnny English, and reinvigorated in the 2011 extension section "Johnny English – Reborn".
Can a nation’s satir of the cheek become a new national export success in Britain?
Yes or no, it is Johnny English who has earned his license for the second time. Even his name tells us above all that it is a comical creation aimed at a film market outside the English-speaking world.
It is, of course, the stupid secret agent who is desperately trying to breathe glamour around him, but appears as a mix of Inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean, and the unfortunate one-note musician at the London 2012 opening concert.
The foundation of the figure is the cosmopolitan and mystical world man who was originally presented by Atkinson in the already forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials.
I mean, the last show has its moments.
I especially liked the scene where Johnny English arrives in a helicopter dressed in a medieval forks, and his helmets are collapsing.
Atkinson’s physical comedy presents gifts, but humor itself seems under-efficient and unusually unnecessary, especially because ‘severe’ film brands, such as 007 and the dangerous task, today provide humor as part of the main content of the film.
The humor seems to be directed at children, and I don't think Johnny's crazy treatment seems as inventive and sharp-looking as the comedy of Mr. Bean's mute roles.
The starting point of the year is that Britain is in a bad situation.
The cyber hacker has infiltrated the British top secret spy network and exposes the identity of all British agents in the field as a knockout by a working agent, which is presented as a unfortunate small role by Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop to the important and latent Prime Minister, who is already in the middle of his ears in political disapproval: Emma Thompson is doing everything she can in the skins of the Teresa May parodia figure, but the manuscript just doesn't offer him enough space.
When counsellors of the intelligence service inform him that all spies on the field have been exposed, there is an urgent need to call someone who has already left active service.
Of course, it is a sneezing Johnny English in his own person. He spends his retirement days as a fine school teacher, but at the same time gives informal lessons in the nobles of espionage.
English is grateful to the emergency meeting in Whitehall, where he will meet again his endlessly patient battle partner Bough, who will continue to be played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine commander whose role Vicki Pepperdine does not seem to have access to his rights.
Thus, the disastrous Batman and Robin have returned to his Majesty's secret service to face the fateful super-criminal Ophelia Bhuletova of Olga Kurylenko's act.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is about to be manipulated by a charismatic IT billionaire.
English and Bough's odysse will turn into a farce: a twin masked as waiters will set a fine French restaurant on fire and cause chaos in the covert pursuit of Volta's luxury yachts. The company will get acquainted with Volta's house with virtual glasses will end its pure anarchy in the real world.
Despite all the powerlessness and charm, the film still seems to have been made to the children’s audience.
The film can be considered moderate.
While watching Johnny English, I have already come to the same reasoning: why is the British film industry unable to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would justify his talent?
The British Labour Party denies plans for four-day working week with five-day pay
The Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is considering a radical plan for British workers to work four days a week, but the salary would be paid for five days.
The party is reported to be demanding the transfer of the savings generated by the artificial intelligence revolution to the workers in the form of an extra day off.
According to the plan, employees could enjoy three-day weekends at the same wage.
It follows that the idea of ‘satisfied’ with the party's economic programme and its plans for a more costly policy for the benefit of the workers.
The Central Trade Union Organisation supports the transition to a four-day working week as a means of enabling workers to benefit from a changing economic situation.
The source of the High Level Labour Party tells Sunday Times: "The review of the line was announced before the year exchange.
The change will not take place in the short term, but a four-day working week is an objective that fits the party's approach to balance the economy for workers and the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party is not the first to support the idea: the British Green Party committed itself to supporting the transition to a four-day working week in the context of its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, this objective is not to receive indivisible support in the lines of Labour.
A Labour Party informant states: "The four-day working week is not the party's orientation, and the party does not consider such a transition."
Last week, Mr McDonnell, Minister of Finance of the shadow government, took advantage of the work conference to present his vision of the economic revolution.
McDonnell said that he was determined to regain power from "encouraging dictators" and "distributors" of companies of general interest.
Under the plans of the Minister of Finance of the shadow government, the current shareholders of water companies would not be able to regain their share in their entirety, since the government led by Labour could carry out "reductions" on the basis of the abuses found.
He also confirmed the plans to place employees in company management and to create inclusive equity funds to transfer 10% of the private sector company's share capital to employee management, with the plan being to pay up to 500 pounds per year to the individual worker.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are discussing the 60 minutes program as to whether an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh will change their minds.
The investigation of charges against FBI Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed at least a week's final vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh as Judge of the Supreme Court, and the delay also raises the question of whether the outcome of the investigation could undermine the support of some Republican authorities to Kavanaugh's appointment.
In the 60 minutes programme to be sent on Sunday, Scott Pelley, the programme correspondent, asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it was possible for the FBI to find out what they could change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Then, of course," Kennedy said.
"I told you when I was hearing... "I've been talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened when the accusations came up and asked him ‘Did you do it?’
He was determined, determined, unambiguous."
And Graham's voice, on the other hand, looks like a stone has been hacked.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and it's a bomb-proof one," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following thing: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added Christine Blasey referring to Ford.
"Never of the people he named could confirm it.
It's about 36 years old.
I can't see what could change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival, held in New York on Saturday, is a music event whose performer card is as impressive as its mission: the elimination of poverty from the world.
Now the Global Citizen Festival is attracting tens of thousands of people to New York Central Park lawns to listen to performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make known the real goal of the event: the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a follow-up to the Global Powery Project, an international advisory group aimed at poverty eradication by increasing the number of people active in poverty eradication.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (if not willing to pay for the VIP ticket), the public will have to perform various tasks or "acts", such as voluntary work, send an e-mail to the political decision-makers or make a call, or perform any other act that disseminates awareness of the objectives of the project.
But how has Global Citizen succeeded, now that there is no more than 12 years to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding a free concertist a real way to persuade people to take action, or is it just one ‘clicit’ among others – the idea that the world can be changed by signing a web address or sending a TV?
Global Citizen announces that it has published more than 19 million "acts" on behalf of different objectives since 2011.
According to this, these actions have encouraged political decision-makers to report commitments and principles that account for over 37 billion dollars and that have been used in a way that affects more than 2.25 billion people's lives by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group listed 390 commitments and declarations on the basis of which more than $10 billion have already been used or collected.
The Group estimates that the funds achieved have already had an impact on the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The main commitments include, for example, The Power of Nutrition, a group of investors and executives in Great Britain, which is committed to "help children develop to their full potential". The group committed to providing Rwanda with $35 million to end their malnutrition in the country. This was after the activists had sent them 4 700 TVs as a result of the Global Citizen campaign.
"With the help of the British Government, donors, governments of different countries, and world citizens like you, we can transfer social injustice and malnutrition to the journals of history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, to the public at a concert held in London in 2018.
According to the Group, the British Government was also called upon to take action to improve the nutritional performance of mothers and children by more than 5,000 actions, and the Government has published funding for the Nutrition project, which focuses on 5 million mothers and children.
One of the questions asked on the website of the movement is: "Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
Global citizen's response: "Tie becomes long and hard and many stumbling stones are ahead of us.
However, we will succeed, such as the major civil rights battles and the movements against apartheid before us, because together we are stronger."
Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are conducting a New York concert this year, and its star map includes artists like Janet Jackson, the Weekly, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe.
According to the U.S. Department of Home Affairs, the country can make energy exports more difficult by using the fleet as a "prevention"
According to the US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke quoted by Washington Anaminer, Washington may, if necessary, rely on its fleet to help prevent the spread of Russian energy on the world market, including in the near future.
Zinke claims that Russia's action in Syria, at the invitation of the legal government, is an excuse for the reticence of new energy markets in the region.
"I believe that the reason for [Russia]'s presence in the Middle East is energy transmission, just as in Eastern Europe, the southern half of Europe," Zinken is said to have said.
According to the administrator, ways and means are available to prevent this.
"The United States has the ability to keep the voyages open with the help of its fleet and, if necessary, by means of an island to ensure that the energy they offer does not end up on the world market" he says.
Zinke spoke to the public about the event organised by the Energy Consumers' Association, a non-profit group that profiled as a "noise of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued by comparing Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran by pointing out that it was one thing and the same thing.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less speculation, and replacing fuel with another," he says, and describes Russia as a "one-step circus number", whose economy is based on fossil fuels.
The statements are due to the situation in which the Trump regime has sought to step up the export of LNG to Europe and replace the much cheaper Russian LNG.
In order to enhance this, Trump's administration, including President Trump, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unfit" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to President Trump, binds Berlin to Moscow's hibernation line.
Moscow has repeatedly focused on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the transmission capacity of 110 billion cubic metres of the pipe in use, as a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that there are purely economic reasons behind Washington’s opposition and considers it to be an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of pressure, and that consumers must have the option to choose its supplier," says Alexander Novak, Russian Minister for Energy after meeting with the US Minister of Energy in Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US attitude has led to a counter-reaction in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The country's leading industrial roofing organisation, the German industrial association, has called on the United States to keep separate from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I find it very problematic that the third state is involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Director of the Federal Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin recently.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts, intends to give careful consideration to the candidate for the Presidential elections in 2020.
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts, announced that he would "consider carefully" the presidential candidate after the mid-terms.
Warren confirmed that he was considering the nomination at an open interview in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It is time for women to move to Washington and correct our flawed government, and this also means a woman at the head of the kingdom," he said according to The Hill.
"After the sixth day of November, I intend to think carefully about becoming a candidate for President."
Warren assessed President Donald Trump during the opportunity to say that "he is taking the country the wrong way".
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he says.
Warren has played a direct role in criticising Trump and the candidate for this Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, according to the opinion poll published on Thursday, the majority of Warren's voters do not support this proposal in 2020.
According to a study carried out by the University of Suffolk's Institute for Political Research and Boston Globe, 58% of the 'likely' voters in Massachusetts are not in favour of a candidate.
32% were in favour of a candidate.
A number of those who answered the question supported the candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick with 38% while 48% opposed the idea.
Other prominent democratic candidates for the 2020 elections were former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press News Office, Biden has said that he will formally decide on his nomination by January.
Sarah Palin refers to her son's military trauma at Donald Trump's election.
Sarah Palin's son, Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after becoming armed forces in September.
Track Palin was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son has to go through when I return home, I can well identify with other families who have to face the consequences and injuries of PTSD that our returning soldiers are carrying," he told the public at the elections in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Donald Trump.
Palin called the arrest “the hippo in the living room” and said his son, as did other war veterans, “returning at home a little changed, they return hard, they will return wondering whether he and his associates in the army and in the air force have done for this country.”
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska. According to Wasilla's police officer Dan Bennett, he was charged with domestic violence and abuse against a woman, and family violence and the handling of the weapon.
18 states and the Columbia Alliance support the new asylum policy action
Eighteen states and the Columbia Alliance are seeking a change to the new approach that has entered into force in the United States, according to which asylum is not granted to people fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
The 18 states and allies have left a letter of justice on Friday in Washington, Washington. The letter supports asylum seekers who break the line says NBC News.
The full title of the lawyer has not been published in the so-called Grace vs Sessions, which was raised by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal order.
He says that his partner "and his sons of violent gangs" abused him. United States authorities refused him asylum on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
The public prosecutor who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, most of which are from the United States of America's asylum seekers, as countries where gang and family violence are a common problem at all levels of society.
The new US asylum policy repealed the decision taken by the Board of Appeal on asylum applications in 2014, which allowed paperless immigrants to apply for asylum on the basis of domestic violence.
Karl Racine, General Prosecutor of the Columbia Federation, commented on Friday's opinion that the new trend "is ignoring the federal, federal and international law for decades".
"The Act of the Act of the Supplementary State requires all asylum applications to be resolved on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and this kind of obstacle to this principle is stated in the letter of friends of the right of asylum.
In their letter, the prosecutors also claim that the practice of preventing asylum seekers from entering is damaging the US economy, as arrivals are likely to become entrepreneurs and "import the necessary additional labour".
In June, General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges to suspend the granting of asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"The place of refuge is intended for persons who flee their home country because of persecution or fear caused by race, religion, nationality or a particular class of society", Sessions announced in its opinion on the new asylum practice of 11 June.
The asylum was never meant to solve all the problems — even serious — that people face every day around the world.
Desperate survivors' rescues continue in prayer – the number of deaths found has already doubled.
The situation is becoming more serious for the survivors.
"Your farm is very tight," says 35-year-old Mother Risa Kusuma, while calming down her hot baby, please at the desolate evacuation center in the city.
"Ambulances bring new bodies from one minute to another.
Clean water is scarce."
The inhabitants are returning to their destroyed homes, picking up their watered goods, and trying to save what is still to be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured and 7.5 magnetized quadruple-damaged hospitals are full.
Some injured people, such as Dwi Haris, who suffers from vertebral fractures and shoulder fractures, rest outside the military hospital, where patients are being treated for persistent, severe sequelae.
His eyes are filled with tears when he repeats how violent an earthquake rocked the fifth - floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I'm stuck in pressure between the ruins of the wall, I think." According to Associated Press, Harris tells me that he and his family were in town as wedding guests.
"I heard my wife screaming for help and then it got quiet.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accused China of "provoking" with "propaganda declarations"
The American Ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the American newspaper as a means of propaganda, a week after the Chinese newspaper had published a four-page advertisement in the US daily newspaper, praising the mutual interests of the US-China trade agreement.
Last Wednesday U.S. President Donald Trump referred to China Daily's paid annex to the Des Moines Register newspaper, which is the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of being involved in the 6th November congressional elections.
Trump’s accusations of Beijing’s attempts to get involved in the US elections mean, according to the U.S. authorities who spoke to Reuters, a new stage in Washington’s expanding campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for a foreign government to spread notifications to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an ever-restricted trade war, in which both parties, on their turn, impose duties on the export products of the counterparty.
According to Chinese and American experts, Chinese revenge tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were aimed at states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump.
Terry Branstad, American Ambassador to China and the long-term governor of the state of Iowa, says that Beijing has done damage to the working population, farmers and businesses in the United States, and Iowa is a major exporter of agricultural products to China.
China "is now accelerating its provocations by publishing propaganda announcements in our free press", wrote Branstad in his opinion paper published in the Des Moines Register of Sunday.
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese Government benefits from the US's prestigious free word and press tradition by placing a paid announcement in the Des Moines Register", Branstad writes.
"In the journals on the streets of Peking, differing opinions are seen only in a limited way, and real, different opinions that Chinese citizens may not see at all from the alarming developments in their economies. This is because the media is strictly in the line of the Communist Party in China," he writes.
Branstad continues by saying that "one of the largest newspapers in China has been able to publish an offer", an article he wrote, but does not specify which magazine is about.
Kavanaugh Fiasko banishes female voters from Republicans, analysts warn
According to analysts, the fact that many of the Republicans' censures stand behind and defend the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh may result in counter-reaction, particularly in the forthcoming mid-terms of female voters.
The feelings surrounding the case have been going on large rounds, and most Republicans have already announced that they want to proceed with the vote.
"These things cannot be reversed," says Professor Grant Reeher of State Studies at the University of Siracus Maxwell in an article published on Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher doesn't believe Senator Jeff Flake (Republicans, Arizona) last minute's offer of an FBI investigation to comfort angry voters.
"Women do not forget what happened yesterday and they will not forget tomorrow or November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and informant of the National Reform Group on Friday according to the newspaper published in the capital.
On Friday morning, the protestors sang "November is coming" in their opinion in the Senate's ruling of the ruling Republicans of the Court of Justice to proceed on Kavanaugh's appointment, which happened despite Dr. Christine Blasey's testimony, Mic reports.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be predictable," says Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst in an interview with the news site.
"The people say that the enthusiasm has already been high, and that is true.
But it could be even greater, especially among the insecure female voters of the neighbourhood and the younger voters, who are between 18 and 29 years old, who often do not vote because they do not like the President."
Analysts anticipate a possible counter-reaction if the Republicans advance with confirmation even before the Ford testament against the Supreme Court candidate, in which he made his claim about sexual harassment.
"This is going to be a mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee to NBC News at the beginning of last week.
"This is not just a question of the vote of the Committee or of a final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put to the hearing; it is about how the Republicans have acted and how they have dealt with Fordia", Guy Cecil, Head of the Group of the People's Democratics' Group of the United States, pointed out to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided in whether they should believe Ford or Kavanaugh’s testimony as a result of a narrow majority’s tendency to the latter.
According to the new opinion poll by YouGov, 41% of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford’s testimony, while 35% say they believe in Kavanaugh, or probably in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% say that Kavanaugh is likely or definitely lying in his testimony, while only 30% say the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's push forward, the FBI is investigating Ford and at least one other charges against Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian's report.
In front of the Committee on Legal Affairs, Ford sworely testified Kavanaugh to harass him when he was 17 years old when he was drunk.
Ramirez claims to have revealed to him his genitals at the student party while they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet as a counterattack for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup company designed to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the Solid platform of the Berners-Lee open source code.
Solid allows users to decide where to store their data and who has access to any information.
In an interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, Inrupt's purpose is to "rule the world".
"It has to be done now," he said, referring to his start-up attempt.
"This is an historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal data store", i.e. POD.
It can include contact lists, notebooks, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser at the same time.
The unique thing about personal data storage is that it is completely closed to the user who has access to what type of data.
The company calls it "the personalisation of data".
According to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is to give resources, processes and the necessary skills to bring Solid to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Leen, Bruce, a safety platform purchased by IBM, some hired developers working with the project and a community of voluntary coders.
Technology developers from all over the world can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on Inrupt’s website. This will all be available from this week onwards.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team will not discuss with "Facebook and Google whether people should be offered a perfect change in which all their business models will be turned on in one night".
"We will not ask their consent."
In an article published in medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote inrupt "the task of providing commercial energy and ecosystem for the unity and quality of a new network built for Solid".
In 1994 Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet at the World Wide Web consortium Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the last few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee maintains its position as founder and leader of the World Wide Web consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute, even after Inrupt.
"I am extremely optimistic in view of the next age of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The city remembers the hero priest of World War I
The city celebrates the only priest awarded by the Victoria Cross medal of the Church of England who has been a soldier for 100 years.
The sports medal was awarded to Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann on September 29, 1918, as a result of the attacks on the villages of Belleglise and Leaucourt.
Vann died, however, four days later the sniper was created without ever knowing of the highest honor of the British army.
Two of his grandchildren were revealing a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire last Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says that the event is a 'symbolical'; the monument was revealed for almost 100 years after the performance of his rewarded grandfather.
According to London Gazette, 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Vann led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quent "in a very dense fog and under heavy field cannons and machine guns."
Later, he rushed to the front line and led the troops to advance before he rushed alone to the field guns. In the battle that followed, Vann poured three artillery soldiers with his own hands.
Colonel Vann died with a German sniper created on 4 October 1918 — only a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's act was "someone like whom I could never achieve, something that raised respect."
Michael Vann He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, had a smith after the parade of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band orchestra.
Michael Vann says it is "a great honor to have a part in the parade" and added, "the great crowd is remembering the glory of a true hero."
Friends of the free match waited all night for the Bellator 206 tournament – TV channel Pipsa Possu
Imagine a situation in which you have been up all night to watch an expected Bellator 206 tournament, and the whole event will not be presented.
The San Jose event program had 13 matches, six of which were the main series matches, and the show was to be live on Channel 5 in Britain.
At six o'clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the ring program to switch to Pipsa Pigsus viewers for a great stun.
Some viewers were not really happy to watch because of the fight all night.
A friend of the free game opened on Twitter describing the replacement of the game by children's drawing "some kind of sick joke".
According to the law, this content was not suitable for presentation at six o'clock in the morning, so they had to change it to a children's program," explained Dave Schwartz, the senior marketing and communication assistant director of Bellatori, who was responsible for marketing and communication.
Piss Pig, yes.
Scott Coker, director of Bellator, said that the timetables will be worked out so that British viewers can monitor events in the future.
"I'm thinking about the new transmission we're probably gonna make the show work," Coker said.
"However, six o'clock in the morning is there, and we must not present the programme before Sunday for our time, which in turn is Monday at their time.
We're working on it.
You can believe that when the program changed into their heads, messages began to move in the direction and in the other direction, and they were not all friendly.
We tried to correct the error because we thought it was a technical problem.
However, this was not the case; it was a legislative matter.
I can promise you this will not happen next time.
We're gonna limit the number of matches to five instead of six, as usual, and we're gonna try to offer our fans more money and try too hard.
This is a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
The swimmer and Olympic athlete Tom Daley said he felt inferior to all others because of his sexuality, but this motivates him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete tells me that he only found out when he came to high school that "all aren't like me".
Lauren Laverne, who was planning a radio 4 channel in the Desert Island Discs program, says that he talked about gay rights to give others a wish.
He also tells us how winning the Olympics after having a child was no longer so important.
Kristy Young, the regular host of the long-term radio program, has taken several months off due to a disease.
As a guest in Laverne's first program, Dale said that he felt ‘lower’ than everyone else when he was young, because ‘it was not socially acceptable to keep boys and work’.
He says, "To this day, these feelings, feeling smaller and different, have been reality, and they have given me the strength and energy I have needed to succeed."
He says that he wanted to show himself to be ‘something’ so that he would not disappoint everyone until his sexuality was finally revealed.
Two-time Olympic Bronzemitarians have become a high-profile LGBT activist and are performing this year's national community competitions in order to criminalise homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came out because he felt lucky to live openly without consequences, and wanted to give ‘hope’ to other people.
The three-time world champion tells of his love for a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – "as a surprise".
Daley got married to this 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but says that the age difference has never been a problem.
"If you experience so many things so young" – he attended his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later – "it is difficult to find another of the same age who would have experienced similar problems and suffering," says Daley.
The couple had a son in June – Robert Ray Black-Daley – as a result of which Daley's "total perspective" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, my life would have been around winning the gold medal," he says.
"You know, there are bigger things than the golden Olympic medal.
Robbie is my Olympic Kultamal."
His son was named after Daley's father, who died in 2011 only 40 years of age of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father never accepted that he would die, and one of the last things he asked Daley about the 2012 Olympic tickets, he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wasn't gonna be there anymore to be in the front row," Daley says.
"I held her hand when her breath stopped. Only after she had really stopped breathing and she was dead, I finally realized that she wasn't invulnerable," she says.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the Bronze.
"I knew this was something I had dreamed of all my life – jump in front of the home audience at the Olympics. There is no better feeling," Daley says.
This was also an inspiration for his first choice of songs – the Heather Model song "Proud" – which raised emotions while he was preparing for the Olympic Games, and which still gets his skin on chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 a.m.
Half-carrying Mickelson for a bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson is breaking the record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup tour, but he has to cheat very hard to avoid the fact that a record tour is left in history as an unfortunate performance.
Mickelson, who plays the record 12th time at a two-year event, went to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the time of the football and the foursome on Saturday.
In general, the American five-time Major tournament winner now spent half a day as a cheerleader and on the other side of the field trying to take over.
48-year-old Mickelson, who was not even thought to be one of the most accurate drivers in his career, is not an ideal choice for a tight Le Golf National, where a long-growing bout punishes the impertinent.
If there is not enough resistance to Mickelson himself in the field, then the ninth game on Sunday is against the accuracy of the well-known British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who, together with the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood, is playing with the goal of having all four winning pipes this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind when they come to 12 double games, get a flying start, the Michelson game can prove extremely important.
Furyk has expressed his confidence in the player, but what else could be said about the situation.
"He fully understands the role in which he played today. He killed me in the back, beat me up and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence.
He is one of the best players and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
That's all I imagined, but this is how it went, and that's the kind of solution we came up with.
He wants to be on that field as much as anyone else."
Mickelson's breaking Nick Faldo's record of several games of Ryder Cup on Sunday.
It may also mean the end of a man’s Ryder Cup career, although it was never comparable to his personal performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half points, but Fury says his presence brings something undefined to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, clever, keeps people from playing games, and he's a funny guy everyone likes to join," he explains.
"The younger players also must have had fun with him this week. It must be fun to watch.
He will bring as much more to the team as he will just bet on the game."
Captain Thomas Bjorn of the European team knows how long a lead can disappear quickly
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that Ryder Cup's leading position before the last day's doubles can become a rough trip.
The Danish player made his debut in 1997 in Valderram, where Seve Ballesteros's leading side had a five-point lead vis-à-vis the Americans, but who survived winning on the turkey lines just in time and just in time and won with the highest possible margin141⁄2-131⁄2.
"It reminds us of how we led the team in Valderram, we led a lot in Brookline, where we lost, but we won in Valderram, although scarcely," said Bjorn after looking at the 5-3 wins of the 2018 team both on Friday and yesterday, moving to the 10-6 cordon on Le Golf National.
History will show me and all the other members of the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow we'll shoot with a big caliber.
We're going to the airport and we're doing everything right.
The game won't be over until the numbers are on the table.
We have a goal, we are trying to win that prize, and we are only aiming for it.
As I have always said, I will focus on these 12 players who play on our side. However, we are aware of what is on the other side: the best players in the world."
Happy to see how his team's players have done their hard work on the field, Bjorn adds: "I will never lick until I drop on such things.
Tomorrow is completely different.
Tomorrow, individual performances will be a priority, and then we will talk about different things.
It is wonderful to be in the field with a partner when everything goes well, but when the field is alone, the player's capacity will be tested at the bottom.
This is a message that needs to be conveyed to players – tomorrow everyone will be able to achieve the best performance.
Now we have to give up a partner who can also go to [to the field alone] and do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, the opponent's captain Jim Furyk will be required to perform better by his players as individuals than they were able to do as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points out of four.
Furyk, on the other hand, has experienced the final day's full translations in both directions. He was involved in the team that won in Brookline before he ended up as a loser when the European team won the Medinah miracle.
"I remember every word of the devil", he answered the question of how Captain Ben Crenshaw of the 1999 team handed out the lines of his team to the last day's trials.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start just as it happened in Brookline, or as it did in Medinah.
When you move it in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the mid-games.
We have laid down our composition accordingly, and we will put the boys in the field in the way we want, as you know, we will do miracles tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead a defense fight and he will meet Rory McIllroy in the main game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will be next to meet their European opponents.
"I put the group's guys in this order because I think it's carrying the whole tournament," Bjorn commented on his choice of doubles.
Germany's new warship is delaying again
The German fleet's latest fregatta should have been introduced in 2014. The purpose of the ship is to replace the obsolete fleet during the Cold War, but it will be introduced at the earliest next year due to defective systems and explosively increasing costs, with local media reporting.
According to the military press that spoke to Die Zeit, the first vessel in Baden-Württemberg, ‘Rheinland-Pfalzin’, the new Baden-Württemberg, has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but worrying after-delivery problems have persecuted an ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships ordered by the fleet in 2007 are intended to replace the ageing Bremen class fregates.
According to the available data, they are equipped with an efficient cannon, missile systems for the fight against aircraft and surface ships, as well as tailing technology, such as radar reflectivity and infrared and acoustic signals.
The important features of the ship also include a longer maintenance interval – new fregates should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without occasionally going to the port of origin.
However, continuing delays mean that the high-tech warships – which are said to improve German influence in the overseas regions – are already obsolete as they enter the service, says Die Zeit.
The bad luck F125 fregatta ended up in headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to deploy the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet will return the vessel after it has been delivered.
The reasons for the return are little known, but the German media has spoken of essential "software and equipment errors" that make the warship unfit for combat tasks.
Software deficiencies are particularly important because Baden-Württemberg class ships have a crew size of about 120, which is only half of the crew of the older Bremen class.
It was also found that the vessel was significantly overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the fleet’s chances for subsequent updates.
It is believed that Rhineland-Pfalz with a capacity of 7 000 tonnes will be twice as heavy as German ships in the second world war.
In addition to defective equipment, there is also a problem with the entire project price base.
The price is multiplied by an increase of EUR 3.1 billion, with an initial price of EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the introduction of new fregates have emerged when the German maritime power has recently been warned to shrink.
Mr Bartels, Director of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, pointed out earlier this year that the fleet's usable ships "are running low".
According to the Authority, the problem has grown over time due to the elimination of old ships, but no new ones have been submitted.
He complained that no fregate of the Baden-Württemberg class could be introduced into the fleet.
The environmental organization is eavesdropping on the secret life of bats
A new study carried out in the outskirts of Scotland seeks to find out how bats use the landscape when hunting for food.
New research is expected to bring new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and to guide them in future protection measures.
Research carried out by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will cover the areas of the Inverewe Garden, which will be monitored by the National Trust for Scotland.
In the study, special storage devices will be placed on important points in the area in order to monitor the activities of bats during the season.
The organisation’s employees and volunteers will also carry out mobile measurements using portable observation equipment.
The frequency of the votes and the species concerned shall be ensured by expert analysis.
On the basis of the results, a bio-environment map and report will be drawn up where bat behavior can be presented in an image that respects the size of the area.
Rob Dewar, the organisation's nature conservation advisor, hopes to reveal the results which areas of the living environment are the most important for bats, and how they are exploited by different species.
Information is useful in the planning of habitat areas, such as the creation of meadows and the management of forest areas, taking into account bats and associated species.
The bat populations in Scotland and the whole of Great Britain have decreased considerably over the past hundred years.
Construction and agricultural work threatens the resting places and habitats of bats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also constitute a risk, as can flypapers and certain chemicals used in building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, because of the overnight hunting methods, their ears are more useful in catching catches than with the eyes.
Bats use advanced echo positioning technology to detect insects and obstacles on their flight path.
National Trust for Scotland is an organisation focusing on the protection of the rural environment, which maintains more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76 000 hectares across the country – and they take bats seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly carry out surveys, checks at rest and, in some cases, rescue measures for animals.
The organisation has even established the first and only area dedicated to the protection of bats in Scotland in the countries of the Dumfries and Galloway Manor of Threave. Eight of the 10 bat oils in Scotland are located in the region.
The farm manager David Thompson says the area is ideal for bats.
"Threave fits bats very well," he says.
"We have old buildings and trees and, overall, a good living environment.
The bats are not all known yet, so our work here and in other parts of the organization will help us to understand better what bats need to succeed."
He stresses the importance of checking the buildings for bats before entering the refurbishment, since the elimination of one bat’s resting place may unintentionally result in the death of up to 400 female bats and pups and the destruction of a whole local population.
bats are protected animals and are prohibited from killing, disrupting or destroying resting places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the bat protection organization, encourages the public to participate in the protection work.
He says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we still don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo denies rape charges while lawyers are preparing a case against the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has stamped rape charges against him as "false news" and says people want to "proclaim themselves" using his name.
Ronaldo's lawyers have taken action to file claims to challenge the German magazine Der Spiegel.
The attackers of Portugal and Juventus have been accused of the rape of an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a hotel in Lasvegasi in 2009.
He is said to have paid the victim 375 000 dollars for his silence, Der Spiegel reports on Friday.
The 33-year-old footballer strongly rejected the accusations and described them as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today, false news," said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They just want to advertise themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, it's part of this profession.
I am a happy man and everything is fine," the player continued smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing for the trial of Der Spiegel for claims that they have called the Reuters News Office "unqualified to report any suspicions of privacy protection".
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the player is demanding compensation for "spiritual suffering according to the seriousness of the infringement, which probably means the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged case is said to have occurred in June 2009 in the suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorga are reported to have met in a nightclub and moved to the player's room, where he is said to have raped this in an anal way, according to the papers submitted to the local court in Nevada, Clark County.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo landed on his knees after the alleged event and said that he was a 99% good guy, but whose "one percent" was disappointing.
According to the papers, Ronaldo has confirmed that a couple had had sex, but it was a mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims to have visited the police station and taken photographs of her injuries in the hospital, but later concluded a compromise because she was "scared about the possibility of revenge" and concerned about "becoming the subject of public humiliation".
A 34-year-old says he is now seeking to repeal the conciliation procedure because he is still traumatised by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was near the agreement to move to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged coup in Manchester United, and moved to the Italian power team in Juven with an agreement of $100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would "come to regret forever" the end of car manufacturing
The United Kingdom would be "forever" if it lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after the Brexite, Minister of Economic Affairs Greg Clark said.
He added that he considered it "to be a concern" to the announcement by the British department in Tokyo to temporarily suspend production at its plant near Derby, Burnaston, if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement.
"We need a deal," Clark says.
A Japanese car manufacturer says that the impact of restrictions on visible job losses will be felt if brexit is concluded without an agreement.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures the Auris and Avensis models of Tokyo, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the European Union.
"It is my view that if Britain suddenly leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be interruptions in the production of our factory," says Marvin Cooke, CEO of the Toyotan Burnaston Unit.
Other car manufacturers in Britain, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears of leaving the European Union in terms of how cross-border trade will operate.
BMW, for example, has announced that it will shut down the Mini factory for a month when the brexite is being implemented.
The main concern is that the car manufacturers report that the risks associated with the supply chain are affected by the implementation of the non-contractual brexitis.
The Tokyo production line is run in a timely manner using the JOT principle, where parts arrive at the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers in the United Kingdom and the EU, and cars are made from order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without the agreement on 29 March, it can cause disruptions at the border, which, according to the sector, could result in delays and shortages.
It is impossible for the Derbyshire plant to keep a storage facility for more than 24 hours, according to Tokyo, and production would be suspended.
Clark says that Theresa May's EU relations plan is "a precise calibration of these checks at the border".
"We need an agreement. We want the best possible agreement, which not only means success in the current situation, but is an opportunity that we need to take advantage of," he says in the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
"Not only does the statements by the Tokyos, but also by other manufacturers, show that we absolutely need to be able to continue the series of very well-functioning supply chains up to now."
Tokyo cannot tell how long production will be stopped, but it warns that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the institution and ultimately cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and has worked as a trade union agent at the factory, says that there is a growing concern among members: "The jobs lost in my experience will never come back.
The government informant says: "We must present a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Meeting Trump with Rosenstein may delay again, White House announces
The challenging meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein may be "to be moved yet a week" to the Supreme Court referee around Brett Kavanaugh for a velvo due to the obligation, the White House announced on Sunday.
Mr Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who, in turn, investigates Russia's involvement in the elections, Trump's contacts with Russia and any action by the President to prevent justice.
For months now, Washington has heard Trump's intention to fire the Deputy Minister of Justice, jeopardizing the impartiality of Mueller's investigation.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported to Rosenstein’s discussions on the possibility of secretly recording discussions with Trump and the possibility of separating the President from the US Constitution on the basis of Appendix 25.
Rosenstein has denied the report.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting was to speak of Rosenstein’s resignation.
However, President Trump was then visiting the United Nations in New York, so Thursday was announced.
Trump said that he would 'not prefer' to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because its date coincided with the hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of him, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI against Kavanaugh, which continued to postpone the vote in the Senate plenary.
Trump's press chief Sarah Sanders was in Fox News's Sunday show.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, Sanders said, "The number of days this is not set. It could be next week, this week, it can be postponed even more than a week due to everything else, what is going on in the Supreme Court at the moment.
But I always want to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists might disagree with this argument: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since 10 September.
Newsgirl Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders says that the reason for the lack of press conferences is due to reasons other than the disapproval of the 'seekery' of TV providers, but nevertheless said: 'I am not denying the fact that they are obsessive.'
However, Sanders indicated that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President holds more questions than any president before him," he says, and adds more evidence of the quote book, "We've checked those numbers."
"The press events will still be organised", Sanders said, but "it is far better if the media have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States than to talk to me.
We are often trying to do this and you have seen us do this many times over the last few weeks, and this will replace the press release so that you can speak directly to the President of the United States."
Trump will regularly answer questions when leaving the White House or taking part in open events or press conferences with valuers.
The performance alone at a press conference is rare.
This week, in New York City, the president may have indicated a reason for this to occur uninhibitedly and from time to time for strangely assembled journalists.
The Minister for Health wrote a letter to workers from EU countries in the Scottish Public Health System (NHS Scotland) regarding the fears of brexit
The Minister of Health has written a letter to the workers of the Scottish health system from EU countries in order to express their gratitude and wish to remain in the country after the brexite.
Jeane Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter while the United Kingdom has less than six months left to resign from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already planned to cover the costs of applications made by EU citizens working on specialised public services.
In his letter, Freeman writes as follows: During the summer divorce negotiations between Great Britain and the EU have continued towards the expected decisions in the autumn.
The United Kingdom Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible non-contractual distinction.
I know these are uncertain times for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat now how much we appreciate the contribution of each of our workers to citizenship.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie due to major trauma
Christion Abercrombie, a supporter of Tennessee State Tigers, has been in emergency surgery since the loss of the team from 31 to 27 Vanderbilt Commodors on Saturday, reports Tennessea supplier Mike Organ.
Tennessee State's head coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury occurred just before the halftimes.
"He came to the sideline and he just snuck into it," Reed says.
Coachs and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the side of the border before they set him up for couples and took him to the side for a more accurate assessment.
Tennessee State's agent told the WSMV channel supplier Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information on the type/band of infringement at this stage" and that the Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a second-year student at Tennessee State University and plays the first round in the team after his transfer from Illinois.
He had five hits on Saturday before he left the game, which makes a total of 18 hits this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy real estate in Great Britain
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy real estate in Great Britain. The extra money will be used as planned by the Conservative Party to help the homeless.
The aim of the amendment is to neutralise Corby's success in attracting young voters
The increase in the tax on stamps applies to those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Finance expects up to £120 million a year – to help the homeless
Theresa May will inform you today about the higher tax rate of foreign buyers when they buy real estate in Great Britain. The extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters. Corby has made promises about cheaper housing and paid attention to the taxation of those with income.
The raising of the stamp tax will be directed at people and companies who do not pay taxes in Great Britain, and the additional money will be channelled to the government's efforts to help the homeless.
The additional charge – which is added to the current stamp tax two years ago in addition to the increases in secondary housing and investment housing – may be up to three per cent.
The Minister of Finance expects an increase of up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London will be purchased by non-UK residents, which will increase prices and make it difficult for first-occupation buyers to access housing markets.
Many wealthy areas in Great Britain, especially in its capital, have become ‘a ghost cities’ because many foreign property owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new trend will only come weeks after Boris Johnson presented a reduction in the tax rate as a means of facilitating the purchase of young people’s first-occupied dwellings.
He accused the large construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by buying land and not building it, and he called on Prime Minister May to abandon the quotas for affordable housing in order to correct the 'hot situation' in Britain.
Corby has published a remarkable series of proposals to reform the housing market, including the restrictions on rents and the abolition of "intellectual exclusions".
He would also like to give the councils more power over matters related to the construction of new housing.
Prime Minister May says: "I said last year I was going to own the British dream of my Prime Minister's age – that every generation's life should be better than that of its predecessors.
This means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right for people who do not live in Great Britain, as well as foreign companies to buy housing as easily as British residents.
Too many people have become too distant a dream to own a home, and the shame of homelessness remains a fact."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish national team"
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his "permanent goal" is to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is excited about his challenge of raising the north-east corner of the country back to his feet. Currently, the team is in third place in the British Second Division.
Ross moved to the "light stadium" this summer after he directed St Mirren back to the Scottish electoral age last season.
"As a player, I wanted to play on my country's team.
I got on team two and it was there," Ross says in the BBC: Scotland's Sportssound.
"When I was a child, I often watched games with my father in Scotland at the Hampden, and that's something that's always pulled me back.
This kind of opportunity will only be met if I succeed as a company manager."
Ross' predecessors include Dick Advocates, David Moyes, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says that he was not concerned about entering his nominal predecessors' boots in nominal company, who has previously rejected the offers made by Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
"At this moment, I will measure my own success by whether I can restore this association to the electoral time.
Based on the structure and the capacity of the Society, it is undoubtedly part of the Valioli time," he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably think I'd be successful only if I could shoot the team back in the Valioli time."
Ross has only been a manager for three years: first he is assistant director of Dumbarton and then for 15 months in the Heat training group.
After that, he helped Alloo to rise from the third series of falling games and raised St Mirren’s state of fall to be champions during the next season.
Ross says he feels better now than ever during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic teams.
"I was probably in a real road trip with my career," he recalls the time when he took the lead on Allo.
"I really thought I was better suited to be a manager than a player.
It sounds strange because I played well, made a little bit of money and enjoyed some relatively great successes.
But playing can be tough.
The player has to deal with a variety of things every week.
I'm still going through the same things, like stress and pressure from work, but running the team seems like the right thing to do.
I always wanted to lead a team, and now I'm doing it for work, and I feel better in my own body than ever in my adult life."

The heat wave of the summer has given fire to pubs struggling with Britain’s difficulties, but at the same time has put more pressure on the restaurants chains.
According to statistics, sales of pub and bar chains increased by 2.7 per cent during July, but the revenue from restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin's business consultant from CGA, who compiled the figures, says: "Sustained sunny weather and England's longer-term participation in the football World Cup meant that July made pub sales like June 2.8% higher, while the month was even worse for restaurants.
The fall of 1.8% in the sales of restaurants only deteriorated in July.
The pubs and bars focused on the drinking side were the most successful. Their like-for-like sales increased more than the fall in the sales of restaurants.
Pubs focused on the food side also suffer from heat, but less dramatically than restaurants' spinners.
It looks like people just wanted to drink out of their minds.
Sales of pubs and bars run by companies increased by 6.6% over a month, and the sales of food were down by 3%."
Paul Newman of the RSM company providing leisure and hotel restaurant services says: "The results continue to develop, which has continued since the end of April.
Weather and major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors affecting the sale of the external catering market.
It is no surprise that the struggle against food chains continues, although the fall in annual sales of 4.8% is particularly striking now that the sector is currently struggling with cost pressures.
A long hot summer could not have come to the operators who were concentrated in the worse staff, and only time would show if the brighter temperatures of the films brought the sector into a painfully needed rest period.
In July, the combined total sales growth of pubs and restaurants, including new opened restaurants, was 2.7%, reflecting a slowdown in the creation of new brands.

One-fifth of the children secretly conceal social media accounts from their parents
A fifth of children – some of whom are up to 11 years of age – hide social media accounts from their parents and teachers, says research
A study of 20,000 upper secondary schools revealed the existence of an increasing ‘Instagram feic accounts’ phenomenon
The news raised concerns about the possibility of sharing sexual content with accounts
20 per cent of pupils reported to be holding a ‘head account’ shown to parents
A fifth of children, some of whom are up to 11 years old, create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 upper secondary schools revealed the rapidly growing existence of ‘Instagram feic accounts’, which refers to the Instagram site for the distribution of images.
News has raised fears that accounts can be published on sexual content.
20 per cent of the students reported that they considered the cleaned ‘head’ account to be shown to parents while using other private accounts.
A mother found messages written by a teenager in which she hoped to be raped after colliding with her 13 - year - old daughter's secret site.
In a study carried out by the Digital Software UK and the Rehtoirs Conference (HMC), 40% of young people aged 11-18 kept two separate profiles and half of respondents admitted to keeping secret accounts.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan says: "It is alarming that so many teenagers feel attracted to setting up online facilities where parents and teachers can't find them."
From Eilith Doyle, "the voice of athletes" to the government of Scottish athletes
Eilith Doyle has been elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish sportsmanship, taking part in the annual general meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is the most awarded athlete in Scotland, and the President of the Board, Ian Beattie, describes the title as an excellent opportunity for sports decision-makers to benefit from the wide-ranging international experience of the athlete during the last decade.
I am sure that Scottish athletes would benefit enormously from his appointment to the government, says Beattie.
Doyle says, "I look forward to my role as the sound of athletes, and I hope that I can be of benefit and help guide Scottish sport in the right direction."
Four olympic athletes who won 200 metres and 400 metres of trips in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, now acting as a permanent commentator of the BBC, lost their walking power as a result of a passing brain circulation.
He wrote on Twitter, "A month ago I had a stroke."
I couldn't walk.
Doctors say it's only time for me to get better and better.
This has been an exhausting job, but I have recovered completely, learned to walk again, and I am already training agile!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
An advertisement that resembles mothers cows distributes opinions online
The company that makes chest pumps breast-feeding mothers in the same way as dairy cows has shared opinions on the Internet.
Elvie, who manufactures consumer technology, has placed on the market a product called "the world's first silent and wearable breast pump". Its marketing will be speeded up by an advertisement made in the cheek and adapted to the style of music videos, which describes the freedom of mothers who suck the new pump.
The four mothers of real-life dance in the navet filled by the rings, among other things, in the following song: "Yes, I milk myself, but there's no tail" and "If you didn't notice, they're not the mistletoes, but it's the tits."
The story continues: "Put it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk my inventions."
However, the advertisement published on the company's Facebook page caused the debate online.
The video that has collected 77 000 hits and hundreds of comments has triggered a conflicting reaction in the viewers. Many say it will ruin the dairy industry’s daily ‘horror’.
"The use of cows in advertising this product was a very bad decision.
They must become pregnant and be given birth in order to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them shortly after delivery," one commentator writes.

Another viewer commented: "Obviously, it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why can't they be used to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
The third commentator added: "A total-required advertising of reality."
I also received ads for defenders: a woman admitted that she thought the ad was "happy".
"I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one of those if I were still breast-feeding.
I felt like a cow when I was pumping.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I took it the way it is.
This is a brilliant product," reads one of the comments.
Another viewer commented: "This is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who (most of the time in the workplace or in the toilets) and feel like cows".
The purpose of the advertisement is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the commercial, the women in the video reveal that they have danced unobtrusive pumps in their bras, flattened.
The concept of an advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women using breast pumps feel like cows.
The elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires and hoses, and it is unobtrusively suitable in the breast-feeding vests, which gives women the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go outside while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and artistic director of Mother advertising, commented: "Elvie pump is a revolutionary product that earned bold and provocative income on the market.
By breast-feeding mothers and dairy cows we wanted to bring all the challenges of using the chest pump into the light beam, we brought out the incredible feeling of freedom brought by the new pump in an entertaining and identical way."
The Elvis pump has reached the headlines before.
In London’s fashion weeks, the mother of two children appeared in catwalk as designer Marta Jakubowski’s outfit using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children have been transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border in all silence
The number of children of migrant origin has increased sharply, despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, due to the difficulties in investing children in families as a result of the harsh rhetoric and politics introduced by the Trump regime.
Most foster families are traditionally made up of paperless immigrants, and registration as a foster family can jeopardise their own residence in the country.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential families and other adult members of the economy had to give their fingerprints and that this information would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a high-level immigration and customs authority, proved last week in Congress that the Agency arrested dozens of people who had applied for foster families for minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 % of the detainees had no previous criminal record.
"Almost 80% of people who are either members of the foster family or members of their households are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are criminals.
So we're going to continue looking for these people," says Albence.
In an effort to deal with child cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules to deal with a case before the Court of Justice within one month of the time limit of 60 days previously used, and the staff of the reception centre report.
Many people prefer videoconferencing rather than personalising their case in a court dealing with the cases of immigrants.
Those who are not considered entitled to assistance shall be immediately deported.
According to recent reports from the reception centres’ staff and the system’s last months, the time spent in prison for children affects whether children start suffering from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to escape.
According to lawyers, concern is particularly highlighted in larger institutions, such as the Tornill, where signs of child despair can be missed due to the large size of the institution.
They add that the transfer of children to tent cities without being given enough time to prepare for it emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma, and that many children already suffer from traumas.
Syria tells the United States, France and Turkey to leave immediately
At the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the country has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who also acts as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign troops are illegally in the country, using the pretext of the fight against terrorism, and that 'they will act accordingly'.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed that "the war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died in 2011 and beyond, and that millions of people have been forced to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "sacred battle until the whole of Syria has been cleansed" of both terrorist organisations and illegal alien troops.
The United States has around 2,000 soldiers in Syria, where they are mainly training and guiding the Kurds and the Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has invested battles to tear up more than 1 000 soldiers' divisions.
As regards the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were good for return and accused the "some Western countries" of spreading irrational fears which encourage refugees to stay out of the country.
"We have invited the international community and assistance organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicalizing something that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid for reconstruction will be granted to Syria before the end of the war by political agreement between Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone at the last base of the rebels in Idlib has created the opportunity to conduct political discussions.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia on the territory of three million people.
However, Moualem has stressed that the agreement has "clear time limits" and expressed the wish that military action would target the jihadists, including those in the al-Nusra front, "who will be destroyed".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon be able to bring together the first meetings of the new government and opposition committee for the establishment of the post-war Syrian Constitution and to pave the way for the elections.
Moualem laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that its work should be limited to "reviewing the provisions of the current Constitution" and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will be selected for the second season
According to this logic, President Trump would win the 2020 elections if, as many liberal observers are likely to hope, the election and the scandal were to end his term early.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic Presidency decision ever!"
No signs of fatigue have been observed so far in the viewers.
Since 2014, the best viewing time figures have more than doubled with CNN to 1.05 million and almost tripled with 1.6 million MSNBC.
According to Fox News, there are 2.4 million viewers in the best viewing time compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the Rachel Maddow Show at MSNBC has reached the peak of 3.5 million viewers on the main news evenings.
"This is a grass that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," says Neal Baer, the main producer of ABC Designed Surveyor, from the Minister, who will rise up as president after the attack has destroyed the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, who is an experienced comedy writer and the book Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club author, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told me he was going to vote for Trump.
Scovell asked why.
The driver said, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell says.
The chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike other TV programs, news from Washington can determine how Roe vs Wade goes about whether members of immigrant families get to each other and how the world economy can.
Immediateness is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond the duty of a conscious citizen to look at a six-hour expert panel arguing about the use of Bob Woodward's source data for the Fear book, Paul Manafort's $15 000 ossytskin jacket ( According to the Washington Post, "the presumptuous piece of clothing") and the consequences of the unpretentious descriptions of Stormy Daniels' anatomy of Trump's President.
For example, I will never again be able to watch Super Mario the same way I used to.
"What he's doing seems like a real TV show, because it's partly about giving something to the public every night," says Wheelhouse Entertainment Director and Pantilainamo series creator Brent Montgomery Trump's show's changing characters and daily changing plots (NFL rice, Kim Jong-un's praise).
You can't miss a single episode, or you'll fall off the track.
When I got to Mr. Fleiss this week, he had a lovely sunny day on the north coast of Kauai, but he couldn't go out because he was watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not withdraw from the programme in which Brett Kavanaugh was before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs and was the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

It is not surprising that the 17th constituency of Pennsylvania has been faced with a real cash flow, since the restructuring of the Congressional Circles has led to the fight against two candidates already elected from one place.
This recently redefined constituency in Pittsburgh is a battle challenge for the Democratic Conor Lamb, which was the place of the second constituency in last spring's special elections.
Lamb will compete with another elected candidate, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th constituency of Pennsylvania, which is overlapping with the new 17th constituency.
The division was re-imposed after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old electoral division favoured Republicans in violation of the Constitution.
Competition in the new 17 parliamentary districts has been launched by the Financial Directorates of the main economic parties at the Democratic Campaign Congressional Commission (DCCC) and at the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name of the Lamb came to be known in Pennsylvania after the special elections of the 18th Congressional election in Pennsylvania.
The place had been a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won 20% in the region.
Political commentators have given the Democrats a fine head start.
The United States planned to punish El Salvador for supporting China but withdrew its intention
The diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already quoted the situation in Beijing and the mild response in Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and he also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners deported the Trump Organization Group's management team.
Officials of the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs decided to call the American diplomat leaders back from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of the "slow guidelines according to which Taiwan will no longer be recognised", said the department informant Heather Nauert earlier this month.
However, penalties were only considered for El Salvador, which received an estimated 140 million dollars of aid from the United States in 2017, including drug control, and development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been seriously hit by the Central American state with a high rate of unemployment and life-threatening crime.
As internal meetings progressed, the North and Central American authorities postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity.The corresponding meeting of the previous year was seen as a step in attempts to prevent immigrants from reaching the United States.
However, in mid-September, the high administrative officials made it clear that the meeting would be desired to proceed and that this effectively concluded speculation on the possible punishment of El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now expected to give a kind of signal to the mid-October meeting about the importance of the administration of assembly, the diplomats stated.
These three American ambassadors returned in silence to El Salvador, Panama, and Dominican Republic without new bad messages or punishments from Washington.
The informant of the White House of Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate with three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal matters anonymously.
Their report was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also spoke to protect anonymity.
History teaches
The next inevitable step may be the report by Special Lawyer Robert Mueller on the possible prevention of President Trump's right, which is now very serious evidence in public documents.
Mueller has also reported on the directional investigation into whether Trump’s campaign secretly cooperated with Russia when Russia intervened in the US elections.
If there is a change of power in Congress, President Trump will find that he is accountable to it just as he is preparing to go again before his voters and will possibly be judged equally.
There are many voicings here, and I do not mean to say that the loss of President Trump would be inevitable - neither will the loss of people in Europe who are the same.
We must make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic and those decisions determine how far this struggle will be.
In 1938 the German authorities would have been ready to flee Hitler’s power if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the bloodbath of the years that followed.
The course of history goes around such turning points, where the inevitable march of democracy is either accelerating or delayed.
The Americans are now facing a number of such turning points.
What do we do if President Trump fires Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for investigating the Mueller case?
Rosenstein has been polished since the public found out that he had proposed the secret record of the President's speech and thought about the President's possible inability to handle his mission.
Rosenstein said the Times report was a mistake.
"How do we react if the newly required FBI investigation into Brett Kavanugh's activities is not complete or fair, or if she is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite the credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote for Congress in the mid-terms that considers President Trump responsible?
If we fail at these times, our democracy will be in a long and dark winter.
But I believe our success is due to my lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew, and she was banished to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once filled my diplomatic home.
He survived, moved to America as a immigrant and sent me 60 years later to light the Sabbath candles on that table decorated by the hakarist.
How could this heritage be more than optimistic about the future?"

Rangers Graham Dorrans as an optimist for the Rapid Wien encounter
The Rangers will meet at their home on Thursday, knowing that, after a match against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, a victory over the Austrians would give the team a strong position to get into the European League G section.
The knee injury prevented the midfield player Graham Dorrans from entering the field this season before the Villarreal 2-2, but he believes that the Rangers can use that result as a stepping board for better results.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good answer", a 31-year-old player notes.
"We went to the game with the expectation that we could get something and bring a point with us.
Perhaps we could have caught the end of the win, but overall the game is probably a fair result.
They must have been better in the first half, and we got to the second half, and we were better.
Thursday is another important evening in the European League.
I hope we get three points, but it will be a tough game, because their results were good in the previous game. However, I believe that with the support of this group, we will be able to give everything and achieve a positive result.
Last year was really tough on my own injuries and changes on the team, but now it feels good.
The assembly is good and the boys enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope we can press it full now, leave the past season behind us and succeed."
Fear of pension savings takes women to sleep at night
Although the participants had a clear view of how they wanted to take care of themselves, few had spoken about it to their loved ones.
About half of the participants in the global study reported that they were discussing the costs of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10% of respondents said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it," says Holly Snyder, Vice President of the National Life Insurance Company.
Start like this.
Talk to your spouse and your children: you cannot prepare your family to care for you unless you tell us about your wishes in time.
Talk to the professional and your family about where and how to get help, as these issues are an important factor in determining the costs.
Take economic advice into discussion: advice can also help to find a way to cover these costs.
Financial options for long-term care may include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance to cover these costs, or cost-effective insurance, if you can afford.
Legal documents: prevent legal disputes.
Get a health care representative in place so that you can appoint a trusted person to supervise your medical treatment and ensure that professionals follow your wishes in case you are unable to communicate with them.
Consider also the creation of a proxy for the treatment of your financial interests.
It allows you to determine the person you trust to take care of your financial decisions and to ensure that your invoices are paid if you cannot take care of them yourself.
Also remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent would be on his way to the hospital because of a health emergency.
Could you answer questions about his medication and allergies?
Please enter such information in the plan so that you are prepared for the situation.
"This isn't just a matter of economics, who's his doctor?" Martin asks.

Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep the plan ready."
He was shot several times with an air gun in Ilframbe.
A man was shot several times with an air gun when he walked home late at night.
The victim was about 40 years old in the area of Ilfracombe Oxford Grove in Devon when he was shot in the chest, abdomen, and arm.
The police describe the attack that took place around 2:30 p.m. as a "sacred act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The victim's injuries are not life threatening, and the police have appealed to witnesses.
Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the city of Please on Friday in Indonesia. According to the authorities, the number of victims is expected to increase.
Due to the lack of communication, the rescue authorities have not received any information from the municipality of Donggala, north of the city of Donggala, which is closer to the surface centre of the 7.5 magnetic shock.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated.
Key information about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawes:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawes, located at a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawes, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The earthquake and tsunami struck the city during the 40th anniversary.
The municipality of Donggala extends over 300 kilometres (180 miles) to the north-west coast of the island of Sulawes.
The municipality of Donggala is an administrative district under the province, whose population was estimated at 299 200 in 2017.
The main industries in the economy of the central province of Sulawes, and in particular the island of Donggala, are fishing and agriculture.
The mining of nickel is also important, but it is concentrated in Morowal on the opposite coast of Sulawes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggala have struck several tsunamis in the last hundred years.
In 1938 the tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Donggal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located standing in the active Pacific Ring of Fire and is often affected by earthquakes.
Some of the most serious earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake in North Sumatra on the west coast of the province of Aceh in Indonesia caused the tsunami on December 26, which struck 14 states and killed 226 000 people on the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims were in the area of Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias in Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 Magnified quake struck the most inhabited island in Indonesia, Javan, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast of the island, killing almost 700 people.
2009: 7.6 Magnified quake struck the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 100 people were killed.
2010: 7.5 Magnetual quake struck one of the islands of Sumatra Mentawai, causing a ten-metre high tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: The superficial quake struck the area of Aceh Pidie Jaya, causing destruction and panic as people remember the enormous damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than a hundred people died as the buildings collapsed.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia and killed over 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists in isolation.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for domestic violence.
The oldest son of the former Governor and Vice-President of Alaska, Track Palin, has been arrested for assault.
According to the Alaskan police's Saturday report, Pali, 29, from Alaska, was arrested as a suspect in domestic violence and the prevention and opposition of domestic violence in the context of the arrest.
According to the police report, Palin took a phone from his female companion when he tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
The Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Investigation Court and the guarantee amount is set at 500 dollars, reporting from the TV channel KKUU.
According to the report, Palin arrived at the court on Saturday and replied that he was "extremely innocent".
The Palin is charged with three offences of Class A, which means he can receive a maximum of one year's imprisonment and a $250 000 fine.
He is also charged with a class B violation, which can be sentenced to daily imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time that the palin is accused of a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
That's when Palin's mother called the police and reported an assault.
The case is currently under discussion in Alaskan veteran law.
In January 2016, Palinia was accused of domestic violence involving possession of a weapon under the influence of drugs.
Palin's girlfriend accused him of hitting him in the face.
Veterans criticise Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to traumatized stress disorder caused by the service provided in Iraq.
Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have been killed since the earthquake struck the island of Sulawes in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5 magnetic earthquake caused the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication links are broken and the number of victims is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside the central part of Sulawes on the northeast side of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
In social media, videos are circulated at the moment of the quake.
Hundreds of people had gathered for the beach festival please in the city when the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors are considering imposing a rare death penalty on the suspect in the NYC terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are pursuing the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in eight human-sufficient terrorist attacks in New York City, a rare punishment that has not been executed in the state since the federal crime in 1953.
According to the charge, Saipov, 30, used Home Depot's rental car in the October attack on the West Side Highway, south of Manhattan, where he was driving over pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a report on the application for the death penalty in the South of New York City, the death penalty is possible if the prosecutors are able to prove that Saipov killed eight of his victims with a "intended" physical injury.
According to the Court's document, it is possible to bring the death penalty on both of these charges.
Weeks after the attack, the federal court made a 22-point charge against Saipov involving eight murders to assist the terrorist organisation, typically used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, including charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles,
The attack required "much planning and preparation", the prosecutors stated and described the way in which Saipov carried out his actions "as terrible, cruel and shameful."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, harm and loss to the families of Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damascus Pagnucco".
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
A previous decade has passed since the New York South Administrative Court delivered the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of two drug traffickers' murders but was eventually sentenced to life sentence in September 2009.
The death penalty has been last implemented in New York in the federal case in 1953, when the married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed in prison for the conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed no sign of repentance during the days and months following the attack.
He told the scientists what he did felt good, the police told him.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired by his attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
The police said Saipov also wanted an ISIS ticket to his hospital room.
He replied to a 22-point charge that he was innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal defence attorneys representing Saipov, said that the defence was a "naturally disappointed" prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand death penalty and not recognition and life sentence without the possibility of release is a solution that only prolongs the trauma caused by these events to the parties involved," said Patton.
In the past, Saipov’s defense had asked him not to be charged with the death penalty.
The Conservative MEP says that NIGEL FARAGE should be held accountable during the Brexit negotiations.
In his demonstration today, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the civil army" against the Conservatives.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians must feel the pressure of Eurosceptics - when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians proposed to lead negotiations with the EU.
To the marchers in Birmingham, the Conservative liner Peter Bone said that Britain would be "out" if Farage were a brexit secretary.
But May faces the gravely divided lines of the challenge of the conservatives in favour of staying, who were involved in a separate protest against the Brexite in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep the Chequers compromise on the surface of the Brexist supporters and opponents, as well as the EU.
The supporters asked him to continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the setback, and to force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to make a choice between his proposal and chaos.
Bone said at the "Leave Means Leave" event in Solihull that he wanted to "blow off the Chequers proposal".
He proposed that Farage be involved and should be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we'd be out by now," he said.
Mr Wellingborough's Member added: "I am defending the brexite, but we need to get rid of the Chequers proposal."
He expressed his opposition to the EU: "We did not fight World Wars to become subject to it.
We want to legislate our own laws in our own country."
Bone knocked the idea that the public opinion would have changed after the 2016 vote: "The fact that the British would have changed their minds and wanted to stay is a completely incorrect argument."
And Andrea Jenkyns, a conservative supporter of the Brexit, also took part in the march and said to the journalists: "I only say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people do not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote in favour of it, nor will it be supported by the members of the party, nor by the activists, who really go out on the streets and are responsible for our success at all.
Give up the Chequers proposal and start listening."
In a message to May, he added: "The Prime Ministers are allowed to keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage said that politicians must feel pressure if they intend to faint the decision taken on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
This is about trust between the people and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to water Brexit, and we're here today to tell them we don't accept it."
When he spoke to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want politicians who are about to roll the brexite to feel pressure from you."
"We are going to mobilise the army of the citizens of this country, who gave us victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until Britain is once again an independent, self-government and proud state."
In the meantime, the supporters of the stay marched through Birmingham before the two - hour event in the city centre.
A small group of activists were swinging the "Tories Against Brexit" sign, and the group was set up this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party mocked the conservative security problems they had with the party's application at the beginning of the meeting.
"These are the people who say they can get the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus plus plus, and smooth border operations for free trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a full farce.
There is no good brexite," he added.
Warren is seriously considering the presidential candidate.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that he is seriously considering the presidential candidate after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at the town hall in the western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is known for his repeated criticism of President Trump, will meet Geoff Diehlin of the Republican Republic in November, co-chaired the Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
Warren is thought to be a potential candidate against Trump in the 2020 elections.
Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th town hall meeting with voters after the start of Trump's season.
One of the participants asked if Warren was going to run for president.
Warren replied that it is time for women to "go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman in the highest place."
Arrest in the case of LSU Sims
On Saturday, Louisiana Baton Rouge Police reported that they arrested a person suspected of shooting on Friday by the LSU basketball team player Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge Police reported the arrest of Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. at the ET briefing.
The police had released a video of the shooting scene on Friday and asked for help to identify the man in it.
Sims, 20, shot near Southern University campus area early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims got a bullet wound to his head and died as a result," Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through the 247 Sports network.
Wayde defended his friend when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted he was in the interrogations, held a gun and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson didn't do anything when he was arrested, and he was taken to East Baton Rouge Police Station.
Sims was a 198-inch junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games and 10 in the start of the last season and his average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 balls per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after the team arrangements offered him victory over Sebastian Vettet
When Valtteri Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became evident that the Mercedes team arrangements were important in competition.
Bottas got a good departure from the stake and left Hamilton with almost his own luck in defending his place in the first two rounds, inviting Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel went to the dumpster first and left Hamilton driving a bunch of tails, which should have been resolved.
Mercedes went to the shelter later and returned after Vettel, but Hamilton passed after a bit of contact and, consequently, after the Ferrari driver moved from the inner line, giving up his position after two thirds of the movement.
The 21-year-old Max Verstappen who spent his 21st birthday began from the back row and was the seventh after the first round.
After that, he was led by a large part of the competition as he prolonged the exchange of tyres in the direction of a quick end and a fourth place from Kimi Räikkös.
He finally came to the crow in the 44th round, but he was unable to increase the speed of the remaining eight rounds of Räikkösen when he took the fourth place.
It was a difficult day, because the Master did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman when he let me by.
The team has done an exceptional job to achieve a double victory," Hamilton said.
Very bad body language
On Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein's claim that he did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, in which he accused the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
When speaking on the occasion in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention Mr Ford's testimony before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, but said that what was going on in the Senate was a manifestation of people's 'politicity, evil and dishonesty'.
"One possible thing, the wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate for the last few days, when we see anger, people who are angry, mean, evil and dishonest," said the President.
"When we see publications and bedded things and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, do you have this information?
Do you remember his answer... did you have a document - ‘ Oh, my God, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't bleed."
Wait a minute.
Did we... no, we didn't leak," he added to the senator's curse.
In July Feinstein received a letter describing the charges against Ford Kavanaugh and the letter was published in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have taken place from his office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's accusations, and I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told the committee according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential according to his wishes."
But his ban was not acceptable to the President, who commented on it on Saturday's occasion: "I would say to you that was very poor body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continued to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual harassment by three women and thought the Democrats would use the charges for their own benefit.
"They have decided to return to power by any means necessary.
You see that evil and evil, and they don't care who they hurt or who they have to walk over to gain power and control," Mediaite reports the president.

The pilot died making sure hundreds of passengers on the plane escaped the earthquake.
In Indonesia, the pilot has become a hero since his death in ensuring that the plane carrying hundreds of passengers entered the air safely.
Over 800 people have died and several are missing since the severe earthquake and the tsunami caused by it hit the island of Sulawes on Friday.
Strong excavations test the area and many people have been trapped in the trapped material in the city of Please.
Although colleagues fled their lives through the shop, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21-year-old, did not leave his job in a wildly glowing air traffic control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He maintained his position and made sure that Batik Air's flight, which was currently on the runway, had a safe access to the air.
Then he jumped out of a flight control tower he thought was falling.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia’s informant Yohannes Sirait stated that Agung’s decision could save hundreds of lives, reported in Australia’s ABC News.
Kalimantan, Balikpapan, was manufactured to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"This news breaks our heart," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of victims will increase to thousands because the country’s disaster authorities have announced that there are insufficient links with the cities of Donggala, Sig and Boutong.
"It is believed that there is still an increase in the number of victims, because several bodies are buried in ruins and many people have not been reached," Sutopo Purwo, the agency informs.
As many as six - foot [6 m] - old waves have destroyed Please, where a mass funeral is held on Sunday.
Military and cargo machinery bring assistance and equipment to the area.

Are you ready?" CNN news.
Earlier this year, more than 550 people were killed in earthquakes in Lombok, Indonesia.
Micronesia accident: Air Niugin says one person is missing after a plane crash in the lagoon.
In Micronesia, representatives of an aircraft flying into the lagoon in the Pacific Sea now report one person missing, although according to previous reports all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated safely from a sinking plane.
According to Air Niugin, it hasn't been able to locate one male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline indicated that it was trying to find a man in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and accident investigators.
The airline did not immediately answer any further information on the missing passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water in an attempt to land at Chuuk airport.
On Friday, the authorities reported that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
According to the airline, six people stayed in the hospital on Saturday and everyone was stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact course of events are still unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. fleet have reported the plane landing in the lagoon before the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane ran over the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
"It's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
According to Jaynes, passengers were able to chain on a sinking plane in a belt - deep water for emergency exits.
He said that the passenger staff was panicking and screaming, and that he himself had a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that the sailors in the repair work of the nearby dock were involved in rescues by transporting people to the shore by rubber boat before the plane sank about 30 metres (a hundred feet) deep into the water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have been killed by airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but Air Niugini has not been involved.
Analyst poses a timeline for the night she was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution completed a reprocessing trial whereby a man was accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he had used the data stored on the mobile phone when gathering together 29-year-old accused Quinton Telli and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers' movements on the night of the victim's death.
Rowlett reported that he had received the location data of several mobile phones that indicated that Telis had been in conflict with his earlier claims with Chambers on the night of his death, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the information showed that Tellis's cell phone was at Chambers at the same time that Tellis claimed to have been with Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford proved that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford replied that Tellis "is lying because my car was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
According to the data recorded on the mobile phone, they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that at some point after Chambers' death Tellis removed Chambers' texts, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," Hale said.
The final defence speeches are planned for launch on Sunday.
The judge said he was expecting the trial to proceed to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is aware of hip hop?
Hip Hop Trio wants to challenge the negative ideas associated with the genre by making music that is full of positive messages.
According to The High Breed of Bristol, hip hop is far from the original, whose messages were related to politics and social problems.
They want to return to the roots of the hip hop and make the conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have been able to witness the new rise of Britain with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another dark man? !
New York nanny challenges a couple for racist text
The New York nanny challenges the couple's right to discriminate against a discriminatory divorce when they accidentally receive a text message from the mother of the child, in which she complains that she is "one more dark man".
The couple deny that they are racists and compare the challenge of "circumcision."
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed her regret when the new nanny Giselle Maurice arrived at work on his first working day in 2016 and she became aware that this was dark.
"EIIIII, STAY," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a text message.
But then he sent a message instead of his husband to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After he realized that he had made a mistake, Plasco-Flaxman had, according to New York Post, fired Maurice, declaring that his African-American nanny who had received their previous departure passports had done his job badly, and this time he had been waiting for the Philippines.
Maurice got paid for one day at work and was sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice is suing the couple to obtain compensation for the dismissal and wants a fee of 350 dollars per day for six months, for which she had originally been washed to live and work in the family, though without a contract.
"I want to show them that they can't do that," he said to the Post on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have responded to racist arguments, saying that the conclusion of Maurice’s employment relationship was a legitimate solution because they could not trust him after they had offended him.
"My wife sent him something he was not meant to say.
He's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco told me at the interview with Post.
"But would you leave your child in the sight of someone you've been unfriendly to, even if by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Really?"
Plasco sided with the challenge of blackmail and said that his wife had had had a baby two months earlier and was "in a very difficult situation."
"Do you want to start chasing someone in a situation like this?
It's not very comfortable," the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the public opinion has quickly condemned the couple in social media, including their behaviour and logic.
The new letter reveals that the Paddington publishers were afraid that the public would not identify the talking bear.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was approved, says from the letter: "It is difficult to live in the position of someone who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's fun now that the huge popularity of Paddington is known."
To prove that his father, who had worked as a cameraman of the BBC before devoted himself to writing children's books on the adventures of the bear, would have been optimistic about rejecting his book, Jankel added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books seemed bitter because his father died in the previous year.
He described Paddington as a very important family member and said that his father was silently proud of its success.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he wasn't a relaxing guy at all," she says.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a child's achievement to him; one you are proud of, even though it is not your own achievement.
I think he experienced Paddington's success that way.
Though it was his creation, he always gave the credit to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye on my dying daughter's phone.
Her daughter was awarded the plane after landing at the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life in vain.
"Nad called a little bit and said it was really bad that he wasn't expected to survive," Ednan-Laperous says.
Then they called and said my daughter would be dead in a few minutes and I have to say goodbye on the phone.
So I did.
I said, "I love you so much, honey.
I'll be right with you.
I'm with you."
The drugs used by doctors to keep his heart running gradually removed from his body.
He was dead a little earlier, and now it all went out.
I could just sit there knowing that everything was running out.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and other people.
I had to keep myself together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who mourned the loss of his daughter, boarded a plane among other passengers who knew nothing about the trial he was experiencing.
"No one knew," he said.
"I kept my head down, and tears were pouring all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt tremendous sympathy for Nadia.
That he now needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved my daughter."
Dead women send cards to stop suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones work hard to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are sending cards with encouraging messages and a telephone number that can be supported.
Davis' son Tyler got depressed when he was 13. He committed suicide when he was 18.
"I would not like any parent to experience the feelings I feel every day," he said.
Davis, 45, living in Lydney, says his son was a promising cook with an infectious grin.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile would illuminate the whole room."
But he quit his job before he died because he felt "in the dark".
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother found his brother, who had taken his life away from himself.
Davis says he's always afraid of the effects.
Davis created cards "to tell people that there are people you can talk to even if it's a friend.
Don't be quiet. You need to talk."
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies’s for many years, and he lost his partner since Mark’s 15 years together shortly after his mother had died.
"He didn't say he was down or depressed or anything," Humphrey said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was on the ground on Christmas Day, and when the children opened up their gifts, he didn't take a look at them or anything like that."
He says Mark's death was a difficult trauma for them, but they still have to cope with it: "It's breaking up the family.
It'll tear us apart.
But all we have to do is move on and fight for the future."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake at the start of his investigation by the FBI.
"I thought that if we could really achieve what he wanted - time and scope of limited investigation - perhaps we could achieve some unity", Mr Flake said on Saturday, and added that he was afraid that the committee would "disperse" its dead end by the supporters.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
It's a matter of timing.
The interim elections are only five weeks from November 6th, and if the Republican successes are weak as expected, their efforts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country will be difficult.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone and called the senators to lobby them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House during Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI's report is drawn up?
In the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting, a vote will take place.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, allowing Vice-President Mike Pence to blow the game and confirm his choice to the highest court.
The number of North Korean divers will fall during Kim
According to the North Korean legislator, the number of persons who have made their way to South Korea from North Korea has decreased since the takeover of Kim Jong-un seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug quoted South Korea's Ministry of Harmonisation and reported that the upgrades took place last year in 127 - in 2011 they occurred in 2,706.
According to the Park, the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the increase in the prices of human traffickers, have been key factors.
There has been no public comment on Pyongyang.
The majority of North Korea's parasites are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
From Seoul it is noted that more than 30 000 North Koreans have entered the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most people flee through China because it has the longest border with North Korea and it is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarised zone between the Koreas.
China treats giants as illegal immigrants, not as refugees, and most of them are forced to return them.
Technically speaking, relations between North Korea and South Korea in the war have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the countries met in Pyongyang, and the discussions focused on the negotiations that were being held at a time when nuclear equipment was broken.
This followed the historic meeting in June, where the US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong met in Singapore and agreed on a general approach towards the Korean Peninsula of nuclear non-proliferation.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of taking sanctions in place after the meeting.
"With no confidence in the United States of America, our national security is not on a reliable footing and under such circumstances we will in no case begin unilaterally to defuse our equipment first", Ri said to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy's fear calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court Judge, Brett Kavanaugh, "hysterical", and said this was temporarily inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court.
Your fear commented on this at the Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved like this, she would be called "hysterical"," said Pelosi of her own reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs on Thursday.
Kavanaugh very emotionally denied the accusations that he would have sexually abused Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening speech Kavanaugh was in control of his feelings and sometimes he almost cried out and lost his ability to speak when he told about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned the democratic members of the committee without calling themselves "grotesk and planned persecution against a person" organised by the liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential elections.
Your fear said that it believed that Kavanaugh’s testimony showed that he was unable to act in the Supreme Court because it showed him to be partial to the Democrats.
"I believe he made himself incompetent with his statements and in the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," said Pelosi.
He was afraid when he was asked if he would press charges against Kavanaugh if this choice was confirmed and if the Democrats had a majority in the House of Representatives.
"Let's say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not valid not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court in which he is currently working," your fear answered.
Kavanaugh is currently working at the U.S. Federal Court of Appeal.
As a Democrat, he was concerned by the possible provisions of Kavanaugh on health reform or Roe v Wade, because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative court-holder.
In the consultations on its confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would reverse certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not a good time for a hysterical and party person to be elected as a member of justice and we would expect to say that it is wonderful," Pelosi said.
Women have to survive everything.
It is a legitimate fire speech as months and years go by and he cannot hold it unscrupulous.
"We cry when we're angry," Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do I?"
He continued: "I was greatly helped by a woman who was in a leading position somewhere and who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but that she had developed a way to tell her speaker in a situation where she was angry and started crying, "You might think I'm sad now because I'm crying.
I'm really angry."
And then he just went on.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are justified as a route of decompression, although they are generally misinformed.
One of my most memorable memories of my early job in the man-power office is once I cried out of rage and an older woman, a cold-skinned superior, who I had always been a little afraid of, took me off my neck and dragged me down the stairs.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and then they're happy because they got your sorry mind."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in this presidential campaign.
When Hart caught up in an extramarital relationship on a boat called Monkey Business in 1987 and got out of the race, the very frustrated Schroeder felt that there was no reason why he didn't want to be president himself.
"It was not a very well thought-out decision," he said to me, laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven proposals and one more was least needed.
Someone called it snow and a midget at seven.
Since the campaign was already a long time ago, he was behind the fundraiser, and so he announced that he would not go to the race unless he could raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
It became clear to him that some of his supporters, who gave the male candidates a thousand dollars, gave him only 250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he thought.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not start an official campaign, he was subjected to his feelings of gratitude for his supporters, frustration into a system that made it so difficult to raise funds for electoral work against voters and delegates, and hatred for sexism - that he could not speak.
"You could have thought I was getting a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
"You could have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking that my tombstone would probably be hacked into a memoir.
‘He cried.’
How the U.S. and China Can Benefit Beijing
The launch of the US-China trade war was earening, and although the fight is nothing but past, the gap between countries can benefit Beijing in the long term, the experts say.
The U.S. President Donald Trump gave the first warning earlier this year by imposing import taxes on the main Chinese export items, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
This week, the most significant escalation occurred with new customs duties affecting imported goods for USD 200 billion (EUR 150 billion), effectively taxing half of all products imported from China to the United States.
Beijing has responded to the same rate every time, last from five to ten percent customs duties on US imports worth 60 billion dollars.
China has promised to respond to the United States with an eye-to-eye style, and it does not seem that the second largest economic power in the world is emerging even for a moment.
In order to get Washington back off, we should give up on our own demands, but publicly bowing to the United States would be far too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts point out that if Beijing is playing its cards correctly, the US trade war can have a positive impact on China in the long term by reducing interdependence.
"A little political decision can be made either in Washington or Beijing, and this is actually a more dangerous opportunity than the fellows have understood until now," says Abigail Grace, a research assistant in Asia at the Center for New American Security.
According to the Syrian Foreign Minister, the country is "ready" of the return of refugees
Syria says that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance in the reconstruction of the country after more than seven years of devastating war.
When speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country will improve.
"Your account is now more stable and safer as a result of developments in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to repair areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normal conditions.
The circumstances now allow for the voluntary return of refugees to the country from which they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic activities affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian assistance.
Mr Al-Moualem said that the Syrian Government would be grateful for the assistance in the reconstruction of the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that supported the rebels.
The European team confirmed Ryder Cup's victory in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup in the finals of the US team against 16.5 in the Le Golf National field outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times in Europe, which has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team held the crown when its Danish Captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The American star player Phil Mickelson had trouble almost the entire tournament, and he hit the water on the 16th hole of the par-3-track, giving Francesco Molinar a match.
Italian Molinari shined on all rounds and became one of four players, who has won 5-0-0 since the tournament started in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth came out with a score of 5+4 against the lowest-ranked player of the European team, the Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, who was the world’s top player, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter, who could now play his last Ryder Cup.
The eight Ryder Cup golf vets, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most successful European in all time with a total of 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to win this victory.
It is about the team and I am glad that I could help," said Garcia, who moved after the victory of the European team.
He transfers the torch to his countryman Jon Rahm, who won the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 at the individual competitions on Sunday.
"I know a great pride after I won Tiger Woods, and I grew up to admire him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now he has Ryder Cup record 13-21-3.
Strange statistics from one of the best players of all time who's won 14 big wins and only left for Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had difficulties finding routes throughout the weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, whose game was high - quality throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the United States team said his troops failed after the performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
We printed the European team at the games this morning.
We got him.
Honor Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We regroup, work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we move on.
These 12 guys are great, and I'm proud to be their captain.
I gotta get my hat up.
We met our winner."
