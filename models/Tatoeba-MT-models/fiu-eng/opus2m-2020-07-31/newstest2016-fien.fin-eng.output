Found a 9-year-old boy on the run in Tampere.
The police have been on a search mission for a 9-year-old boy's runaway in Tampere on Tuesday night.
The missing report on a boy who left the West Tampere with his friend has spread to social media.
According to the police station, the boy has been contacted, and he has no risk of life and health.
The boy's father told Ilta-Sanom half-night, knowing he's been found.
He's fine, and now we're gonna start the post-surveillance.
The boy was found in the neighborhood of the home, and Dad told me.
Ronaldo again wild - rips the paint difference to Mess
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish League during the weekend and continued his factory in the Master League.
The fight between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo against the Masters League’s goal king turned for at least a moment in favour of the latter.
Real Madrid Ronaldo moved alone to the top of all-time goalmaker statistics when he shot a visitor on the Shahtar Donetski network two hits on the penalty kicks and one on the gambling situation.
Ronaldo raised his goal balance to 80 when before Tuesday, the Barcelona Messiah, reading with him, had a total of 77 hits.
Real won a 4-0 match.
Juventus has been compulsive in the Italian football league in Serie A since the early days, but in the Master League's division D, it started with a strong 2-1 guest victory from Manchester City.
The victory goal was made over ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The attack on the city bore the absence of a kneeling Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the Valioli game of the weekend, only came to the field in the last ten minutes.
Manchester’s second association United also had a hard time in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after suffering 1-2-kill.
Luke Shaw, a 20-year-old ManU, had only a quarter of an hour to fight.
The dangerous-looking slip coat of the PSV Hector Moreno hit the target of the attacked ManU package so badly that Shaw was likely to break his leg.
Shaw lay at Eindhoven’s home stadium for ten minutes before the medical staff left to take him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests to the 1-0 line on the 41st minute, but the joy of ManU lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno evened before the break in time.
In the second half of the year, Luciano Narsingh was the winner of the PSV.
In the Master League of the Painting season, A-block Paris Saint-Germain began.
It was the Argentinan Angel Di Maria, who had been replaced by the PSG of Manchester United's shirt.
Di Maria broke through the right and picked up Johan Wiland, Malmo’s goaltender, past the back corner of the ball.
Edinson Cavani made PSG 2-0 for the second half.
PSG's been bets on the successes of the season.
It is not a false assumption, but Malmö, one of the league's small euro, is not the best benchmark.
For the first time, the PSG star winner Zlatan Ibrahimovic met with his professional career starter Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmo in 1999.
Roman Ermenko played 90 minutes when his team lost 0-1 to Wolfsburg in the B-block match.
The opposition party immediately called for a break-up - the president gave the wrong speech
Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, has once again given the same speech he gave at the end of last month in Parliament.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently didn't realize the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether Mugabe, 91 years old, was fully alive.
The MDC of the main opposition called on Mugabe to resign because this is too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants rushed to say that the confusion had only taken place in Mugabe's staff and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mr Mugabe's speech discussed the impact of China on the country's economy earlier and now.
Germany and Austria want an extraordinary summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an extraordinary summit of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council leading the summits, will assess the request.
According to the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to better register for Europe.
The negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are, according to Merkel, part of the Minister of Interior's table.
The teacher admits he shot his girlfriend during an emergency call.
The voice of a little colored university teacher, Shannon Lamb, during the emergency call, tells the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the police have to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "gold dog" was alive and probably shocked, and said that the contact details of the loved ones of the dead woman were found on this phone.
The police inside the house found a message written on Amy Prentiss's body and green page: "I'm so sorry I wish I could cancel this love Amy and she's the only woman who's ever loved me," said a letter from experts who says Lamb is signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses at the Delta State University in Cleveland, Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers to the school campus where the police believe that he shot and killed a history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this office.
Lynn Buford, Head of Police at Delta State University, told the university staff about the shooting at 10:18 p.m.
He said Lamb called a fatal emergency call for a while after that.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths rose one more: Lamb committed suicide while the police surrounded the mother.
The authorities still tried to figure out Lamb’s motive for the day after the pupils and staff had to hide behind locked doors because of the shooting at school.
Researchers on both sides of the state have published information that shows that students and staff described Lamb as a talented teacher, but who may have had problems.
The students told me they were waiting for his class.
The Gautier police say that the Lamb had no history of violence or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book that he wrote, in which he thanked the "potential people" with whom he shared the academic life.
Both taught at the Institute of Social Sciences and History, which includes a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students attended the courses of both men.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
The student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but said that he also seemed nervous and restless, "as if something had been wrong."
Another student Mikel Sykes said Lamb told me that he was under a lot of stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
She had previously asked for a sick leave from Delta State University, saying that she had some kind of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in university pay principles meant that although Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not give him automatic career development and the post of assistant professor.
The university's principal William LaForge said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "there was clearly something in Lamb's mind".
These are the questions Lamb is no longer able to answer.
After the Lamb escaped campus, the police tracked him back to Mississippi from Arkansas state.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a 38-calibre pistol in the backyard of a house about one and a half miles south of his parents' house in the suburbs of Mississippi Greenville, says Methel Johnson, Washington County's district's death attorney.
The Lamb's car was still on the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this very house, even though Johnson said that he believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started his work at the University in 2009 and taught road and educational sciences. The university has 3,500 students and is located in a city with approximately 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb completed his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb’s old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic, and fun.
Carla Hairston told me she was 15 years old and Lamb was 20 years old when they met through friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a fun, older guy who spent many years trying to teach Hairston to play guitar.
He was quite a charm in those days.
All the girls were melted wax while he was there, now told 40-year-old Hairston who lives in the Jackson suburbs in Brandon.
Well, apparently, Lamb and Prentiss had been dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb told me he killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them at the riverside brick house in Gautier.
The police told me the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen told me they broke up 15 years ago, but he was still friends, and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really upset," O'Steen described his daughter.
She was his mother's best friend.
O'Steen told me that he had not met Lamb, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that she was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both performing on the summer market three years ago.
Later on, they called together at some gigs.
O'Steen told me that his daughter makes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different online companies.
The bartender and periodic entertainment director Mike Shaffer of the dazzling bar near Gautier says that he saw Lamb and Prentiss last on the 5th of September, after he had finished his guitar and lipstick performance to a few audiences.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were fucking around and we were fucking with each other.
So they were both pretty clever.
The deceased teacher Schmidt led a first-year student seminar program and was specializing in Indians and colonial history, told the school's English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and had three small children.
He studied at the Emporium State University of Kansas and was chairman of his fraternity and student government.
On Tuesday night, in Cleveland, the Delta State campus, a candle charter was held involving some 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students and community members.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the exhibition during which the University Choir sang the songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The teaching continues on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis are reporting on Mississippi Cleveland.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagner Cheats of Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana New Orleans participated in the report.
The case has been corrected according to the fact that the police are now saying that Lamb called the emergency call since Schmidt was shot, and that even though during the call I referred to his wife to Prentiss, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us says that it does not employ as many employees as last year, but the dealer of toys and baby products says that today's regular and seasonal workers are given the opportunity to spend more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40 000 people to work in shops and distribution centres across the country, while the number of employees in the 2014 holiday season was 45 000.
Most jobs are part-time.
The company said that interviews of applicants will begin this month, and the number of employees will rise from October to December.
Although there are months of holiday time, the Christmas season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help with the occupation of stores and sales, dispatch and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "date" with Princess Diana.
The first night of the film Return to the Future was a professionally huge moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royal arrival, and I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's place was next to me," said the future documentary film Back in Time in the trailer.
The movie starts and it reminds me that I'm just a fake trick and a hand stretched away from a date with Princess Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary on Return to the Future, which was interviewed by Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and CEO Steven Spielberg.
The return to the future got its first night 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It is certainly the greatest time travel movie of all time."
Back in Time is available in order video, DVD and in some cinemas in October.
UN leader says that the situation in Syria will not be resolved by armed means
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is that this almost five-year conflict is not going to be resolved "weapons", and more weapons will only exacerbate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN leader once again called on all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unite and support non-discriminatory negotiations in order to find a political solution.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Ban told us that he was going to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent Member States - the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain and France - at the General Assembly's Ministerial Week later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted the fact that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and the regional forces 'has made it impossible to resolve the situation.'
Ban called on the five permanent Member States to demonstrate the solidarity and consensus they showed when they agreed on Iran's nuclear programme when dealing with the Syrian crisis.
8 support polls that show Donald Trump is serious
Some people have been trying to label her as a windmill.
Some people think he's just a joke.
Some of them are waiting for the crash.
While some Republicans have tried to slow Donald Trump away from the top of the support polls, it has not (below) succeeded.
Of the last 11 national surveys in 10 Donald Trump has been in charge in the two-digit period, some have begun to think seriously about what this means in terms of the real estate potential.
Of course, the election is only in the early stages.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to become a Republican candidate.
The commentators point out that, at this stage in 2011, Rick Perry was losing its leading position in Herman Cain, of which neither of them received any State in the designation process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in public elections.
However, external groups, such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Organisation Club for Growth, have noted Trump's tenacity and have begun to use its funds to bring him down.
The following recent statements of support suggest that the real estate king is not just a passing phase:
Trump's popularity figures have made a full translation.
Just before Donald Trump announced his nomination in mid-June, the support surveys at Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans welcomed the real estate king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40%.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
At present, six out of ten Republicans welcome Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they are negative.
These figures are also true in the first pre-election states.
In a support survey conducted by the University of Quinni Market in Iowa last week, 60% of the Republicans told us they welcomed Trump.
Two thirds of the Republican voters would be pleased if Trump became a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week 67% of Republicans said that they would either be "inspired" or "satisfied" if Trump were a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they would be "suffered" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates almost the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% of "inspired" vs. Trump's 40%).
Next, the most inspiring?
Marco Rubio's only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters would be "unsatisfied" or "sufficient" if Jeb Bush, who is popular with the authorities, became a candidate.
The fiery nature of Trump is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trump has been widely criticised for his powerful speeches and insults, Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll shows that 52% of the voters on the Republican side at national level think that the real estate king has the right quality for the President.
According to last week's survey on the Quinni market, the Iowa State, which is organising the first party meeting, has the same number: 52% of the Republicans think Trump has the right quality for the leader.
However, according to ABC/Post's questionnaire 44% think that his character is not suitable for the president, and almost six out of ten think that his character is not part of the White House.
Republican voters are accustomed to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is a real option.
According to the CNN/ORC survey, four out of ten considered Trump to be the most likely alternative to asking who is most likely to be nominated as Republican candidates.
At the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Release of information: The Republican Party voters have not always had the brightest possible crystal ball available.
During the last parliamentary term, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would be appointed candidate, and only 28 per cent supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any event, this shows that the majority of the Republican voters believe that Trump's campaign is credible.
Even if the Republicans were to support another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that a flat field is likely to have contributed to Trump’s leadership, as anti-trump’s support is divided between a number of other candidates.
However, the survey carried out by Monmouth University at the beginning of September showed that in the hypothetical bilateral competition between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump receives a majority of support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasch and Chris Christie with 33 points.
He's in touch with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to win Trump?
If they were set up opposites, Ben Carson would win the businessman Trump with a big 18-point difference.
It is precisely that the majority of Donald Trump's supporters have said that they have made a decision.
The new CBS/NYT survey from Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of Trump's profitable voters have decided who their vote will go.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can say for sure that they will never change their minds.
46% said they might be able to change candidates.
In any case, Trump's biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they've made a decision are twice as likely to be on Trump's side.
Six out of ten Republicans say that they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapeers" in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been at the centre of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump’s mightiness will drive Latin voters further away from the Republican Party and harm rebranding companies.
According to the new ABC/Post survey published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans claim to agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the centre of things, so is Donald Trump.
The desolation of the government has reached a new peak.
The support of Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of the Republican voters, largely due to their position outside politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said in the ABC/Post survey on Monday that they prefer to choose a non-political person rather than one with a government experience.
They're also mad at the federal government.
The two weeks ago Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey from Iowa showed that three of the four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with the Republican Congress: 54% are "unsatisfied" and 21% are "really angry".
Jeremy Corbyn's first appearance at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first appearance in Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election.
For the first time in the Prime Minister's Question Time, Jeremy Corby, the new director of the Labour Labour Party, will meet David Cameron.
Corby raises to ask about his first six questions shortly after noon, and probably both the media and the Labour Party's representatives were watching his performance closely.
Corby's been calling for this week's show "less theater and more facts".
He has also said that he could leave part of the opportunities for his fellow Members to take care of.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Corbyn's leadership after being appointed to the shadow government and spoke at the annual meeting of the Confederation of Trade Unions on Tuesday.
At the same time, the Labour Party Director’s decision to stand still during the National Song in the Memorial service of Tuesday, which was held on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the British Air War, has raised criticism of the Conservative Party’s representatives and has appeared on several front page cases.
Corbyn's decision not to sing a song has attracted attention
Corbyn's representative said he was "respectably standing" and he said "recognition of the bravery of the Royal Air Forces in the Great Britain's Air War."
Mr Smith, member of Corbyn's shadow government, said to the BBC Two Newsnight program that he would have asked the Labour Party Director to sing a national song, despite his view that the Royal House should be terminated.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to be involved in Corbyn's inner circle, calling for differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs, initially supported by less than one sixth of Parliament's party.
BBC Policy Correspondent Robin Brant says that the differences in orientations regarding the role of the party in the European Union and the Government's ceiling on aid have also been "exploited" within the Labour Party since Corbyn was appointed.
At the meeting of the Confederation of Trade Unions, Corbyn said that the Labour Party is proposing a change that would remove the entire roof.
An hour later, Mr Smith, Secretary for Labour and Pensions of the Shadow Government, said that the party was "very clear" in that they were only opposed to the government's plans to count the ceiling from £26 000 to £230,000.
Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Labour Party met by David Cameron during the last decade, when he was the leader of the Conservative Party.
The president of the Labour Party has promised a new approach to politics, and now tells us that he has "grouped" ideas for questions to the Prime Minister and has received more than 30 000 proposals.
The Islington North MP, Corbyn, has said that the nature of the Prime Minister's Question Time is too controversial and that he intends to refrain from both clever words and clicks, allowing him instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the Financial Secretary of the shadow government, will act as her substitute for her at Question Time when Corby is not participating - for example when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corby has also proposed that other colleagues should be allowed to speak at some point and he has said that he has approached the President of the House, Mr Bercowi, from the point of view of the matter.
When Cameron took the lead in 2005, he said that he wanted to move further away from a political theatre that is often linked to the Prime Minister's Question Time, but he later had to admit that he had failed.
Since the start of television in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important indicator of the leadership's discretion, the control of his lower room, as well as his position with other representatives, although critics have criticised Question Times for the fact that they have only become a gloomy image requiring far-reaching reforms.
Imaged in Joburg: Homeless young people are trained as photographers
The center of Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and make a living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is an unprofitable studio where homeless young people are taught how to take photographs of their neighbourhood and gain from it.
BBC News met one of the first young people who had completed the project.

The value of the weight increases as the UK's wage growth accelerates
The value of the weight jumped upwards after the figures showed an increase in the UK wage growth and at the same time the FTSE 100 index rose with SABMiller.
Between May and July, British wages, other than bonuses, rose by 2.9 per cent from the same time last year.
The rate of growth was the fastest after 2009 and was considered to bring estimates of an increase in the exchange rates.
The weight rose over one per cent against a dollar of 1.5505 and 0.84 per cent against EUR 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49 per cent to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinct share on the market and increased by 20 % after the competitor AB InBev approached it with the offer.
The agreement would combine the two largest brewery in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 per cent after the encouraging news from the competing luxury group, Richmont.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China, which is the key market for Burberry, had begun to grow again.
Glencore’s shares rose 5 percent after the mine left told us that it had raised $2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt surgery strategy.
The Mond's shares in the packaging and paper group were the largest in the index, 4.3 per cent after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation from company to "sale".
JD Sports rose by 3.1 per cent after the sports clothing company released half a year before tax: 83 per cent to GBP 46.6 million.
According to JD Sports Director, higher wages can damage enlargement
Peter Cowgill, director of JD Sports, says that if workers are increased minimum wage in Great Britain, it may mean "the purchasing power of potential consumers will increase".
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs for the company, Cowgill notes.
The costs could be linked to the company's enlargement plans, he added, which would mean less more jobs.
Metcash is launching a grass-rooted campaign against Ald's intruder.
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA business from Ald's attack on South and West Australia.
Metcash, the wholesaler of food, has launched a grass-rooted campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in South and West Australia before Aldin's $700 million attack.
At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food intermediaries and build IGA brands through the marketing of mainstream and social media and through events such as the Adelaide show.
The traders and buyers of IGA have jumped in, and brands like Simmo's, an ice cream manufacturer from Dunsborough, offer tasteful IGA shops, and shop owners sell discount tickets to Australian football matches to their regular customers.
Metcashin is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on 29 September, when this wholesaler of food, alcohol and iron goods organises the annual investor strategy date.
There is a great deal of money in the game, since South and Western Australia account for almost 30 % of Metcash's IGA trade area in total, and yield margins are higher than in the IGA network in the Eastern States of Metcash.
In South and West Australia, shoppers are known to be in the corner, and IGA dealers have a much higher market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30 % in the south and 24 % in the west compared to 14 % in the east.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi will capture around 5 % of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of the first movements.
In his report this week, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA dealers could lose $360 million annually in sales and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year, Aldi will open up 25 movements in the south and 30 in the west, resulting in a turnover of 500 and 600 million dollars in these areas.
Loss of food and food sales and quantities at the Metcash base of high fixed costs can cost Metcash around $13 million operating losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash lost market share in the eastern states mainly to Ald and Coles, although the recent study of Roy Morgan found that IGA’s customers were the most loyal ones.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash’s food and food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016; 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018 so that its market share will fall from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent in 2020.
Last week, the manager of the investment fund and the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglas, said at business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "very likely lose in a decade".
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglas' comments.
However, it has been understood that last week a member of the Metcash Board would have contacted Douglas.
Since 2010, the market share of IGA has fallen from 18% to 14%, and revenues from Metcash’s food and food business, which delivers products to around 1200 IGA dealers, have decreased by 43% since 2012.
However, the wholesaler holds its half, and has invested over $150 million a year in the weekly fall in prices for hundreds of products to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA dealers to renovate stores by increasing the rate of fresh food and by placing a better range of private brand products on the market.
Ian Morrise, Director-General of Metcash, says that the calculation of prices and the improvement of stores have increased the attractiveness and hopes that the wholesaler will return to the path of growth in returns in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Australia's tennis union president Steve Healy supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves honor rather than criticism of his conduct
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered as a sidekick in a recent storm that has raged around his friend Nick Kyrgyos. He deserves credit rather than criticism for his own conduct, says Steve Healy, president of the Australian Tennis Union.
The younger member of the gifted twin, called "special Ks" Kokkinakis, was unwittingly exposed to a case in which Kyrgyos provoked Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters competition.
Soon thereafter, in a fire-fighting fight in Cincinnati, the main judge had to break up twice between Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison when Harrison declared: "Wawrinkan should have beat Kyrgyos, and I should have beat that kid."
Even though Cooknakis was last seen breaking down his bat after the cramp ruined his possible victory over Richard Gasquet in the US Open, Healy has been a sturdy defender of Kokkinakis.
Right now, a young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth from another place in doubles with Bernard Tomic at Davis Cup's semifinal against Britain.
"I think rather strongly that Thanasi has just been dragged into trouble," Healy said.
He broke his bat when he lost the cramp at the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his bat when he's frustrated, and I know Thanas well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But he has behaved perfectly well, also in quite provocative situations in the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a nice family around him, and I think he's been treated a little hard.
He is very mature to be 19 years old, he works hard, fits in with the team and so on, and he has never had problems with other players. He is appreciated in the dressing room, he is practice hard, is in good condition and is quite peaceful and mature for a young man, and I think he should be judged according to his merit.
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Kyrgyo in important games starting on Friday, describing this 'common decision' as a good solution for everyone, but still supporting the Canberran return to the team's stability.
"We want the team to be fully focused on games and not on everything around [Cyrgyos]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen really quickly, as Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he's grown up in public, and he's made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he's received. However, we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think it's best for both the team and for him if he spends some time out of the audience to reflect on these consequences.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border against Serbia, with the exception of those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of blocking the flow of migrants coming to the country.
There was chaos at the border when hundreds of immigrants gathered in a neutral area, and the Serbian authorities reacted with shock.
The people who fled the violence of their own countries have now set up their tents and set on a roadside between the inspection posts in two countries for an indefinite period.
However, futility increased.
While the police helicopter remained above them, immigrants were saying "Open the border!" and screamed insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water for protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared that it is "unacceptable" for the return of migrants from Hungary when they are constantly arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, does not cause harm to civilians.
The debate will have to take place in the next few days with other countries and Brussels," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The confusion at the Hungarian-Serbia border arose after the 28th nationality grouping failed to establish a common immigration policy in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on a division of responsibilities for 40,000 people who have now taken over Italy and Greece, and Ministers hopefully spoke about reaching a final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - which EU countries will take 120 000 additional refugees, including part of Hungary.
On Tuesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for an extra EU summit to discuss the immigration crisis in the continent.
Hungary does not, however, hope that its neighbours or Brussels will work in the near future.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation in two southern regions gave the authorities greater powers to act in the crisis and enabled you to be closed and asylum cases to be speeded up.
At the same time, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, Peter Sijjarto, said that, now that the fence is complete at the Serbian border, the country will also set up its borders against Romania to stop the flood of immigrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agat reported that even prisoners had been recruited to finalise the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and arrival point for refugees in the European Union, many of whom are fleeing the war from Syria and the rest of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has claimed that most of the arrivals are looking for a better life for economic refugees, and not those who escape from the war who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly in conflict with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that entered into force at midnight in Hungary now identify a company as a crime to cross or harm a 4-metre (13 feet) barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border against Serbia and include longer prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"As a result of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government declares an emergency," the government informs the press in the south of Szeged.
We are very clear on this: crossing an illegal border is a crime.
Parliament still needs to formally accept the military deployment expected next week, but the Associated Press journalists at the border have seen heavy-armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days.
Orban’s Home Security Adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said that the authorities had captured 45 people in their efforts to cross the border, and 15 countries had already had time.
They were overrun by damage to the fence, now captured by the police, and are accused of the violations defined by the new laws.
The authorities will repair the fence quickly.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossing points from the border with Serbia after they had sent a train wagon covered by a bar wire to close one of these places.
The main border crossing point near Roszke, Hungary, was covered in chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for human handling and the crowds infiltrated.
About 20 heads inside, but thousands were left out.
A group of immigrants blocked the main motorway between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they refuse to eat and drink until they are allowed to come to Hungary.
2016 elections: According to the National Survey, Hillary Clinton’s leadership in Bernie Sanders has narrowed by half
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will continue in two-digit lead in the Democratic Nominations Competition, but Senator Bernie Sanders will hang on to him.
Clinton now supports 47% of the democratic voters (calculated by 58%), while Sanders, second, supports 27% (increased by 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will join the presidential competition, but he is supported by 15% of the democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the pre-election, most of the democratic voters say that it is still too early to say that they would have decided who to vote for.
However, Clinton’s supporters stand behind their choice more strictly than those of other candidates.
Clinton’s popularity has fallen among a number of population groups since the CBS News Poll survey last month, while Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is strongly in charge of women and moderates, but his leadership has narrowed.
His popularity among men has decreased considerably, and Sanders is only five percentage points behind.
Clinton's head start in the midst of democratic voters under the age of 50 has been lost, and he's now even with Sanders.
However, Clinton clearly leads with senior voters.
In the last month, Clinton led Sanders in the double-numbering of liberals, but now Sanders is leading this group by five percentage points.
About half of the democratic voters in the country say that they are very supportive of Clinton if he becomes a party candidate.
A fourth says he supports her with certain reservations, and 15% would support her only because she is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support him at all.
It is not very surprising that the current supporters of Clinton are very likely to be eager to support him.
Those who are currently not in favour of Clinton are more confused with their opinions. Only a quarter of them would be eager to support him.
Where 48% of the democratic voters say that they would vehemently support Clinton, the Republican First Man Donald Trump says the same thing to less than the Republican voters (35%).
When they asked Clinton’s supporters about the open question why they wanted him to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that he had the right experience (16%), and then the most popular answers were that now is the time for the female president (13%) and that he is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton’s supporters also mentioned his connection with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
As the Vice-President has an impact on the possible presidential candidate, 57% of the democratic voters would like to see him already in the competition - although one third disagrees.
When asked who they would choose for second party appointments, Biden is the most popular choice.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say they'd choose a Biden that's much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to seek the candidate of the Democrats, the lead of Hilary Clinton from Sanders will grow. If Biden goes along, the management will be 20 percentage points, but if he fails, the number will be 30.
55% of the democratic voters believe that Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
With this standard, Biden remains far away, but the proportion of those who prefer him has grown.
When asked what was most important about the candidate, however, they put their opinions above voting.
In addition, last month no democratic candidate or potential candidate was considered impossible for these voters.
Democrat candidates or potential candidates will be well suited to certain key issues among the voters of their parties.
Most people regard Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden's best at being honest with the three, while Clinton's strength is the leadership.
30 per cent of the Democrats say that they do not think Clinton is honest and reliable, which is twice as much as Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent say that they do not have an opinion on Sanders.
Democrat voters also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden agree ideologically.
As we look at all these issues, about a quarter of the Democrats say that they do not have an opinion on Sanders.
Although the personal email address of Hillary Clinton and the use of the server while he was Minister of Foreign Affairs still raise questions, the majority of the democratic voters are satisfied with his explanation of the matter and say that the matter did not affect their public opinion about him.
However, it is different when we consider America as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about one third are satisfied.
The public’s opinions were divided in March shortly after it became daylight.
Most Americans say that their overall opinion of Clinton was not influenced by the e - mail policy, although 36 percent say that their opinion of him has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten Republicans say that their opinion on Clinton has become worse.
Although Clinton's own party voters consider him honest and reliable, this is still a problem for him among all the registered voters. Only 32% consider him honest and reliable, and this figure has fallen by 8 percentage points since last month and 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say that they do not think Clinton is honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of the voters registered throughout the country do not consider Trump to be honest and reliable.
However, both Clinton and Trump are regarded as well-informed leaders.
Of the six candidates involved in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered to be the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered to be honest, but many of them have no opinion, just like Carson does.
The error margin in the study involving 351 democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump in a national inquiry.
Ben Carson is coming near Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll.
In the new survey, two candidates collected half of all the votes, leaving the others to fight for a foothold.
Throughout the country, the Republican voters are still strongly in favour of Trump, whose support has risen to 27% of the survey published by CBS on 23% of the CBS poll on Tuesday before the elections of last month's Fox News.
At the same time, however, Carson rose from 6% to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well among the various demographic groups and is evoking Trump among higher-level Republican voters.
The rest of the field has fallen behind, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Governor John Kasichi of Ohio. Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin has fallen most: from 10% last month to 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and floridan Senator Marco Rubio are on level three at 6%.
The error margin in the sample of this latest survey of September 376 Republican voters is +/- 6 per cent.
Last week's latest CNN/ORC survey published showed Carson's rise in the polls: he has 19% support for the Republicans, and Trump is ahead of him by 32%.
Also, according to the latest ABC News/Washington Post questionnaire, Trump was significantly ahead of Carson.
As Carson's popularity rose last week, Trump criticised retired neurosurgery for nothing, even though Carson apologized for the question of Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday on his campaign visit to Iowa.
Five fraternity members are charged with the death of Baruch College's first year student.
Almost two years after the student died at the Brotherhood Simputus ceremony in the Pocono Mountains region of Pennsylvania, the charge of murder has been raised against five people.
The members of the Baruch College, located in New York City, Pi Delta Psi, brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the membership contest in September 2013, and then delayed taking him to the hospital, thus contributing to his death, the police said.
The authorities say that Deng's eyes were tied and his back was loaded with a bag full of sand, and then repeatedly he was beaten to the ground when he tried to walk across the icy field towards the goal.
Finally, Deng complained that his head was hurt, after which he lost consciousness.
The members of the Brotherhood did not call the emergency number after Deng passed out, but were charged for an hour before they brought him to the hospital, the police say.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, search the network for information on his symptoms, and contact the Brotherhood's National President Andy Meng for advice, Chris Wagner, the chief of police, told me at a press conference.
"This is where the members began to hide their ritual equipment, and therefore practically put the welfare of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng," said Commissioner Wagner.
They couldn't get Deng back to work, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng received repeated attacks on the head, body and thighs of a dull object.
"There have been too many families suffering from fraternity suffrage, when at least one student has died since 1970", Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the family of Deng, said in his opinion.
Brothers and their members must be held accountable, and this is an important step for the authorities.
The grand jury in Monroe County was in favour of the first five members being charged with the murder of the third degree.
32 other members of the brotherhood, including Meng, are also charged with violent maiming and criminal plotting.
"We do not want to be held responsible only for individuals; if there is an organisation behind it that officially or informally accepted the situation, they should also be held accountable", Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood and the national brotherhood from breaking up their contacts with the local department.
This is what happens when the US central bank increases interest rates
Interest rate increases will come and the markets for rising courses will fall, bond yields will rise and the economy will decline.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it takes or how long it takes.
The past does not provide much help in terms of timing, especially in relation to the economy.
The recovery has taken only 11 months since the first lifting, and sometimes it has been as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the US Central Bank in raising interest rates has often, although not always, been a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
That is why US Central Bank officials have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on it because interest rates are being raised, but mainly in the development cycle of the time for normalisation.
Indeed, there are several variables in the equation.
However, in the end, market participants will be able to see that all interest-bearing subsidies have been oversized.
"The first increase following the global economic crisis in the central bank is inevitably interpreted as the end of the period of 'hot money' in some circles," said Capital Economics, chief economic expert Julian Jessop in a message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return of interest rates in the United States to the normal, although still low, level of shock that many seem to be afraid of.
However, this does not mean that it has no effect.
Here is an overview of how some economic sectors will react on the basis of past developments:
As has been seen on the market in the last six months, waiting to raise interest can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite as dramatic.
"It seems that the return on capital tends to stop for 12-24 months after the first increase, which may reflect a delay in monetary policy", Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study about what will happen after the increase of the central bank.
More specifically, during the last 35 years, the market is generally strong, with an increase of around 14%, 250 days after the increase, and the average increase of 2.6% has been achieved after 500 days, with an average return of 14.4% in the last six cycles, according to the recent analysis of the leading capital strategy of Nuveen Asset Management, Bob Doll, published in the Barron's magazine.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on the shares is generally clearer at the later stage of the raising cycle when the proceeds start to fall.
Guarantees are part of the economy, but interest payments often contribute to their arrival.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges that have not previously been faced and which can speed up the recession.
This is in particular a gross domestic product, which will be closest to the lowest level of all time before the central bank buys interest.
According to Deutsche Bank, the annual nominal GDP of the 118 increase since 1950 has only been less than twice as high as 4.5%.
Although in the second quarter of 2015, the figure was 3.6 per cent, few people believe that it will last after the third quarter has gone by 1.5 per cent, says Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.
The rise in interest rates in this fragile economic situation may be risky and raise the question of whether this is a different one,” Deutsche Bank said.
The market participants have been preparing to increase the central bank all year round, and everyone is expecting this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which will end on Thursday.
While many strategies and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept an increase in this meeting, futures trading only anticipates a 25% probability.
"Our research shows that since 1950, all growth cycles have so far experienced an increasing leverage effect in super-cycles where GDP has passed its pre-return peak very quickly after recovery has started," the report says.
On the other hand, there has been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst in the observation period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has been waiting overwhelmingly for the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and now it is 74 months.
The flat-rate return has also been unstable while the market is awaiting an increase in interest rates, and the model is somewhat similar to the findings made on capital.
The main difference is that, when the central bank changes its lines, its effects will be seen more quickly in debt certificates than in shares.
The trend of the bond yields appears to change immediately in the case of the first cycle increase/surgery.
At the end of the increase cycle, the return on bonds will be immediately reduced", Deutche Bank said.
Charles Schwab’s strategies believe that the interest rate increase will bring about a convergence of the yields of longer and shorter-term debt securities, thus levelling the yield curve.
High-income bonds often produce better in such a situation, although "we are still careful about looking for profit", says Schwab's fixed income analyst Kathy Jones in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank's expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the fall in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospects of a tighter monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is more stable, the credit margins have increased and the instability has increased - all these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened up its policies.
Generally speaking, companies whose business is mainly based in the United States win when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies, which owe a lot of money, do worse when the increase in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than they have funding.
"Historia shows that 'quality' shares are generally more profitable in the three months after the first raise", Goldman Sachs' analysts stated in their customer report.
Companies with strong net sales overrun weak turnover companies after increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with a high return on capital and low volatility shares were better off than low-quality companies, with an average of 4 (percentage) and 3 (percentage) of the latter.
The debt will be a big problem.
Those companies with a lot of variable interest rates are losing the most, Goldman said.
In addition to stock exchange speculation, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from an increase in the value of the dollar.
Savings can also benefit from higher returns, although the experts disagree on how quickly the impact feels.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, says Congressman Andrew Bingham
Conservative High Representative Andrew Bingham blames the channel for "nationalization"
He claims that it becomes more and more difficult to separate it from a commercial competitor.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying that they only imitate the British Awards.
Mr Collins, Member of the Parliament, criticised The Voice, saying that it was not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is becoming "classic FM", claims the leading representative, adding the pressure of the production company to prove that it does something that commercial production companies do not.
The Conservatives, Andrew Bingham, also said to the BBC leaders that the public service radio channel seemed to have a "successful" content, and that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish it from a commercial competitor.
"It seems that Radio 3 - I don't want to use the term "nationalize" - is becoming a classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards Awards, which was launched last December.
"The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, seem to be a British Awards gala organised under different names.
So if you're trying to do something different, here are two examples I remember directly when you actually just copied something that you already found on the market," Bingham said.
The Director General of the BBC challenged the accusations that BBC Radio 3 is much ahead of his commercial partner as regards live music and the sharing of information to the public.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I can't learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is, in fact, first-class.
"In addition, I think it is really important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works," he said.
Earlier this year, the head of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel must work more than previously to reach the public because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's offer, which was criticised for entering commercial competitors' toes during the consultation of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
The Conservative Tory MP Damien Collins criticised The Voice, a music competition purchased by BBC from the Dutch production company Talpa Media, estimated at £22 million.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and it is in no way unique?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 channel program, in which Paloma Faith and Boy George are the star judges, was produced "in the very style of BBC".
He added that he wanted the production company "to find success inside his own house" the next time he started a series of entertainments.
However, he did not consent to the production of future The Voice periods, or to the imposition of other entertainment formats for the money of the promising.
Net sales have increased least so far in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Net sales increased by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
Last month was the lowest year since the start of statistics in 2000
Three years ago online sales confirmed the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts believe that November Black Friday might slow down consumption
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has grown enormously and has transformed many of Britain’s shopping streets into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs of a level playing field in the air when the latest figures showed only a 7 % increase in the first quarter of 2015.
Total consumption in August grew least since the start of statistics in 2000: only five per cent increase from last year.
Experts say that there are signs of a levelling of online sales in the air, when the latest figures showed only a 7 % increase in the first quarter of 2015.
"If we look at the growth levels of previous years and return to 2000, it was clear that the situation would be rationalized over time," Andy Mulcahy, a journalist of the JMRG sales index, told Guardian.
He explained that three years ago online sales increased when buyers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that more people made purchases online, and that they could be made in different environments, such as the couch.
But now it balances, and (growth) can be calculated.
The Black Friday phenomenon from America has been considered one of the causes of slowing down shops.
Experts believe that consumers will control shopping before the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times as much as usual, buyers flocked to their computers to catch shops, pouring over the websites of many traders.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which caused buyers to argue about the findings, can slow down shopping.
A study published by the British Retail consortium found that only about one in five were used online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are now made online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes from the network instead of using fashion chains from shopping companies.
Muslims bury Mecca in a crane accident, the family of Bin Laden, who died.
The Muslims carried 29 dead bodies across the streets during the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has been partly accused of a collapse by the leftover Saudi Binlad Group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured when the crane collapsed.
29 dead men were carried across the streets, and hundreds of Muslims gathered together to bury them. The victims died when the crane fell in Mecca's great masseuse.
Mostly the white-dressed mourners filled the path to honor the first of the dead, who made their final journey to the cemetery of Al-Moaissem.
The sad procession passed a sacred place, where only a few days ago the crane fell through the roof of the mosque and poured down worshipers.
The bodies were released for burial when the king of Saudi Arabia confirmed that the building group of the Bin Laden family was guilty of a disaster involving 394 people.
The bodies of 29 of those who were killed by cranes in the Mecca’s great mosque were carried across the streets
Among the dead were the father of four children from Qasim Akram Bolton, Manchester, who was in his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Akram had been in a great mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual journey of hair-sacrifice.
The Saudi authorities have already sworn that the waste of Mecca will continue as thousands continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Binlad Group should not have left up the crane when it was not in use.
The Arabic version of the decision published by the State-led Saudi Press Agency stated that the Binladin Group is partly responsible for the collapse.
The news agency’s service in English did not mention this detail, but it stated that the company’s managers are prohibited from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week Salman swore that he would survive the fall of cranes in the yard of the great mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered before the hair-sacrifice that was held later this month.
The Binladin Group has not published any communications on the collapse of the deaf, and its representatives have not been caught for comment.
The royal decision also accused the community of not using up-to-date safeguards and did not cooperate with meteorological authorities.
There are tens of cranes around the Mecca factory, which are part of the huge robbery led by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to the Saudi family for decades, leading to major construction projects.
Al-Qaida's late leader Osama bin Laden was a rebel son whose family denied it in the 1990s.
The collapse took place in windy and rainy weather only days before millions arrive in the kingdom for pilgrimage, which every capable Muslim should be made at least once in his life.
Authorities say 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities ordered a million ryals (174,000 pounds) to be paid to the families of the dead and to those who were permanently injured.
The rest of the injured will receive half of this amount.
B&Q boss says that Eastern Europeans working cheaply are behind popularity
The British are using more and more helpers' favors, Veronique Laury says.
The number of professionals from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a result of sales to professionals in the Screwfix business, 200 more will be opened
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q shops all over the country
Writer Rupert Steiner, the city’s chief correspondent for Daily Mail
The British are said to give up hammers and paint chips and rather hire skilled Eastern European workers to do home repairs.
It seems that if you're with a hammer or you start painting walls, you're in a minority now.
You see, the British are employing more and more helpers to do their own work in their homes, says the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new president of Kingfisher, who owns the home repair chain, said that behind popularity is the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at a blatant price.
This leads to Kingfisher planning to open up 200 new sales of Screwfix for workers and close down 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said that she wanted more women to work at B&Q stores, because eight out of ten shopping decisions are specifically made by a more beautiful sex.
Today most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: today there are more single women's economies that do more home repairs than before.
Laury said, "The biggest part of our sales personnel is still men.
We need to get a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of product purchases are made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of only five women who run the main attempts of the British FTSE100 index, and he has restructured his management team so that there are as many men and women in it.
Kingfisher is almost the only company with 50 % of women in the group, including its CEO and financial director.
Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important matter here.
It hasn't been hard to find good women in the management team."
Kingfisher reported a fall in both the six months’ output and sales after the Group took the cost of closing down the shops.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, who owns the Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new stores
The three aces government decided to resort to coercive legislation in order to save the country's economy.
The apparent effects were achieved quite quickly.
The sharp head of the SAK and other employees' centres began to be forced immediately and as a result the country stands on Friday due to the widespread expression of employees.
Quite a bit of people think there's a reason at that point.
Let's ask if it's worth a strike when it's bad.
Even a resistance movement has been established.
More than 50,000 people on the Internet have already reported that they are not going to participate in the demonstration, but are going to work.
In the old days of good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet where to protest, but openly declaring a rich person would have been a political suicide.
Millions of professional organisations are not much affected by the protest of a few tens of thousands, but it gives rise to thinking.
The status of the trade union movement is no longer as clear as it was a couple of decades ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed
From the point of view of the interest of Ay business, the government's rough solutions can also be seen as a direct heavenly gift.
After years of looking like things are rolling on their own, the alliances finally get to the point, namely workers' rights to defend, visibly and properly.
In this way, the Government may want to enlist the role of the Ay movement when membership in the trade union is perhaps seen as more necessary than before.
Whatever the organisation's action, it's stupid that Friday's expression of mind would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial output has been falling for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product is still falling and unemployment is rising.
These things would make everyone's head come to terms.
Hard savings for Lappeenranta University: Objective 8.5 million savings, staff reduction by 130
The technical university of Lappeenranta will start with a savings envelope with the aim of reducing costs by a total of EUR 8,5 million.
As part of savings, the University starts negotiations on the whole staff, with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, this means reducing around 130 workers.
In addition, two million other activities will be saved.
The outcome of the YT negotiations is the 2016 budget, which anticipates a deficit of 8.5 million.
It is also affected by government cuts in appropriations.
During this financial year, the University will produce approximately 2.6 million deficits.
Costs will increase slightly next year, but funding from the Ministry will fall by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The university's total budget is around EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive cuts in teaching and research and the reduction in company funding on our university is very important, says Principal Anneli Pauli in the University's press release.
Before summer, the effects of surgery seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in additional funding appears to be in new proportions.
Negotiations with trustees will be launched next week on Tuesday and will last for six weeks as prescribed by the law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finland's railways
The owner of Onnibus, the British company Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company is also targeting rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in taking part in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of Britain's largest railway companies, Souter says.
Rail traffic is expected to be gradually opened up to competition.
The first is close transport in the capital region in 2017-2018.
There will be long-distance traffic after close-moving.
Souter says he's already approached the Ministry of Transport.
In the Ministry of Transport, Yle says that the plans for Onnibus are welcomed.
Other international companies have expressed their interest in rail transport, at least Transdev (former Veolia), which also has bus and rail transport in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
The U.S. Central Bank must decide on interest rates
The rest of the world will follow the meeting of the U.S. Central Bank on Wednesdays and Thursdays to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time to almost a decade.
When Reuters asked 80 economists about just over half of those who believed last week that the central bank would raise interest rates, they now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and the interest rates will be kept at the current level of 0-0.25%.
This is a historic event, because when the central bank cut interest rates to zero, it will be seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank has the opportunity to leave the zero level and start normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Peterson Institute for International Economics, senior senior senior.
The U.S. economy has worked relatively well, and the recovery has brought billions of dollars into the balance sheet and little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the less rose global outlook.
It has warned the market that they must be ready to take up, but the signs also show that they believe that probability is opposed to increase.
The decision will be published on Thursday at 20 a.m. (CET).
The shooter at Delta State University left an apology message
After his girlfriend was shot in Mississippi on Monday morning, before he shot his colleagues later that day, Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying he was "bad" about the first murder and hoped "you could cancel it", the authorities told me on Tuesday.
The Mississippi Gautier Police told me that the headmaster of the Delta State University's geographical and social sciences Lamb called the emergency number about 10 in the morning.
Monday, he told me he shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the answering machine that the police had to send officers to his house.
He said "killed his wife last night" and also mentioned that there was a "sult dog" in the house, which "don't bother anyone", but it's probably shocked.
The police asked the caller this name, but he didn't say it.
The Lamb didn't explain the shooting.
When the police got there, there was the body of an 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a 45-year-old Lamb hand-written message that said, "I'm so sorry I wish I could cancel it.
I loved Amy, and she was the only person who ever loved me."
After writing a message, Lamb drove nearly 500 kilometers to Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt before he finally killed himself late on Monday when the police surrounded him.
The university's principal William LaForge said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "there was clearly something in Lamb's mind".
On Tuesday, the authorities said that, despite the arguments published on Monday that the Lamb believed that Prentiss had been in a relationship with Schmidt, there was no "knowledge or evidence of the loan" of any kind of "three-way".
Shawn O'Steen said he and Prentis were married for about seven years and described him as a good man.
A couple of years ago, she broke up, but she stayed friends.
O'Steen told me that she and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who's "suffered".
O'Steen told me that Prentiss and her daughters were "one of the best friends of all time".
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked on the Internet from her home. Sun Herald said that Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
The police said that Lamb called his relatives somewhere on Monday to tell them that "he's not going to jail."
When the police reached the Lamb Highway 1 near Greenville that night, Lamb stopped his car on the side of the road, left it in it, and went running into the forest where he shot himself.
Lamb argued about education at Delta State in spring 2015, says the University’s website’s CV.
Stars that lost their charm
The actor (left), in a picture with his son Redmond (right), has been hard in recent years.
In 2001 he was ill with leukaemia and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
Rumors have also reported that he has had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this, indeed, requires its own tax.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is out for months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw had a double break in his right leg when Manchester United lost to PSV Eindhoven in the Champion League match.
Although the defenseman remained in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw could still play this season.
The injury was caused by the reckless attack by Héctor Moreno at 15 minutes after Shaw, 20 years old, had crashed into the PSV area.
He was treated for nine minutes in the field and had to be given oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture on his leg and now he's in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after that, and then he'll be cut in Manchester.
The boy comes to Manchester United when he's 18, suffers from trouble and then plays great, and this is what happens.
When I was in the dressing room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture takes at least six months, and he's not playing in the block.
I hope he gets to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he got a red card and a sentence shot.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that an Italian agent was wrong.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-legged fight.
Shaw went on to say, "Thank you for all your messages, the words aren't enough to tell you how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I come back stronger."
Subject: Manchester United suffers from Luke Shaw and disappears from PSV
The English defenseman has an additional incentive to recover next June’s European Championships in France.
The P.S.V. Coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a really bad injury."
If a player gets out because of this kind of injury, everyone is very sad.
Our players are never meant to offend the opponent.
Moreno's leg broke when he played against Van Gali in the Mexican team against the Netherlands in the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno takes this hard because the aim is not to hurt the opponent, and when he hears that the injury is really bad, it's bad," Cocu said.
I didn't see you in that situation.
The only thing I saw was a ball going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] touched it, but I didn't see Luke fighting.
Moreno said to SBS6: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel terrible about this. I'm so sorry."
Andrés Guardado of the PSV was also taken to the hospital after Chris Modelang challenged him.
David Cameron knows Lorax better than this, right?
Each parent will soon learn one thing: If your child loves a book, it won’t take long to learn it almost outside.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When the holiday childcare service asked the Prime Minister about his favorite children's book, he chose Dr. Seussin's Lorax, a environmental-protection story published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes in a message published on the SuperCamps website and goes on to say, "A funny, moving, creative, and contains a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children because it always seems to have a picture or message that we have never seen before."
All this is true, but the next paragraph, where Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book, is a summary of the 2012 film version, where new characters and details had been added to complete a rather short original text.
"In the town of Tarville, inside the walls, where all nature is lost and even air is a commodity, Ted hopes to overcome his dreams to the heart of the girl by fulfilling Audrey's desire to see the right tree", the text says and describes the love story that Dr. Seuss, who died in 1991, did not write from the right name Theodor Seuss Geisel.
If this is not suspicious enough, Cameron's text sounds like it was taken from the plot of the Lorax film found on the Internet Movie Database, starting with the following: "In the town of Tarville inside the walls, where everything is artificial and even air is a commodity, Ted hopes to win his dreams to the heart of Audrey."
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so inexplicable to the book's plot. In it, a young, anonymous boy hears how the local nature has destroyed greed, wood-smearing, and needs-smearing Kerskanen, without caring for the story of the short, whiny creature that named Lorax, which is "smears for trees".
Such a relatively invisible PR task is probably excluded from an assistant who apparently never read the book 20 times in a row for a child.
The Prime Minister's informant said that the text might have come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was obtained from Cameron's staff, but did not comment further at that point.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being left behind by the English team, but it was still a tough place.
Playing against Pakistan in the Arab Emirates is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for the tour, I don't think it's likely that the last time we lost 3-0 series will happen again.
I wouldn't even close the guest profit off the bill.
Alastair Cook may be less experienced than a three-year-old team, but it involves good spinners and team thinking is strong: they have no scars from 2012, only youthful positives.
Fashion Ali develops in its rotational feeds and Adil Rashid is an assailant option, although there is an unknown factor at this level.
Subject: Adam Lyth dropped from the British Cricket Team, replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth on the team is understandablely difficult to analyze for me because I am his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against the attackers in challenging circumstances, and the simple but beary truth is that the critics are criticised on the basis of their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root's choice before the press release, because, as I said before, players are the best selection factors.
About a hundred points more, and Lyth's season in the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own fate.
I hope he gets more runs for Yorkshire, another chance comes up.
Even when she did not do as well as she could, and it does not surprise me. Lyth is first and foremost a team player.
It's hard to answer the question of how long it takes a hitter to leave a trail.
Lyth was elected seven times to the national team, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton got the chance to play both at home and at the guests.
The only issue of the complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott first for the Caribbean when Lyth was in a state of excellence, but that missed opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming with us, and there's a hitter I appreciate.
As a cricket player, there is something we saw early this season in Yorkshire when he scored 236 points against us in Trent Bridge.
He must at least be given the same opportunity as others before him, but of course this depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
There's been a ball of the idea of Moeen in the punching opening next to Cook, which would give us an extra feeder but could keep four fast, and I'm not against it.
I don't understand why a hitter couldn't hit there, and this left-handed man has already proved to be quite a cricket player.
Fashion may not have done its task in the province of Worcestershire, but he is three to them and there is little difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games at the first slowdown before he went to the opening in 2001.
He did three hundred points right away, and he didn't remember the past.
Zafar Ansari will become a thief to the team, and, as little as I've been dealing with him, he seems like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his unpretentious statistics, hitting an average of 31, with a ball of 35, and think it's gambling, but there's not too many feeders and electors to choose young ones.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have some tough additions to the coach's side.
The appointment of a Sri Lankan hitter in Mkörja Jayawardene as a consultant in games can prove to be a genius.
He's one of the nicest guys in the game, and he's got a huge amount of experience because he's done everything in all situations and all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes into the white ball games and brings with him both energy and an unspeakable jolt.
I have always thought that he was born to be involved in the international crisis, whether it be playing or coaching, and he has the same exploitable power as Mahela.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as in the past.
Colly's teammate Durham, Ben Stokes, rested in one day, gave Root a similar break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with this.
Even though not everyone agrees, the trainers and the electors do not make timetables.
And it must be remembered that just as players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions will never be made on a light basis.
Those in favour of leaving the EU (Brex) can win if the economy is in difficulty in 2017
David Cameron's half-hearted renegotiation strategies for keeping Britain in the EU are facing ever-greater problems every day, even though not even taking into account the heartful Jeremy 'Yes or no?' Corbyn's choice of the Labour Party's leadership or the anger of the trade union organisation with Europe on Tuesday.
The foreigners also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farags.
A European diplomatic partner recently explained that, because the EU is so deeply involved in various crises, of which not everyone has its own reason, some Member States are tired of the British self-centered agenda, which is full of dissenting concessions and disturbing contractual changes, which these countries do not want most of the time.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Confederation of Trade Unions decided that it would not want them either if they undermine social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, taking a picture of themselves in front of the famous local monument, either with or without the local eye, and then coming home saying that they are winning supporters of the reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outward within the British EU tent - 'Do not leave us alone with France', says Berlin - suggests that the shortest-sighted ministers and officials of certain capitals are now at a point where they will not care about us then we leave.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but he has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave his job before it is ruined in the same way that happened to the long-lasting Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France is facing a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's a evading force, too.
Poland may soon have a national right-wing government, a left-wing in Spain.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrifice themselves on behalf of the selfies when their energy should rather be directed towards preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want it because of similar separatist trends.
So, my friend is saying that some of these ministers can even deliberately plan to make useless remarks in the Scottish national party's style during the 2017 referendum campaign in Britain to speed up the Brexit process.
The renegotiation had been organised and the renegotiation had nothing to do with Britain.
Europeans have had a hard time experiencing how greedy the Fleet Street newspaper can be, and how EU-sceptical exclusive powers of the press are, which they were not inspired by Tony Benn at the time of the 1975 referendum, when our membership began in 1973 was confirmed at 2:1.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the largest Euro-opportunist, who named himself by writing 'EU direct bananas' as a Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a record of a number of strangers who visited taxes, foreigners who hacked phones, and people who were named elsewhere and who own most of our big newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought the same thing about them, but he realized that if you're in a cage with a horny gorilla, you have to give up bananas because of a conundrum unless you want to be on that gorilla's lunch list and later on at dinner.
As a matter of fact, Miliband was more blair than Blair itself, in the face of opposition to the renegotiation of Cameron, the fact that Bair had accepted the principle behind the European Constitution rejected by the French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgiven him for that either.
But a nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly killed me in the Westminster House on Monday (I say to him that he no longer has time to waste on me), seems to be in danger of re-administering Neil Kinnock's 80's boycotted Murdoch strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
Although it may take time, he has to develop a coherent strategy to keep in touch with the media, not to me, but no doubt to Andrew Marri, whose BBC power Corbyn left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official role in Europe is, to put it nicely, evolving.
He says that he would like us to remain in a renewed EU.
Well, most of the people outside the British Independence Party, the Ukipi military-painting and the most daring nationalist minds of the Conservative Party, can certainly stand behind this opinion.
Hilary's "Benn, but not Benn's fan" Benn said so on both the radio and TV this week when his inside patrolman would have liked to admit that the Corbyn's choice to appoint a rough John McDonald as the finance minister of the shadow government was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when her father-in-law was on TV trying to be unfaithful to his colleagues from the Labour Party without going so far as to lose his position as a government.
Hilary's tweakings were more attractive.
But the fight for us to stay in the "happiness" situation - the Benn statement - was not what McDonald said, nor everything that Corby told the headmen and the representatives of the people at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the unhiratic, emotional and personal image Corbyn wants to convey (remember that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the age of 24-hour TV, and especially in social media vortexes, which is a suitable growth platform for paranoia and fraud.
As McDonald has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to support the Labour Party in the referendum campaign himself.
At least that's what Simon Jenkins thinks.
However, the basic tour of McDonald and Corbyn on EU membership (and in line with their Benn-minded regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult debate among left-wing thinkers for whom the narcissism of small differences is central to dogmi in opiate skins.
As for his duality with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby is not campaigning to give up), foreign diplomats will just have to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why would Paris or Berlin want to waste political capital (they also have suspicious voters) in favour of Britain, when it can be completely futile?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed by the weak military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in the presence of a conservative government that cuts costs, as I was reminded of at the beginning of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticise Public Health England’s electric tobacco assessment
Researchers have said that the claim made by the State-funded agency that electric cigarettes are 95% less harmful than traditional ones started with 12 meetings, some of which had connections with the tobacco industry.
The experts writing to the British Medical Journal (BMJ) agreed with Lance on the evidence of electric tobacco used by critics in Public Health England (PHE).
PHE published this "the milestone" report last month, describing it as "a comprehensive review of evidence".
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data and referred to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The medical journal Lancet published last month a letter attacking the PHE's main conclusions on the "exceptional Hurricane Base".
Two other researchers at BMJ have wondered if the claims were "constructed on a rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: "The basic principle of public health is that policies should be established for proven effectiveness."
They say that the public expects that PHE's argument "at the moment, according to the best estimate, electric cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes" is based on detailed assessment and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from one of the 12 meetings that developed a multi-criteria decision-making model (MCDA) to synthesize their opinions on the disadvantages that are combined with different nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarised in the study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was the company called EuroSwiss Health, which was previously reported to have received funding from Bristish American Tobacco for independent research.
He also supported the public health powers of BAT in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting reported that they had received funding from the electric tobacco manufacturer, but not the funding he was reported to have received from Philip Morris International, a tobacco company.
The selection criteria for members of the panel are not specified, but the panel includes a number of well-known supporters of electric tobacco, some of which also indicate that they have received funding from the field of research.
Others were not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE's tobacco director.
The study carried out by the group "salviously admits" that there is a lack of "controversy with most of the products and most of the criteria", according to McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or restrictions are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say that PHE's claims that "for one thing, there is no evidence that electric tobacco acts as a way to burn children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of PHE’s health and well-being, says that the arguments put forward in the BMJ have previously been answered.
He says, "Smokers are much less harmful than smoking."
Half of those who smoke their lives die of addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electric tobacco are relatively small, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what evidence shows and what it does not appear, especially when there is so much public uncertainty about relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80 000 people die every year of smoking-related illness and smoking costs NHS £2 billion a year.
By explaining the current evidence - even though electric cigarettes are not risk-free, their disadvantages are only a fraction of the damage to traditional tobacco - we are fulfilling our national responsibility.
BBC should give up EastSenders, says former Channel 4 Director.
Former Channel 4 president Luke Johnson said that the BBC should stop sending programs such as EastSenders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "give anything" from such lates as this soap show on Albert Square Street.
Johnson said that the fees should only be used to make programmes that other British broadcasters do not do.
He criticises BBC for putting in public service programmes that are likely to have a smaller audience at difficult transmission times against the most viewed programmes of competitors and channels such as BBC4.
After Tony Hall, Director General of the BBC, said that the company wanted to cooperate more with other organisations, Johnson said that he tried Channel 4 for six years to establish a relationship with the BBC in vain.
"I do not understand the idea that BBC produces and sends programmes that are clearly suitable for non-substantial competitors," Johnson said to the Upper Room Communication Committee as part of its study of BBC's future.
If the licence fee is maintained - and I am not sure it would be a good idea for this media or in the long term - it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do not.
The Voice will be sent to the most important transmission time, because it is to receive as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else would show the show is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: "I do not understand why a regressive tax should finance programmes that could also be financed without state aid.
The Voice is one such and EastSenders another, without denying inside the house carried out.
To be honest, the other channels would give anything about it.
I don't understand how it's about a public service shipment.
I don't think that would weaken the BBC at all."
Channel 4 was led by serial entrepreneur Johnson from 2004-2010, who said that BBC was responsible for hunting the numbers of viewers 'for the purposes of the people working there, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support'.
His comments on the most popular series of BBC remind him of the comments of former Sky Director Tony Ball, who used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that BBC sell series such as EastSenders.
Johnson said that the public service programmes of the smaller audience at BBC "are going to BBC4, where it is often impossible to measure the number of viewers, but BBC thus fulfils its responsibility, and then can, by defending the license income of GBP 4 billion, show with hypocrisy that "of course, we are doing all these unknown programs, which no one looks at".
They put them on a missionary site where no one ever comes to see them.
With regard to the authorisation fee, Johnson said to the Committee: "I urge you to look for a more regressive system of who gets the most value for it.
Of course, you all think that we all think that 150 pounds a year gets a lot of value, but I don't know if that's right for people with 150 pounds of money, because they don't use much of the BBC.
David Elstein, former Sky and Channel 5, who also proved to the Committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should re-evaluate its early role as "information, training and entertainment".
He said that only a small part of BBC's production is now classified as education - he said that the figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should take a model of Australian and Canadian broadcasting and change the role of "information, education and entertainment".
As far as the partnership issues are concerned, Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on events such as Proms concerts, which he says are just some of them on TV, and join commercial companies so that they can all be seen online.
Sound genetics allows brain cell control by sound waves
The video shows how shuttle beams change direction as soon as the sound pulse hits them.
Researchers have grown worms with genetically engineered nervous systems to be controlled by sound waves.
Small - scaled submersibles change direction as soon as they are hit by a sound-pulse that is too high to be heard by the human ear.
Impulses function by switching on genetically engineered motion nerve cells with ultrasound-responsive membrane channels.
Subject: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Researchers said that worms indicate the functioning of a new method called sound genetics, which can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body by hand.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that one day the method may replace deep-brain stimulation, an invasive measure leading to electrical impulses in the human brain to treat Parkinson’s disease.
The shuttle worms did not normally respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when they were surrounded by liquid with microscopic small bubbles, the situation changed.
He found that bubbles reinforced ultrasound waves, which then entered the worms.
The confirmed ultrasounds affect the TRP-4-ion channels, the structures of some worms in the cell membranes.
The sound waves make these ion channels open and activate the cells attached to them, says the report published in Nature Communications.
In order to produce ultrasonic shuttle worms, Chalasani genetically engineered worms so that part of their operating nerve cells are TRP-4-ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasound on modified worms, the microbubbles reinforced the sound waves and transmitted them to the worms in which they turned on the operating nerve cells that were designed.
The method has some similar features to the optogenetics, a career tool that allows scientists to turn nerve cells on and off using light impulses.
However, Chalasani says that the use of sonogenetics may have some advantages compared to optogenetics.
Unlike the light that must be sent along the optical fiber to the desired point within the brain, low-frequency ultrasounds can travel through the tissue without barriers, so they can be sent to the brain from the skull.
"We believe that using gene therapy and therapeutic virus it may be possible to get the target human nerve cells to react instantaneously to the ultrasound signal in certain neurological treatments in the clinical environment", Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, and they added.

Advertise the arms trade in Britain
Check out the video against Amnesty International.
Horrible killing machines!

The joyous voice and cartoon image language leave no doubt that this advertisement of the world's largest station fairs is a sharp parody produced by Amnesty International in order to highlight the British government's willingness to trade weapons to the repression governments at the ExCeL Centre of the International ExCeL Centre in London's shipyard area.

As a result of a separate campaign, many posters appeared for bus stops and metro trains, requiring more information.
"The important information, will you travel on the DLR route from September 15th to September 18th?" one is asked using London underground font and brand, as the DLR track turns into a tank image.
This September, a bunch of arms dealers arrive on the DLR route... asking customers to help stop the weapons fair.
These 300 posters were made by artists who were present at the Museum of Cruel Designs of Banksyn Dismaland (the Museum of Public Planning).
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped spread posters all over London using the Ad Space Hack Packs packages. It is a six-pound package of six-pound six-block keys, which according to the collective, "to reach a third of the advertising space on the entire planet's bus stop".
Transport for London is not amused by this unauthorized "published vandalism".
One of the parody commercials produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to the Cruel Designs Curator and the University of Essex lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists increasingly question and want to take political work to outside the gallery.
A lot of artists have started working with activists on the opposition front when they realize that they must go to the outside world if they want their art to affect society.
Another anti-arms poster says hello to business travelers on the subway.
Amnesty video has been viewed through Facebook over 100,000 times in the last 24 hours. It was created free of charge by VCCP, as well as by a graphic designer and background writer who worked for free.
VCCP's creative director Matt Lever found that the station fairs were not advertised at all - and the ExCeL calendar also had an empty point - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They were playing with the idea of a more realistic advertisement of shady corruption, but "it was more stopable to stress it with bright colors and animation".
"They've done a fantastic job helping us to raise questions about illegal torture equipment sold at the fair," says Amnesty Tom Davies.
Now, the British Government must take action and ensure that the means of torture are not illegally sold near our home.
Perhaps the most creative art in connection with the substitute fair comes from the inside of ExCeL when exhibitors trade fantasticly decorated products.
He's got an order from the U.S. Army on the head of the AT4CS RS.
This includes a "one-off tube assembly kit that focuses excellent effects on the rear of the armour inside the target".
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student apartment
It's been 11 years since I was ignorant when I moved to a student apartment when I was 19, and then I believed in barettets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the violent smiles of the people I've irritated and the numerous, long complaints of others.
A large part of what I have learned can be summed up in eight simple rules.

The university is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many houses have a culture of walking from room to room, which is friendly, social, and cause lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell to someone who's trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say "I like you and I want to be a friend with you, but you have to leave now that I can collect back the energy I spent talking to you."
Try to sense when a student is tired of socializing, and perhaps send a text message to the door instead of knocking.
Knocking when the speech came: knock.
There was this guy in my frat house who thought that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw a lot of things.
Friendliness through bakery.
Since you're starting a university at the top of the bakery trend, knocking on people's doors with a chocolate pastry plate and showing yourself seems a little less strange, less "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something, now smile when I ask you some personal questions" -50-reader.
It's a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to talk, and it may be that in the future they will join your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you know how to bake.
Bad mixed flour-sugar-fats are likely to make people just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dorms.
Obviously, taking a chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk on your tea?
Ask and check with the owner of the milk.
It's possible they're gonna give you permission, even if they're boiling internally.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you get my sympathy, but try to take it more adult than my roommate who mixed detergent in her milk to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
You shouldn't make noises so people can't sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that proverbial pot playing a boiler.
In my hallway, the girl asked her neighbor if they could play the drum and bass music later because it was three in the morning and she had a exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally shut down at five in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep two hours before she put her own music up and locked her door and went to a three - hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dorm with you?
Or vice versa, wouldn’t it be incredibly embarrassing if you considered a roommate to be your future mate, you would get separated, and then you would see her every day and possibly lose all your friends to her?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, but if a hot roommate isn't your future spouse, you might even try to make sense of it.
In that exulting moment, when you find that someone has left his key in his unlocked room, the line between the trickery and the bullying is thinr than it seems.
A good trick is fun, but it'll be cancelled in a moment.
You can give a useful and fun lesson on safety by hiding something, but never mess up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys in a glass of water, which you'll put in the freezer, but don't attach their property to the roof on the blue tar than twice.
Racist attack on Kite on the residence of foreign students - The house planned as reception center was hurled in Salo
There was a racist attack on Kite in the home of foreign students on Saturday night in North Karelia.
Unlike the police told us before, it is not the accommodation facilities of minors, but the sleep facilities of foreign students who have already been in Finland, says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher at the Evangelical National University of Kite.
The windows and walls of the accommodation rooms of the National College were bled with racist signs, such as the hakarists, and a metal object had been thrown through the window of one of the accommodation rooms, says the Eastern Finnish police.
According to Luukkainen, who was responsible for providing social guarantee training to young people at the University of Nations, the building was supposed to have ten people at the time of the attack.
"There was a weekend and adult people are free to move, so there could be some elsewhere," says the Luukkainen.
The National Institute has people from 12 different nationalities on accommodation.
They have already been to Finland for some time, as well as recently arrived underage asylum seekers.
All the people in the messed-up building have a status.
Some are studying in adult basic school, some are studying professionally and some are studying in Finland," Luukkainen says.
A status is a so-called continuous residence permit, which can be granted for four years to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
The police of Eastern Finland investigate the attack as an act of harm and a violation of domestic peace.
According to Luhkkainen, on Monday an information meeting was held for the students, including the necessary interpreters.
There's no panic in here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for the past ten years, and this is the first time that something like this happens," Luukkainen says.
I don't know. I've got a lot of people saying the mess's already been cleaned out of the walls.
They were suspected to have been at least three men and had been on the move on a light passenger car.
I think this is the head of the youth weekend, when this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious," Luukinen says.
There is also a hospital planned for at the reception center in Salo.
The incident happened last week.
It was reported on the MTV website on Tuesday night.
The hospital wall was drawn by a hacker and written in English "You are not welcome".
There's been a criminal report to the police about this.
Amendment 15 September at 4:02 p.m. Repaired incorrect information provided by the police on the age and status of the people living in the building.
The state will put an end to the Y-train to the herd... passengers in their throats, "open idiotic"
The Y train from Helsinki to the Raasepor herd will cease to run in March.
The news upset the passengers going on the first night of the train in Helsinki's main railway station.
In particular, the downfall hit the Siuntians, said Torbjörn Bengtström, a municipality.
It's just idiotic, because the population is growing all the time and people at work need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be anything but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says on the HSTV interview video he'll be here with a tractor to the capital.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H- and R-trains on the main track are combined into a new R-line.
Purola's position in Lake Head and Nuppulinna in Tuusula are out of use.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on the route to be purchased by the Ministry during the following contract period.
The contract period will change at the turn of the year and there will be endless routes throughout the country.
The next four-year agreement, which will be finalised in the autumn, will be subsequently approved by the Committee on Finance.
The Siuntio Bengtström considers that the State’s train cutter is a short-sighted operation.
We make the same mistakes we have made in the past and we repeat them in a very systematic way.
And then there's a remorse.
The Y train is also used by people other than the Raaseporians and the Siuntians, because it is fast and passes several stations.
The fate of those travelling further beyond the city area was damaged by the train from the Espoon Annina Pöyry.
"It is particularly miserable for those who have to plan their journey again," he said when he was in pain on the Y train.
A little relief is promised.
There must be a new train connection to the beach, which will replace the Y-train in the Helsinki Region (HSL) area, which will take it to Kirkkonum.
This will increase the costs for HSL, i.e. in practice, for municipalities in the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now looking at different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to assess the costs accurately.
According to Rihtniemi, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid for the Y train in about a million years, of course, the Ministry is much more than that.
The R line on the main track misses two positions.
On the other hand, the number of train shifts in Ainola and Sauna Kallio will double.
A total of 28 small positions and numerous routes will cease across the country.
The Ministry no longer buys rail traffic from Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
Pieksämäki Joensuu route is shortened to Piksämäki-Varkus.
The trains are reduced on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka harbour and Kajani-Oulu.
More than half a million trips per year will be made on the ground that the total volume of transport purchased by the Ministry is about nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring EUR 12.3 million of annual savings to the state.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote in the book The Timeliness of Capital: "Marx should be studied"
The crises in the world economy have raised the surface of Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work, published in 1867-1894, Capital, of the former President of GDP, Yrjö Hakanen, in his book, Marxi Capital, published today.
He is now being taken more seriously than in a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx's estimates of the development of the capitalist economy, internationalisation and insurgency to all areas of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of capital capital and imaginary capital have proved to be surprisingly long-sighted.
The list of books organized by Hakasen based on the Capital Seminars also contains Professor of Aalto University, the highly respected Economist Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes Marx's current "Yet and Forever".
However, the former CEO of the Institute of Research in Business and the Delegation for Business is not Marxian, is he?
Not at all.
On the phone, Korkman says that he does not consider Marx as a current economic thinker but rather an interesting socialist.
Today, social sciences are distinguished and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and professor of literature.
"The usual concept is that the theory of the false opinions of dead men is to begin with," Korkman says.
It's true that Marx's predictions went seriously wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and meaning of the industrial revolution, he drew too far - reaching conclusions from the beginning of capitalism, Korkman wonders.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"The most relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now we are discussing again Marx's interests, such as the division of wealth.
"Marx may give inspiration to someone who wants to understand the big picture, the changing world as a result of the technical upheaval", Korkman analyzes.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is not going to help Marx.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should only end.
Still, Mr. Korkman thinks it's worth getting to know Marx.
"Can't read Marx in the '70s," Korkman says.
"The Maoist and Trotskys and the other sects hated capitalism, but even more so".
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also approach without the ideological and political weights of the years ahead.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's thinking world, like other classics," Korkman says.
The United Nations calls for war criminals to be convicted in Sri Lanka.
The UN calls for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes committed in the civil war in Sri Lanka, reports AFP.
The UN report on civil war in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both the Sri Lankan armed forces and the rebels known as Tamils of war crimes.
It is estimated that at least 100 000 people have died in the civil war in Sri Lanka.
There's no precise record of the number of victims.
In particular, the major attack by the armed forces in the last few months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, the UN report calls for.
The Sri Lankan armed forces report accuses torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which were as likely to be victims as men and women.
According to the report, rebels have been guilty of coercion of bystanders and children as fighters.
According to the report, both parties have committed murder.
On Wednesday, Sri Lanka replied that it intended to organise the investigation itself, but did not intend to allow the establishment of the UN Court of Justice because foreign judges.
In the yo test in England, the social media was hit.
On Wednesday a long foreign language, which most of the students had English, was in turn in the autumn.
More than 16,000 test subjects tested their English skills.
In the experiment, it could be written about social media.
Based on our own experience, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the English text 150-250 could have been addressed to the person holding the website’s advisory board.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt corresponds to the Finnish Leelian resting chair.
He was asked how parents could look at things for young people.
There were four subjects of the substance, one of which had to be chosen.
"It was the hardest of them", evaluates the third topic of Porvoo's Swedish-language high school in English by Mia Lybeck.
The third issue was merely a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth topic, Lybeck said it was nice.
It was supposed to write a fire speech about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school, we've been practicing to write words," Lybeck says, and evaluates the whole experiment as "almost normal".
In English or Swedish, questions were answered about texts, such as the adaptation of the summer camel to climate change and the processing of large data masses.
Some lengths of Russian (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written on Wednesday.
The autumn articles will continue on Friday, when there will be another Finnish or Swedish test.
In the upper grades, the test is organised normally, so the expression of the employees does not affect it.
The student qualification board invites testers to search for suitable connections in time to get to the trial.
Even more time can be obtained if it can be shown that the delay was not due to self - carelessness.
In Oulu, the shop was robbed at gunpoint.
In Oulu, on Wednesday morning, a store was robbed in the City of Kello.
According to the police, the kidnapper was dressed in dark clothes and a face-covering commando.
He's normal, and he's about 30 years old.
According to the police, a man had threatened his staff with a handgun and received a small sum of money.
They're investigating this case as a serious robbery.
Police are preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of protestors in Helsinki - support teams from elsewhere in Finland
The government's anti-surgery demonstration will block the centre of Helsinki on Friday, predicts the police.
According to preliminary information, even tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, Akava and STK alliances will meet at the railway station at 11 a.m.
Policemen are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
The police at work, on the other hand, are responsible not only for the alarm and other police activities, but also for ensuring that the giant expression is smooth.
The roads leading to the railway station are closed from motor vehicles for about 9.30-14 hours.
Only alarm vehicles are allowed to enter the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic will be cut from the direction of Kaisaniemi to the direction of the west from the direction of Mannerheiminti.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
For the time being, it looks like it's enough.
I don't take a position on the police's work-related issues.
According to Kujala, support teams from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki because of the demonstration.
The police won't tell us about the exact patrol.
"There is a certain amount coming, but as a rule, we can do it on our own," Kujala says.
The police are calling for the avoidance of private car traffic in central Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic route extends from Hakaniemi level to the core centre.
Standby traffic is expected from the morning to the early night.
With protestors from other parts of Finland, there are also many ordering buses to Helsinki.
They won't be allowed to go to the Railwaydent.
The buses are basically quite far away.
Then we'll have to walk to the demonstration site," Kujala says.
The expression also stops Helsinki’s public transport.
From the point of view of the police, there's a positive side.
The question of fluidity in public transport, which is normally addressed in these large crowds, is now partly self-sufficient.
The organisers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of government economic policy may enter Helsinki.
The police expect the demonstration to be smooth.
After all, the people are ordinary working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
The Finns are reasonable and peaceful people," Kujala says.
Local demonstrations are also held throughout Finland on Friday.
On Friday, the expression of mind is unusual in many ways - do you remember these strikes and expressions of mind?
The great demonstrations organised by trade unions on Friday are interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is no very good reference point in Finnish political history, says Martti Siisinen, professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It's no wonder the Ay movement protests.
If it didn't, it would raise your hands in front of the government," says Siisinen.
A very right-wing government has taken on the core points of Finnish corporateism - and also on points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard grips are missing in contract law.
There are a lot of features here that the Ay movement is really trying to get on its knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement also has a place to look at the mirror.
For example, a mirror is needed because the Ay movement does not have the support of all employees for Friday's demonstrations.
The new one is now the steep division whose expression of mind brings about amongst those whom the Ay movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
The unemployed from all over Finland expressed their views at the Parliamentary House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a reference point for Friday’s demonstration, it could be the giant demonstration of the unemployed, Murrostorstai, in 1993, says Siisinen.
In the middle of the deepest recession, Murrostorstai gathered 20,000 unemployed persons.
The government of Esko Ahon tripped from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relations between the Finnish Government and the employees' organisations had never been as bad as they were during Aho's bourgeois government.
Now the government and the Ay movement may be even worse than in the days of Murrostorsta.
Besides, Finland's most bourgeois government is now in power, says Siisinen.
The current government coalition is still so interesting that it is so strictly right, despite the speeches made by the Finnish basics.
There were certain elements of the old labor movement at the time of the gloom.
Thousands of protestors are expected to be present on Friday.
The expression also stops public transport and possibly closes day-care centres and schools.
Although the expression of mind does not receive the indivisible support of employees, it can become the largest for years.
In Helsinki, around 300 protests have been organised annually in recent years.
They're all over the floor.
Traditionally, the demonstrations of the Finnish Ay movement have been quite peaceful, even though in recent years the methods of action have tightened up.
Traditionally, Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is law-abiding.
The protestors seek to avoid damage to or destruction of property, says Sisinen.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of demonstration has changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police prepared to get pig shit on them.
The firefighter strike lasted three months in 1998.
Among other things, pilots and air traffic controllers had visible strikes.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical varnishes of the 1970s
The most important strikes in the 1970s were metal strike in 1971 and power strike in 1977.
70,000 metal men participated in the metal men strike.
The strike was suspended by a committee of reconciliation after seven weeks of the strike.
Metal men received a 16% raise.
In the spring of 1977, the electric strike lasted 49 days and caused power failure throughout the country.
Migration in 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20 000 people met at the Parliamentary Assembly, many of which have been made unemployed, to show their support for the work.
Firemen strike for three months in 1998
Firemen's strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, unless the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were caught in egg rain in the protest of farmers against the EU in 1994.
"Siberia teaches, the EU stops", was one of the slogans.
For Espa, the farmers put tons of snow on it.
The EU Summit in Helsinki in 1999 also caused farmers to protest and burn hayballs in front of the meeting place.
The nurses strike in 1983 and 1995
For about a month, the nurses struck in 1995.
The last time they had been in strike in 1983.
The 1995 strike was painted by a few deaths during the strike.
The factory threatened with a strike and mass layoffs of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass deportation eventually speeded up the negotiations.
Doctors licked 2001
"Doctors in the strike - from the obligation" was the slogan of strike doctors in 2001.
The strike of municipal health centres and hospital doctors lasted for five months and resulted in a lively discussion on how the strike could compromise patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the salaries of doctors.
Students moving in 2013
About 5 000 students marched for study support in Helsinki from the Senate to the Parliamentary House in 2013.
Central Crime Police will find out the backgrounds of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police for help in finding out the backgrounds of the refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped at Aisterheim near the German border with 42 refugees.
It is not known whether the truck was potentially on its way to Finland.
Those on the truck were all in good condition.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
Investigation and main responsibility are at the scene in Austria, says Inspector Tero Haapala of the Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling with a truck in Austria became more fatal.
At that time, it appears that all 71 passengers on board died by suffocation.
According to the General Radio, which first reported cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited company.
Among other things, the company operates a restaurant and its CEO is a foreign-based man, about 40 years old.
In Austria, there have been two arrests for human trafficking in Iraq.
Captain beating refugees, a former drug dealer and a sublime businessman - the story of five smugglers.
The subprime king of smugglers, the violent boat driver, the stylish missionary and a cab driver who thinks he's a good guy.
Such people, for example, carry on transporting human beings to the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci at the University of Trento have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and their written book Death Travel Agency will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the hips of trafficking in human beings, put forward proposals for solutions and introduce smugglers from different steps of the business.
HS presents five of them.
I'm gonna beat the crap out of them right now.
The islands of Kerönna on the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians are heading there for a summer holiday.
On behalf of their location, the islands are also ideally suited for smuggling, as the island of Lampedusa, Italy, is only 120 km away.
For comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, the captain who burns in the chain, and the father of six children.
The islands are famous for their shrimps, but the fishermen are more profitable in transporting people.
That is what Emir has done hundreds of times on his blue, ten-metre wooden boat.
If the boat's full, it'll fit 40 people.
After one trip, Emir earns around 8 000 euros.
Emir has five assistants looking for clients all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab spring a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until another outbreak of the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the island of Kerkenna in small groups.
Emir will house them in empty houses for as long as he can see.
Food is given in such a way that customers just and just stay alive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer runs out of money, that's their problem.
We're going to go to the water with the lights shut down in the middle of the night.
The first night is driven off the islands, then stopped, expected the day and driven to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and passengers cry and vomit in waves of 20 metres [20 m] high.
At the destination, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir is on his way back.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats his clients, and at least he says he's gonna beat the hangers to death.
He tells us in the book that once the police reached out to him, he threw all his passengers over the side and ordered them to swim to the nearest island.
"I needed customers one by one from the neck and threw them over the side," Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of Sahara.
I hear his countrymen are gonna have to take care of this.
I'm gonna beat the crap out of them right now.
We need to show them who's in charge right now.
Just a regular cab driver.
Goran's a very common cab driver in Bocovasha, Serbia.
His cab's not very good. The starter engine's been running around, and he's seen his best days anyway.
The most important thing for Goran’s customers, however, is that the taxi is moving at all, moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovasha is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers from Belgrade to the southwest.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where families are mainly allowed.
In forests around the centre without their families, men are staying in tents, lava and abandoned cars, which everyone has now managed to find or build.
Families living in the forest who have not for any reason or for any reason submitted an application for asylum to Serbia.
Some also stay in private dwellings, but it's a public secret.
In the forest population, Goran finds most of his clients.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of border crossings and weekly walks in difficult areas, often in mountain areas and in the dark.
At the end of their arrival in the territory of Bogovasha, at the nodule of large human smuggling, people are dying.
The Goran cyclists are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistani, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their thing once, and that's enough," Goran says.
He says the Africans are trying to make a move.
That's what Goran doesn't like.
Stupid fool all the way.
For example, the price will be set at 300 euros, then they will put it down to 200 and eventually offer 150 euros.
Goran insists he's a nice and kind man.
I don't care about the money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran says he's doing a job cheaper than the others, and he's going to charge 50 euros to the Hungarian border.
It is a third hundred kilometers away, most comfortably on the freeway.
I hear colleagues are asking for a three or four-fold price.
Goran earns around EUR 50,000 a year.
It's not a big deal for a smuggler, but in Serbia, it's a pretty nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis do not carry migrants within 12 km of the Hungarian border.
Goran does not care: he knows the roads and the shortcuts and takes his rides a mile from the border.
Then he points his customers in the right direction and shakes them out.
At Work of Consequences
A 35-year-old Congolese is called the Missionary, and it's not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant church in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, with many believers fleeing the Congo, and a small center to help the Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing the work of mercy.
It's important for the messenger to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and makes sure that white-headed underwear picks up elegantly under the low-belt of jeans.
The messenger is proud of his new Mercedes, his off-road vehicle, and his three motorcycles.
When the missionary does not preach, he organises people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
At first, the customer calls from one of the five telephone numbers of the Messenger.
He advises that it is worth arriving at the border in the morning, hiding the money, and drifting into the midst of the traffickers crossing the border.
In order to obtain the status of an asylum seeker or refugee, the Ugandan authorities must be told that they are from, for example, the war zones of North Kivu and that they have had to flee from their homes for violence.
Often it is true, but if it is not, the Messenger will arrange a new identity for the customer.
The old I.D. will be destroyed and another will be acquired.
It's helping the Ambassador's contacts with the Ugandan police.
After that, the customer will be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers will go: asylum application, non-governmental organisations, and finally the UN refugee organisation to the UNHCR.
The missionary knows the bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He invoices each portal separately: lodging an application to the Ugandan police costs about €100, handling documents to a humanitarian organisation about €150, and the migration process, for example, to a European country of €4 500-7 000.
Folio and ice blocks
Tom is a beginner, a former drug dealer.
Four-year-old Irishmen are on a patrol on the French coast in Calais, where his job is to load people into the trucks on their way to Britain.
He has a Afghan, French cab driver, and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they're in a human secret transport business in London.
At night, Tom and the cab driver picked up their clients, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near Calais Center.
They're driving the freeway A26 and they're trying to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car on the freeway, Tom and the driver would go directly to prison for illegal immigration.
That's not what Tom wants. He's been sitting here seven years for drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom runs across the freeway with his clients to a resting place where the drivers sleep before continuing across the canal to Brittie.
Tom picks the right truck to make sure it's on its way to England right now, not to the Netherlands, but to cut the safety line for the cover.
It must be done quietly so that the drivers do not wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wrapped his client in an aluminium foil, similar to the one wrapped in the kitchen around a cooker or oven potato.
It's supposed to stop the police's thermal scanner from detecting a hideout.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the place hoping that he doesn't drive any sudden travelers before Britain.
King of smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous human traffickers in the world.
An up-to-date Turkish citizen has been called the master of marketing and an undisputed king of illegal Mediterranean landings, which governs sea routes from Turkey to the EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and has been constantly developing new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage vis-à-vis other entrepreneurs: he only demands the money.
One of the new methods is a luxury submerge: Turkish ports are rented out of the port to take American or European families to a few days of tourist cruises.
In reality, ships will be loaded into a full range of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurdishs and Afghans, who will first be transported from Istanbul to a port and from there to Europe against a fee of EUR 5 000-7 000.
Customers are stored in human stocks, for example in old industrial halls until it is time to leave.
People get caught in mini-buses and drive somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it is given, you must board quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden under cover for the entire journey.
The Marine Guard can only observe how deep the ship is swimming, as no other sign of the crowd is visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers ejaculate and vomit, the better.
Küçük will receive some €53 000 for one luxury ship after the cost.
He does not handle practical matters himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, lodgings and other smaller factors to do the work for himself.
During the summer season, transports will take place at least hundreds and Küçük will make millions.
He is believed to have bought land through cover companies, a pharmaceutical company, and over a hundred flats he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 with a representative of the Democratic Party of Turkey and an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical sector.
Apparently, since then, he's disappeared.
Corrigendum 16.9.2015 at 15.10: The Death Travel Office book will appear here, not next week.
In his book about his illness and becoming a prostitute, an American Olympic drunk says:
Three times at the Olympic Games, Suzy Favor Hamilton’s new book, a 1 500 - foot - long racer, has attracted attention in the United States.
In his book Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton tells about ending his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated-letter published breaks about the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the top of the game and ran for the second best time.
But in the final, he was panicking.
Right at the beginning, he rushed to the top and defended his lead with a manic run.
Yet, 150 meters before the finish, his strength ran out.
He collapsed into the track, and the other competitors passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot and thought I'd never run again.
However, I forced myself over the line of goals, Favor Hamilton explains in his book.
Later, it became apparent that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before Sydney’s competitions, and he himself felt enormous pressure for success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of making money for having sex with strangers.
He also overspoked his husband to accept his actions.
Favor Hamilton's cab was EUR 450 per hour.
He says he spent the money on luxury life.
One of Favor Hamilton’s explanations about becoming a prostitute was that he needed the same adrenaline spikes as he had been competing in sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton discovered that he was ill with bipolar disorder.
The double life of the former star runner came out at the end of 2012, when the Smoke Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000 he was the world’s statistical 1 at 1500 meters at 3.57,40, but remained the last of the Sydney Olympics.
The world champion cheered when the alliance put Norway's skis under control:
The Norwegian ski king Petter Northug has exceeded the limits of suitability for at least one of his colleagues.
The Northug and the Norwegian Skiing Federation have turned the whole summer and the last year of the autumn into a sports agreement.
Even though the alliance has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been good enough for a multiple world champion and the Olympic champion.
The Norwegian Ski Association decided to exclude Northug from the world cup of the coming season.
The decision was given thanks to the double world champion, Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he'd be glad the alliance put the ski down.
"Thank you for pointing the spine," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one of the active athletes to avoid working for the union's sponsors," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian skiing union and Northug is about money.
The Northug seems to want to be part of the season's country team so he can promote his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent a union that also takes care of future generations and does not give one athlete with the salts.
At the same time, he recalled that the Union has granted Northug both economic and other privileges for many years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that a single athlete has different rules than just because he has the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own release, which assured him that he wanted to be brave in Norwegian colours next season in the World Cup as well as in the World Cup after the World Cup and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six MM medals, two gold medals.
He was a part of the team that won the messenger gold last winter in Falun.
The Tortoise Day is also celebrated in the Nordic Country.
On the day of September 25th, a stopover takes place at various restaurants and shops, which have been awarded the Bread translater shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high level of food expertise and lower the threshold for going to a restaurant, and to raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, it is recalled that not all high-level restaurants are concentrated in the capital region, but the top restaurants inspected and classified by an impartial operator can be found around Finland.
The international attention received is an indication of the importance of the event as part of increasing the visibility of the turtle restaurants and the organisation.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is held in the restaurant Fondisi and Kantarellis in Vaasa.
In Kokkola, the Tortoise Day is attended by the Old Town restaurant.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It was decided to make the event one of the most significant international events of the organization, which will take place in the same day across the world.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kahahaoki-lehti: the establishment of Kauhava reception centre applied to the Chancellor of Justice
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a refugee reception centre for the premises of the current Kauhava ex-registery owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the area continues to be permanently located in the critical infrastructure of the crisis period, which is at the disposal of the Defence Forces and its partner, the Finnish Special Networks Oy.
According to the Kahahaoki magazine, the investment of the reception centre in the same building would constitute a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interests in the area and airport of the former Aviation School, the impact of which has also not been clarified in the preparation of the reception centre, is written in the newspaper.
The case states that negotiations have been held over the last two years on the organisation of flight training and the outcome of any foreign operator at the airport.
This has been discussed, among other things, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy.
The private person points out to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not a matter of principle opposition to the reception centre, but of the fact that the intended location in the former reserve area is wrong.
The City Government of Kahavan dealt with the reception center issue last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The administration means that the immigrants and the people here have the necessary conditions, and the Niinistö commented to journalists in the evening after meeting the presidents of all the parliamentary parties in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, concern about the management of the refugee situation was linked to all the participants.
He values the ability of the government and opposition parties in Finland to discuss the fundamental issues in a confidential manner.
Especially in these days when we face great challenges
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and the activities of Russia and the United States in the region may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, the Baltic Sea region.
Nimbles are hopeful of the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia will be able to do so, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and the continuing tension in the Baltic Sea.
According to Niistö, the NATO issue was also addressed in the discussions.
The President did not take a position on the labour market situation.

Media investigator: Sipila takes a high risk
According to Sipila, communication requires a wide range of channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio calls are one of the other channels.
Such a direct speech channel will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä said to journalists in the Parliament.
The Sipila did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister's television and radio calls become.
According to Sipila, talks may not always be conveyed on the Ylen channels.
If other channels report as a channel, then let's see.
Now we're using this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipila, Finland's economic situation is so serious that it requires television and radio to be given to its citizens.
This issue, which we are talking about, is quite complicated and calls for a longer justification.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipila figured it out.
The speech will be sent at 21.05-21.20 both on TV1 and radio in Finland.
You can also watch it in Yle Areena.
Sipila takes a high risk
The media scientist hopes that Sipilä's television talk will not tell us about a more general introvertion of the government.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define a public debate more firmly into your own hands and to refuse to discuss the issues of public debate?
I recall Mr Soin's recent comment that he does not respect the media agenda and does not allow it to define itself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these matters are not related.
Koivunen understands that commercial media is inflamed by Sipilä's announcement.
It would be strange if the media didn't react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not democratic issues.
The role of the representatives of the media is to try to ensure that political agendas are not taken into account.
According to Koivuse, TV talk is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, the Sipila should bring something new and specific to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations of the speaker.
Is there more that we've already heard?
Or can he speak in a different tone, in a different way or in different words, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old thing in the permit, then you must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
In that sense, too, if this is not a particular situation, it is a routine speech among others.
The danger is that Yle will be labeled as a message from politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in line with the interest or general policy of Yle.
♪ On the side of a clever bet ♪
In the future speech by Sipila, what the Prime Minister does not say is also important, the media researcher stresses.
In the evening we should look closely at where Sipilä is missing and what is not, says Jyväskylä University Research Coordinator Heikki Kuuti.
According to the Six, TV talk is a clever bet from Sipila, because it allows this to bring out its own view without a gravel voice.
This will give a public audience without a journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The Sipila will pass the media and speak directly to the people.
The danger, however, is that the media misunderstands something about speech because more specific questions cannot be asked.
According to the Six, it's very important how Sipila appears on TV, let's see if we can get sweaty, shake hands.
He compares Sipil to the father figure, which now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can do her job well, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government were to inform about something, because in this man, as if he were speaking directly to another person.
This is what Obama and his partners do on a regular basis ( President Barack of the United States).
That's really extraordinary.
Political scientist Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to the public to be truly exceptional.
According to him, this has not happened for decades when the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional times require exceptional means, Railo says.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister would like to make the Finns sympathetic to the blackmails ahead.
Wage organisations organise demonstrations and strikes against government activities on Friday.
The President of the Left Union, Paavo Arhinmäki, says on Twitter that Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, in order to allow the speech to be discussed.
The President of the SDP, Antti Rinne (sd.), again announces his challenge to Sipilä's dialogue.
We don't have time for monologues.
Soon, six months after the election.
You can't hide forever, Rinne writes on Twitter.
The boy on a 9-year-old runaway has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time.
He's been hit, and in KUNNO, the boy's father upgraded to his Facebook page.
The Homeland Police Department will also confirm the case to the Evening Journal.
He went out for four o'clock this afternoon.
Later tonight, she was never contacted.
Dad thanks everyone who helped me find them.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
This update was distributed nearly 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short period of time.
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed in the violent wildness of young people: You will have hatred.
The Kurdita-based free candidate Makwan Amirkhani published a video on Facebook, which appeals in particular to young people from immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani considered the speech against the street fights of young people.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and arriving in Finland at the age of five, has so far won both her professional match in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirhani tells me he received a message asking him to look at a Instagram account.
Videos have been downloaded in which young people fight with extreme violence.
Amirhani tells me he's disappointed in the wild.
The 26-year-old Amirkan has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
You guys kick on the ground, sit on the other side, and take no notice of any of these consequences when you make these videos, the Amirhani updates.
It's hard to defend
Some of the young people in the video have an immigrant background.
According to the Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinosen, both immigrants and young people from Finland have downloaded fighting videos into social media.
It's the fact that you guys are fighting in the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, Turkish Amirkhani reminds you.
Amirkhani recalls that there are websites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These isolated cases have come to a very serious extent.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you now.
You should remember that you're still in a foreign country and you're going to be guests for quite some time.
That's a different way to thank you for being here, Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges the young to remember their loved ones.
If they ever become the target of some kind of racism, you're gonna have to blame yourself for it.
Now think about it a couple of times before you guys go along with something like that.
Amirhani says that violent acts are a factor in racism.
You're the kind of hate I don't like.
You've got things pretty bad anyway, and that's not gonna make it any better, Amirkhani will decide.
SAK puts its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
The president of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, says on Twitter that the employees' organisation will consider its position on Monday in the alternative savings list presented by the STK.
Lauri Lyly commented on St.T.K.'s proposal on Twitter.
On Wednesday, STTK, the HRC, informed the Government of its proposal to achieve the 5% productivity gap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central).
Mr Fjäder, President-in-Office, believes that the Government will accept the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest wage and salary organisation SAK soften its previous position.
The president of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, made a brief comment on the matter on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will be working on this matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open up the labour market", and that, instead of coercive laws, there is a need for agreements concluded by active parties.
Lyly recalls that Prime Minister Sipilä's proposal for a social agreement was not acceptable to the SAK.
In the past, Sipila cut off the negotiations on a social agreement when SAK refused to commit itself to the objective of a 5% productivity gap.
Comment: The big talk is threatening to pass - "It feels a little funny to put a fist"
You know, it's kind of funny to put a fist in your pocket, if there's a reconciliation paper in your pocket, it's Pekka Tiinane.
The atmosphere varies from side to side in the employees' camp.
Is it supposed to call the government off or make a deal with it?
On Monday, the Federal Directors of the SAK took up holy hatred for the government of the Republic.
All of Finland was threatened to shut down.
The threat spread even to the Africans.
OAJ, a teacher's trade association, threatened to close schools and day care centres.
On Tuesday, OAJ withdrew: none of the schools or day care centres are completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd) was the chairman of the HRC.
He said that he had contacted the government and that he would draw up the alternative proposal requested by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) as a 5% productivity gap.
Mr Sture Fjäder (cok), President-in-Office, was quick to announce that his paper was already ready.
At first, the SAK's office didn't even belong to the yard.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to agree when the federal leaders just ordered the country to stand up on Friday.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to deal with the situation and that SAK would look for solutions to "open up the labour market lock".
In order to create a joint proposal for employees, the SAK should tend to accept a 5% productivity gap as an objective.
No wonder Palola's STK has a good relationship with Sipila's government.
The right hand of the Palace, Jukka Eminus, director of the social impact of the STK, used to be a special assistant to the central prime ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kiviniemi.
The fire was therefore characterised by the fact that the government's knowledge of ay has always improved.
Coincidence or not, but the entrance to Palola took a little bit away from the Finnish skirmishers, whose premiere of the wedding was the ACP Marko Piirainen (sd).
I mean, it's kind of funny to put a fist in if there's some reconciliation paper in the pocket.
Modified at 18:00: Added information on Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
The President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, criticised the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
According to the President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, Mongolia is better than Finland.
In the capital of Mongolia, the session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly in Ulan Bator has started, where Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the Helsinki July Festival.
At that time, Finland did not allow the arrival of Russian politicians from the European Union's sanctions, such as Naryshkin, to attend a meeting - a matter which the President held to remind journalists of.
We believe that this was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again. Naryshkin stressed the news office according to the Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin's criticism was directed at the United States, where his access had also been prevented.
The words are political suicide from the EU, the Naryshk proclamation.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation was able to overcome the challenge, so Narysh also continued to blush Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for its "excellent organisation".
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with the most positive results - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The leadership of Mongolia understands that parliamentary dialogue should not have obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanervan (cok), who presides over the meeting at Ulan Bator, who, according to Russian media, has already spoken with the Russian delegation.
The lock meets the real playoff troll: "Paints in tight"
Killer and Clairvoyant continue in Hakametsa today when both are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti expects no actual goal party tonight in Hakametsa.
The killer went to Kuopio yesterday to pick up a 3-2-long-term victory from KalPa.
The rise was mild, since last season's silver team was worst at the loss of two goals.
The lock on Tuesday was more complex.
The Raumian catch was a guest of Blues, who started with a back-up, with a round zero point, and loss readings as well as 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if any of them play the same game as last year, Locker Janne Lahti anticipates positions on the club's pages.
The killer has become quite a playoff nightmare for the ironics.
In the last two years, the killer has just dropped the lock in the middle of the finals.
A decisive seventh match has been required on both occasions.
In the last season, the lock took the series to a break in the fourth game, but Tappera rose in three of the following breasts and passed.
There are no major changes to the group's configurations except for the goaltakers.
Both of the cashiers who fought last night will be on the table today.
With the goal of killing Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhus, and between the lock pins Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Face: A bad play is running at the top
The Sport Director Toivola wrote a copy of an inappropriate extension to Rautakallio, writing from Santtu Silvennoinen Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone wrote a Rocky movie where he played the main part himself.
The answerer sensibly set up a heavyweight series for the world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a lot of sympathy, even though he finally lost the title fight.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Toivola wrote a restless Cinderella story to Pori.
The anonymous and wooden pasta package advanced to surprise everyone with the SM finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous, but tough, underdogs like Rocky.
There was White Indian, Porin Matt and Pele Pelto.
In the falling games, the players colored their heads red and cut the irokes.
The hopeful one became a blonde.
The great TV reporter, JP Jalo, called Coach Neumann.
Aces took the won silver.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
The writer, Toivola, believes that this season’s novel works in the same way as ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports executive for the ace has built a pasta on the basis of bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been rotting shit in the remote like Rocky's pig carcases at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäe, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparis are in a game other than a puck.
Toivola has forgotten that in Rocky VI, the main part is Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has crossed the Ironallion to Sean Connery.
In Rocky, Toivola’s handwriting work, the main performer was as clumsy as Connery would have been in the original work of 1976.
There's nothing in the iron rock to Rocky but a nickname.
The game philosophy of the Iron Fallion does not include rushing and small-scale fishing.
He appreciates the hard game, but it's different to play hard than a pig.
In the last season, the Aussian Garret Stafford taced the Lamb’s Jere Shepherd’s head.
He got two and ten minutes from the judges, but Rautakallion put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We're the only ones who deserve to play.
I don't accept such a game, and it's not part of the ass-knife, and the hot iron-knifeed Iron-knife woke up after the game to the Satakuntan People.
The team of this season has been strangely built.
There are trains, veterans, policemen, and smugglers.
There are no key men of the best age in the game.
No wonder the head coach's been complaining about the art project.
How much have you been able to influence a player's acquisition, Pekka Rautakallion?
Last season's events affect procurement and unfortunately the situation on the market was rather narrow, Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
Under the surface of the stove.
The 1953 Ironfallio model is known to be interested in moving to Toivola's place as a sports boss.
Men's contracts will end in the spring.
The ace balance in the three leagues of the season is equal to the loss of goal difference 1-6.
Toivola shouldn't have written the rest of the script.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuki's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband when she was a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
For the first time, Olga Temonen acts under the guidance of her husband.
Yes, I'm playing my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
It kind of feels crazy, the actor and the producer Olga Temonen laughs.
She has been married to the A beyond-bassist and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple has worked a lot together before, but now Olga plays under Tuuka's direction for the first time.
Olga's role in the film You made us beautiful The mother of Sipe Santapuki is a drummer.
Sirkka semppapa and supports his son, even though his father Risto (to present Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I have become acquainted with my true example of Sirka, the easier it seems to be to play the role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me with the part.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but since then the twin has approached a lot.
They've met, they've been on the phone, they've been on the phone.
Sirkka's been very helpful.
We've been through a lot of different angles through their history.
Fortunately, the circus also understands that drama is a drama and the truth may have to be a little coloured.
Olga stresses that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apuland would become Finland's largest band.
It was a recession in the '90s, and it was really bad.
There was a little chance that someone would actually make it, but Sirka had some intuition, and she was right.
Olga tells us that she had heard a lot from Tuukka about this youth even before the movie plans.
However, the parents ’ stories have sometimes been slightly different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how many parents really know what you were doing.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from Tuuka, who was known as Heinola’s notorious skater.
Olga was an ordinary and kind girl who wouldn't have had anything to do with Tuuka.
At most, he could've been secretly enchanted.
According to Olga, she's been working so hard with Tuuka for 10 years that a big joint project is not afraid.
It's always been the best thing.
Now the whole production group leaves for a month for the shoots in Heinola.
True, the couple living in Iti often plan to drive home overnight because of their small children, because the distance is not too long.
We'll take Heinola for the whole month.
They have welcomed us very warmly, only to ask which streets and when will be emptied.
Iron Sky 2 rose to Finland's most expensive play movie
The budget of the Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, is EUR 17 million.
The shoots will begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola begins filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
The follow-up to Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, is becoming Finland's most expensive drama film with a budget of EUR 17 million.
In the past, the title of the most expensive Finnish film has been Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation, which is under way, will also rise when it is completed past Iron Sky 2, as the film has a budget of over EUR 100 million.
Timo Vuorensola’s film and film by Tero Kaukomaa starts in October at the AED Studios premises near Antwerp and lasts for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium next week.
The garbage budget isn't scared.
I've been so tired!
I'm so relaxed about the script because I know exactly what it's like to be a movie.
Everyone in the working group seems to realize that something has been done.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, he'll tell the Evening magazine.
Originally, 8-10 million were planned to be the film budget, but as the script developed, the budget also grew.
The budget's big, but there's a big story.
However, 100 million would be intruded in the film, because each angle and the effects are so expensive.
Now everything's been turned so tight that there's not a single find.
On Wednesday, the film production company Iron Sky Universe launched a mass finance campaign and a bond, with an annual interest rate of 4-8 per cent.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
In no later than two years, the company will repay the loan.
The film plays the role of Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junk or cool?
Big logos return to their shirts
In recent times, large logos have decorated the fronts of trends.
A while ago, a fashionable dresser avoided clear and large logos like Crocs in a console.
The advertising of a hood or a T-shirt was seen as a bit of a dung.
But times change.
Sport has become a megatrend of fashion, and so have the old, familiar sports fashion brands such as Adidas and Nike.
And like so often before, the funny and trendy border is fluctuating: if something is right, it begins to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. the tavis fashion, where trends surprised us by favouring as boring basic clothes as possible as a means to separate themselves from mass.
Instead of putting on a grey basic college, the vervain that is buried on the bottom of the cabinet, before which the manufacturer's logo is in front of it, is being added.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, Adidas is also identified by track blacks, the favorite team’s gaming shirts and the New York Yankees caps have made a return to street fashion.
Now, Calvin Klein logos are cool detail at the edge of the jeans.
The trend seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands.
For example, the front of the Versace fall buffers makes it clear what brandy clothing is all about.
Would you be ready to introduce the logos when you dress?
The Russian politician published the proof: I didn’t get caught in the tank’s hatch!
It has been claimed that a special incident would have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, where Russian Arms Expo, rapporteur of the Russian military industry, was held.
In recent days, the Russian media has spread colourful claims that the Russian emergency department had to remove large-scale Zoovia from the tank hatch for five hours.
Since then, Zotov has done everything in his power to deny the information.
He even published on his own public Facebook pages a picture in which he seems to be peeking at the door of the armored vehicle in quite a good mood, and not, at least, on the basis of those images, it is nothing to get stuck or angry.
It's total nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go in the combat armored wagon. It was an assault tank BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier myself, Colonel. I've served at Ural.
I went in there, looked around and came out in peace, and Zotov said to Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I wasn't stuck, and I didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
To the Russian army TV channel, Zotov explained his desire at the exhibition for new Russian technology because he was himself a professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what was inside the carriages. I was looking forward to our technology.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And I'm definitely going to visit every tank and every tank in the next show, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the journalist who wrote about it stupid.
One idiot wrote and everyone else repeated it.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside and came out.
I'm tall and ratty, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere, didn't happen, he said Russkaja sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov’s words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged hover have been published, although a total of 50,000 people attended the arms show in a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck started with the Bloknot.ru site where Zotov was told about his ribs when he tried and threatened to shoot everyone around if he didn't get out of his garage.
Later, the Bloknot site published a follow-up story in which the organisers of the exhibition reported their views on what had happened.
Everyone's just used to soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles.
But Congressman Zotov, because of his size, simply stayed when he came out.
But in no way did he sit there for five hours, said the coordinator of the exhibition to Alexander Pisarevski Bloknot.
Here's the favorite item of decorating bloggers
Architectural brothers Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) The candle of Lassen from 1962 seems to have been designed today.

There has been a leak at Agnico Eagle Finland's Kittilä mine, a Canadian-owned mining company.
After the clean process water of the gold mine, the so-called enrichment sand pool has leaked into the stream.
According to the company, the measures to repair the leak have been initiated.
In the pool is the neutralized enrichment sand and purified process water from the foaming process.
Usually, the water is either re-pumped as process water or channeled to the environment through a surface water treatment field, as authorised.
The bleeding rate was estimated to be approximately 300 cubic metres per hour when it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of the leak water meets the current permit conditions.
That's all the stuff that went into the environment.
The leak was detected during the check-up tour on Monday morning.
The leak has not been observed to cause structural damage to the tank’s dam structures.
The company reports that it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs around six hundred permanent workers.
Dansken Kuopämäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
The country report published by the IMF today follows largely the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation complained about structural reforms covering Finland in order to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime and paid holidays would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed in the whole contract system and in the area of unemployment security.
According to Danske Bank’s main economist Pasi Kuopämäe, structural reforms are agreed, but there are minor differences.
The IMF estimates that there is a great deal of cooperative message for government activities, but on the other hand there are warnings about what should not be cut too much.
These include, for example, infrastructure investments, Kuopamäki says to the economy.
In the view of the IMF, growth projects should also be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
This year, the IMF forecasts a 0.4% growth rate for Finland, which will rise to 0.9% next year.
Danske expects growth to remain at zero this year in his new business forecast.
The IMF is a little more optimistic about this year.
They may have had the most recent findings.
This morning Statistics Finland reported a slight increase in total output in the summer, Kuopämäki says.
Less attention has been paid to industrial confidence or to other so-called softer measures.
However, the differences are only a few per cent.
The dying Nintendo appointed a new leader
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satuori Iwata who died of cancer in July, started her work on Wednesday, said Nintendo on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo from 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face in the game industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for launching a successful Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to track Iwata's footprints, assessed by Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima’s task is to bring Nintendo into mobile games strongly, but it does not eat the company’s bread on the side of traditional gaming consoles.
More and more underage asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service recognised that hundreds of children who have come to the country will disappear annually.
This has been reported, among other things, by SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter on their website, according to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of underage applicants disappear each year.
Juha Kannelmaa, Senior Inspector of the Finnish Immigration Service, explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is the same situation in Finland?
How many applicants disappear "under the country" per year?- In 2013, a total of 156 applications were made for asylum by a single minor.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, similar applications were made in 196 and 11 of them disappeared.
The reason for the disappearance may be that it is clear from the examination that the applicant is already registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of age there.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue handling the case in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for handling the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will be found later when they seek asylum from another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 decisions were taken on the grounds that the applicant was likely to have moved out of Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared in the last 123 years, he says.
Is there an increase?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum by a single minor.
There are no overall statistics available on missing minors this year, but the number of applicants for asylum is therefore known and has increased clearly, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons, he stresses.
What happens to those who have received the conversion decision?
Will they also be lost, for example, to the "dark labour market"?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, because the police are responsible for implementing the conversion decisions, and Kannelmaa stresses.
Minister of Home Affairs Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of undeclared migrants.
He's taken action.
At the EU Home Minister's meeting, Orpo spoke on refugee issues on Monday about practical measures to manage the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see pictures of the devices
Timo T.A., a pioneer in the field of media, who lost his working capacity due to the incident, is now on the market.
Mikkonen's spouse, Nina Mikkonen, sells Huuto.net equipment that used to be the most advanced professional tools in their field.
The online announcement was the first to be reported by the web magazine to the Iltamakasi.
Today, much of the equipment has remained on the feet of technological progress.
In the digital media world, television programs are no longer filmed on Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that there will be people interested.
Of course, the equipment is no longer that up-to-date, but it is also necessary as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitised.
On the other hand, there are a lot of amateurs - collectors and designers of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen is thinking about IS.
The reason for the sale is that the Mikkos are trying to move away from their present stormylä home.
There's no way we can take all the stuff with us.
I've started to invent and see where the goods are being disposed of.
This is where I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There's no more use for TV and radio.
It is clear from recent strokes that a man who has a long career will no longer return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are being sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen's real life work was already archived in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic threatens to drill worse than it thought: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
Today, the drivers of the metro and trams will decide whether they will expand their efforts in connection with the Friday demonstration.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram traffic only during the demonstration on Friday.
In the afternoon, it will be solved if traffic stops all day.
Chief Agent Pekka Hirvonen says that the threat is great in the field.
The night and daytime cuts are arraigning drivers, so the government plans to cut the supplements generate resistance.
Hirvonen wonders, however, that stopping traffic all day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stop by Friday, public transport in the capital region is virtually completely stopped.
According to VR, trains do not travel between six and six o'clock on Friday.
On Friday, neither local traffic nor long-distance traffic will move.
Trains leaving before six o'clock are driven to designated stations.
According to HSL, most of the buses are left behind.
The ACP members are absent from work on Friday morning from 3 p.m. to Saturday morning at 3 p.m.
It is likely that a small number of buses can be driven, driven by a commanding force, and the HSL informant Pirko Repo is the one who thinks it is.
Repo says that HSL is unable to say exactly which bus shifts are due on Friday.
Wage and salary organisations organise a big demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Centre between 11 and 13 a.m. on Friday.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place at the Hungarian-Serbia border, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, reports the news agency AP.
According to Sky News, refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, escaped under panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water guns against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested in a school in Texas. The teacher thought it was a bomb.
In Texas, Texas, a 14-year-old Ahmed Mohammed has been arrested since the teacher considered the selfish watch he brought to school as a bomb.
Mohammed told Dallas Morning News that he only wanted to introduce his electronics performance.
But one of the teachers thought the watch looked like a bomb.
The police were called in, and the situation finally ended with the boy being taken to a youth detention cell in the cuffs.
At no point has it been found that Mohammed claimed that nothing other than that he had made the watch.
However, it is still possible that the boy will be accused of making a false bomb.
According to Mohammed, the police said the watch looked like a film bomb.
The watch is in the custody of the police, but it was known to be made up of a circuit board and a digital display between which there were wires.
The case happened last Monday, and Mohammed was punished for three days on forced leave from school.
His father is furious about the case and the Islamic Council of the country wonders whether the case is another manifestation of Islam phobia in the United States.
Britannia Koskus - Director Labour refused to sing a national song
The song calls on God to protect the Queen, but Corby is an adversary to the Monarchy.
The criticism put forward by the press, which is going to be higher than the right, has also been accompanied by the representatives of Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has offended the people, thought the Labour People's Representative Kate Green in a radio interview with BBC.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday’s memorial ceremony respected the British Air Force pilots’ battle against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corbyn in its official opinion and stresses his respect for the pilots by taking part in the event.
We all owe enormous gratitude to the heroism of the pilots of the Royal Air Force.
He (Corbyn) spoke with respect during the national song, stressed the opinion.
Corbyn's choice of party leader has divided the ranks of the Labour.
In particular, there are those who fear that he will banish moderate voters with his radical views.
Mr Corby is in favour of unilateral disarmament, the abolition of savings and the increase in public spending.
For the first time today, Mr Corbyn is due to appear as a party leader in Parliament at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Mr Corbyn has asked the public to make suggestions on what should be asked of Prime Minister David Cameron.
During the weekend, Cameron picked up Corbyn's election as a party leader on Twitter.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, our financial security and the security of our families, and the Prime Minister's advice in his own account.
The reason for the family death in Minnesota is still unclear. The family's father was waiting for the case.
The South Lake Minnesota police have been investigating family death in Greenwood in Minnesota for a week.
The family of five was found dead in their home on September 10th, and a few days later, the police confirmed that the shooter was the family's father, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After the first shooting with a shotgun, his wife and three of her children, Brian Short, killed themselves in the garage of the house.
Dead for days
The family was found after worried about the absence of children at school.
According to this report, the police went to the house to visit and found the short family dead across a huge house.
According to Star Tribune, it's possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Millions of houses and a successful company
The investigation into the case of Michael Sitar, chief of police, South Lake Mintonka, is still ongoing.
The motive for blood work is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property for nurses on the social media site AllNurses.com.
In 2014, at StarTribune interview Short reported that there were four million different visitors per week on the site.
I have received 50 offers of the company over the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
The success was seen, among other things, in the fact that in 2011, the Short Family bought a crazy house in Greenwood for $2 million.
The house is advertised in Zillow as a car collector’s dream: there are not only 12 rooms in the house, but also a garage sufficient for eight cars.
Court case pending
According to Star Tribune, however, the family's father was awaiting a legal case.
Achieve Test Prep, offering various pre-school courses, had sued him for his comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, short-term comments had not been removed from the site and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
According to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on Short's business.
Vesku Lair offered you cake coffees
In addition, the three owners were awarded at the therapeutic event with the Finnish hippos monthly horse-ownership prize.
This is great, Loiris commented in a good mood on his honorary chart.
The festive Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100 000 euros.
The artist legend Loiri was still confused by the success of Fabrice Duo in the grand contest.
I still don't think it's happened.
The success horse coach Korpi says that Loir will have full employment while working with the horse.
Pekka orders and decides where the horse is taken to compete.
And I keep my mouth shut, Loiri laughed.
The wonderful gesture of the NHL star "The Greatest Donation ever made by a sportsman"
The Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million (about 6.7 million) to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the hospital press, this is the biggest individual donation ever made by a sportsman to charity in Canada.
In addition, a 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital with other financial resources for the next seven years.
Subban and the Canadiens made an eight-year-old deal worth $72 million a year ago.
Subban’s donation amount is therefore significantly higher than his annual contribution of $9 million.
For the award of his donation, Subban will receive a lobby holding his name from the hospital.
The Canadiens players have before significantly helped local hospitals.
A year ago, long-term Captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a giant sum of money for another city's grand hospital, which provided the hospital with a PET scanner for cancer studies.
You can order a wife tonight from a Japanese coffee shop, serve only bikinis and an Essu on top of a meal.
The theme cafes are tough in Japan.
The markets already have goat coffee, cane coffee, vampire coffee, fish coffee and now wife coffee.
It strikes the lonely, the depressed, and the hungry.
Metro's on the news.
You can order yourself a wife or husband for the evening from the Tokyo Ore no Yome (Finland wife).
It's a waiter who pretends to be a client's spouse.
Half is selected from the list before coming to the cafe and he prepares and serves food.
The wife is facing only the Essu and the bikinis on her head, while the husband is in tight bikes.
The website offers the wife to apply for all information about length and pressure, always on the type of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
As soon as 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network, the attack on security of cars began to take place
The Automatic Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological developments and innovations in the sector, reports Intel’s press release.
It is composed of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of best practice in cybersecurity.
The company will update the report on the basis of ASRB's research results.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consultancy company, estimates that by 2020 some 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75 per cent of these vehicles can consume, create and share online data.
We can and must improve the cyber safety of cars, says Chris Young, Director of Intel Security.
With the help of ASRB, Intel can establish the best safety practices and support the view that cybersecurity is an important component in the design of every car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in data processing.
Ford Focus RS costs approximately 52 000 euros in Finland!
The Fordin Focus RS model has been expected for years as a rising moon.
Finally, the car begins to appear in Finland.
Ford released RS data now that the car world looks at Frankfurt's car show.
Ford's new four-wheeled RS speeds up by 2.3-litre, 350-hp engine in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and has a peak speed of 266 kilometers per hour.
The price is also interesting for Finland, it is provisionally reported to be 52 000 euros.
The car is already available, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford does not report.
The favourite sign, Kia, presented two new news at the Frankfurt Car Exhibition - this is the new Sportage and Optima
A new fourth-generation Sportage is certainly more important than two new ones by Finnish nationals, with Kia going to catch a bigger wing of the ever-growing street SUV market.
The new European design director, Gregory Guillaume, is more circular than before.
The axle and the outer dimensions have come in one cents here and the car is breaking up more efficiently.
The engine range is essentially unchanged, but it has been added to it by 177 horsepower-enhancing 1.6-litre turbo.
More Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported closer to sales.
We're going to have to wait a little longer, because we have a new Sportage coming in in spring 2016.
Even before the change of year, new Kia Optimat arrived in our country.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a whole new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of higher middle-class buyers with better driving features, lower noise levels and higher-level equipment.
Optimise with 1,7 litres of turbodiesel and 2,0 litres of petrol engine is obtained from the start.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate when the Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbo engine arrives next to them.
At the same time, the Optima farmer will start selling.
The Chisu returned to the stage in a brave blizzard.
Singer Chisu is involved in the Life for Children concert with other domestic stars.
There's an electric blue pantsuit with an open neck opening.
The outfit is a beautiful show of Siro's belt, the singer's star.
The whole is crowned with a golden metal belt and a red lipstick.
During a three - year break, a singer who has become a mother has received several pounds of punishment with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to end a year.
The singer published his first single album in August.
Going back to the stage and facing the public after a long break is not really exciting for me.
I've missed everything I've done about music, the singer tells me.
In a few weeks' time, Chisu will release his new album called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired the creation of new songs.
At this point, you're wondering if people are gonna find my new album, Chisu is thinking.
Kim Kardashian's motherhood makes me startling again. Now I see her chest.
A true-tv beautiful Kim Kardashian gives a number of topics after each other.
She's showing her pregnant stomach and bras freely in sexy clothes, last night at 1:00 in American time, when she and her sister, Kourtney Kardashian, left Kanye West, a husband.
Black maternity dress is transparent to the breasts.
It reveals the skin-colored bras under the dress when the lights are flashed.
Last time, Kardashian was dressed for a matrimonial maternity dress when he visited his friend for a dinner party in New York only a few days ago.
The costume was highlighted by black over-generation boots.
The third special maternity dress is as fresh as last week’s Friday, when the presentation was carried out on pregnancy.
The hard laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, the competition is terrible
The top model of Manon Leloup wanted to take a shortcut to the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary on the Speaking Dolls (Speaking Dolls) where Leloup and his colleagues talk their mouths about the model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine gathered six hard truth behind the scenes in Leloup.
Every season starts with nothing.
In the previous period, even if you had posed as top designers in costumes, the new season will begin again in castings.
And every season comes with new, fresh faces that compete with the pastors for work.
The models rarely have a place to call home.
The work is a continuous trip and can go for one year with a hotel room or apartment in which fashion houses house their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel along with you, loneliness can be untenablely difficult.
New York and Paris are the desired jobs, but they are the most stressful.
There's not just one sort of weight loss.
Agent New York may be asking for the pounds dropped, but in Paris they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is always a risk game.
In fashion weeks, models and designers are together all the time and act as a support network.
When fashion weeks are over, it's a bad difference.
The models want this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but the fact that everyone thinks that the job is just a presentation of clothes.
They want to be their own people, too.
The work makes the models feel that they are actors who have some role to play.
But you can also express yourself in the work of the model.
You modeled yesterday at Tory Burch's show.
In New York, fashion weeks are currently being celebrated, where planners will reveal their collections next year.
Roope Salminen, who changed his style, plays the most unknown Auxiliary Musician in the film
Roope Salminen performs Antti Lautala, the founding member of the band, in a film based on the early years of the Abilanta Association.
Lautala founded Apulanda in 1991 with Toni Wirtasen, but resigned from the band in 1994.
Well, it's a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm a rap artist almost 26 years old, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I didn't want to meet the real Ant before the shoots, because I wanted to make him my own interpretation.
The talent is clearly unknown to people from that group, so I think it's perfectly good that I only learn his play style from the video.
I don't want to imitate a human being.
A man who shoots Roope Salminen and the Dogs don't go into the role.
The punk manners come naturally, according to the man.
In the punk period of the starry, starry and star programme, many people must have seen the first taste, as well as if they've ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything small, but we always go full-time.
The main actors of Tuukka Temose, who played the bass between 1993 and 2004, were published today.
A group of young actors who have become known to the audience are still quite unknown to the general public.
Rumbal Sipe Santapukki is performed by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtasta Tatu Bluesalo bassist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a tip about her future laundromat yesterday night when she mysteriously told Snapchat that she was preparing for the most important day of her career.
Roope has already published yesterday in Instagram a picture of his new character, which he has had to do for the film.
Roope, previously seen in mustaches and jaws, has shaved his face into silos and dyed his brown hair into black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
Many parents have had to wonder in recent days how to tell the child about the situation of refugees seeking Europe.
Or is it worth telling you at all?
There is no need to speak out forcefully, a member of the SPR crisis group, counseled by psychologist Ferdinand Garoff.
It is worth protecting younger children, for example, not letting them watch the news alone.
Little children are not always able to understand what they saw, and it can remain in mind and distress, he says.
However, if a child has encountered or heard from refugees on television news photos, it is worth mentioning.
It is good to have a discussion about the child’s starting point and listen carefully to what he asks.
The fear of a child may be surprising.
They may not be the ones the parent thinks he is afraid of.
A child should not be intimidated for nothing, even if he is harassed and frightened.
A younger child closely monitors the conduct of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child also feels safe.
Larger children are likely to run into conversation about refugees in school, with friends or online.
It is good for parents to speak with them if you think about the child.
The fact is, not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents and their children can reflect on our family’s view of this.
However, do we think that the world is, after all, a safe or secure place?
Parents may also have different aspects of education - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as much as possible.
On the other hand, if family talk about difficult things, the child will have a model of how to deal with the challenges facing life.
This could be useful to him in the future.

You're out of your powers?
You can still be a good parent to your child
It's hard to control a blood attack on Pallosalamaa
Perttu Pohjola got sanded into the abyss of Apila Pallosalama in the middle of the summer.
It only worked on the profits and the number two lines until, at the end of July, there was a collapse in the raves of Tampere.
Since the slave was completely clogged, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered a period of protection from the veterinarian.
The explanation for the exit was found in the sight.
The horse had an infection of the throat.
The disease was not the slightest in the head, but it took two courses of medicine to break it down.
Since Apila Pallosalama had to exercise lightly, Pohjola says she was positively surprised by the horse’s last run.
It was in Turku on record time after the second SE-tama Taruntule.
Apilan Pallosalama was under very pressure from a break when it could normally only be driven for a few weeks.
In view of those things, the slight tendency at the end was understandable, says Pohjola.
The coach assumes that a fair race made the slave sharp.
The horse’s vigor certainly moved on from it, and I hope that it would have evened up.
Apila Pallosalama has been so-called humorous horses.
When it hasn't been fun, it's been able to throw fat without sickness.
On a good day, however, the slave has been torn off by a lightning sign that the opponents have been astonished.
At high speed, rivals cannot cope with Pallosalamaa, from which even warm-blooded rides can be removed.
Pohjola's hopes include a fine run in Vermo.
However, the different thing is how Apilan Pallosalama agrees.
It's kind of hard at the time of departure, and it might stick under the boom of the starter car and that kind of thing.
I hope the slave is more calm than Turu's leaving.
As Apila Pallosalama is in good condition, she can also come from the front, and we're going to drive it out of the win, Coach.
That's why you can't get rid of your iPhone programs.
Apple's CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the software that comes with Apple's iPhone phones may sometimes be removed in the future - but not all of them.
Apple will possibly remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, says the CEO of the company Tim Cook Buzzfeed at an interview.
Apple's iPhone contains a number of programs that are relatively rare to use: for example FaceTime calls, Journalism, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which came as a forced upgrade to iPhone phones, although it is necessary only for Apple's smart watch owners.
Cook says that the removal of Apple's programs is more complicated than it looks.
Some applications are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which iPhone Apple applications work closely with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
So, according to Cook, Apple is investigating this, because the company doesn't want to waste memory space on users' iPhone phones.
Euro area inflation fell to 0.1 per cent in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly in August, i.e. 0.1% year-on-year, while Eurostat reported today by the EU Statistical Authority.
The rise in prices was driven downwards by the decline in energy prices.
Thus, from a few weeks ago, Eurostat revised the 0.2% forecast slightly downwards.
In July the rate of inflation was 0.2 per cent.
The so-called bottom inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's forecast for base inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2 per cent cheaper last month than one year ago.
In the EU-wide, the average inflation rate was zero in August.
In July, the rise was 0.1 per cent.
Consumer prices rose most in the euro area, i.e. by 1.4 per cent in Malta in August.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest as prices fell by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent negative according to the EU's harmonised index.
Euro area inflation remains a long way from the European Central Bank's (ECB) objective, which is a two-percent increase in prices in the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year, the rise will rise to 1.1 per cent, the central bank forecast in its new inflation forecasts announced at the beginning of September.
The United States of America's next attempt to tighten up monetary policy
The U.S.’s next recession will begin at its fastest in less than a year, but more definitely within three years of Fed’s entering again for a long time to raise interest rates.
And in financial markets, the recession begins before the next recession.
Fed has pointed out that he will be starting the withdrawals, possibly already this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession can hit it as fast as possible by next autumn and as a gearbox on the financial markets before then.
Or at least this happens if the world's largest economy and financial markets operate as they used to be, and if they react to the tightening of Fed's money as they've done before.
Such conclusions have come to the conclusion of the German bank Deutsche Bank’s London market research strategy for Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in its extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed over 60 pages of the Long-Term Asset Return Study to its international clients last week.
The strategies drawn up by the study and the report do not believe they know when exactly Fed will start raising interest rates or what will happen in the economy and in the market.
Instead, they use the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics to show how the economy and the market have behaved in the past at and after Fed's interest payments.
In addition to historical observations, they will consider which key variables in the economic and financial markets are now on the same or different model as at the time of previous interest payments - and what might be the result.
It goes without saying that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more perverse state to withstand the rise in interest rates than they were before in the 1950s.
The beginning of the recession may not be a year.
The leaders who decided on Fed's monetary policy and its current impetus have, along the course of last summer and the early autumn, suggested that the time has begun to mature to raise interest rates.
The first raise for more than nine years can take place this week.
This will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Board of the Fed will meet to decide on this matter at its two-day meeting.
The last time Fed raised his so-called Fed funds steering interest in June 2006.
At that time, the relatively regular, but at a time small, interest-rate series of 0.25 percentage points, which led Fed to raise its interest rate from 1.25% to 5.25%, ended for just two years.
The financial market symptom began in 2007 with the difficulties of the most risky housing financing in the United States, and one year later the financial crisis broke the world's day of judgment into a nightmare.
The great recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, serious difficulties in the financial markets and the real economy began at a slower pace than previous Fed interest payments have typically taken place.
Similarly, the trials were more severe and bad than ever since the recession in the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategies have screened the rises and declines in the world's largest economies, as well as the turn of financial markets since 1950 and, in some places, since the beginning of the 19th century.
From the 1950s onwards, they will report on Fed's interest payments and their financial and financial impact.
It has taken less than one year, mostly less than three years and on average less than three and a half years, to start the recession at its earliest interest rate.
The increase in the exchange rate on the financial market has been completed within two years of the start of the FED interest payments.
Fed has in turn raised and in turn lowered its steering rate since the beginning of the 1950s for a dozen different cycles.
Each time is different from the other in some respects and there is a relatively limited number of times, so it is unlikely that any conclusions can be drawn on the impact of subsequent interest payments.
The strategies therefore remind us that this time many things are different.
And not just better.
The interest rates are too low for too long
While the underlying causes of the financial crisis may not necessarily be found out beyond doubt, even through decades of research.
However, for the three reasons that led the crisis and for the reasons that led it to increase its destructive power, I think it is somewhat undisputed that:
1) Fed, the ECB of the euro area and the other major central banks in the world in the 21st century considered their interest rates too low for too long.
They located the tracks of the technogram, and they also raised the next one.
2) Over the decades, the accumulated volume of debt in the various parts of the financial and real economy, and in the past, increased even more as a result of the central bank's over-exploitation of monetary policy.
The largest debt bubble in economic history so far was born.
3) In particular, the craziest debt financing packaged in the financial economy, which has been the most fragile, increased the largest currency bubbles in the economic history of most sectors of the financial markets since then, from shares to real estate, debt books and commodities.
It is unlikely that it is very severe to argue that the financial market, which has risen from ever more complex debt peaks, was in a rarely dangerous and unstable state when Fed and the other central banks last driven the interest rates upwards.
The fiscal structures imposed on debt banks did not last until after interest payments had started and the cost of debt financing had risen.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis, followed by a major recession.
Bigger bubble and more debt
Deutsche's strategies do not guess what will happen next, but they give the subject of nuance by mentioning, for example:
1) Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy going even further than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even further lower.
2) The debt has not been bad for a long time as it was ten years ago; it is now literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the debt burden on the financial and real economy has not been reduced, but now, in various parts of the economy, debt is much more severe than before or before the financial crisis.
3) Liquidity that has been issued at a lower and lower rate than before or at any time prior to the financial crisis has largely remained in the financial market and has slowed down the most important types of securities and assets.
In addition, the strategies do not only have the warning signs on the financial markets but also point out that even the US economy has not recovered from the financial crisis and from the most severe recession in decades to the model that has taken place in the past.
The euro area economy has barely recovered.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state but, accordingly, the pressures and risks on the financial markets are incomparably higher than before the financial crisis when Fed next starts to tighten up his money supply.
Perhaps the picture of the future of Albert Edwards, the French bank Societe Generale, is not as strange as it may suddenly be.
He's been coaching the bank's international investors customers for a long time for the following full translations of Fed:
First Fed raise interest rates, then the financial bubbles break out, and soon it'll be time for Fed to turn off the financial pieces with even bigger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) which manufactures computers and printers will reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are directed to HP's business service provider, the company reports.
In November, HP is divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., which focuses on printing machines and printers for consumers.
HP’s workforce peaked in 2011 when it had 350000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302000.
The company will record one-off costs of USD 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise reduces 20,000-30,000 employees.
The reduction of the consumer side will remain at 3300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its activities to low cost countries with 60% of its employees in low cost countries in 2018.
The company reports that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers are responsible for more than 10% of its operating result.
In the second year, its three most significant customers accounted for 65 per cent of the operating result.
iOS 9: How to get a new operating system after the iPhone Apple update
You can request a new operating system by going to the Settings application, clicking "General" and then selecting "Programme Update".
If the update is ready, the phone will allow you to download it and then install it.
Some people have had problems since this installation when a "software update failed" error has appeared on the screen.
To overcome this, users are recommended either to wait for the worst traffic to pass or to try to update via iTunes.
The phone guides the user in the end process.
This may include removing applications for space, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the update and also facilitating the process with a new tool that proposes to remove applications and then reinstall them when the update is completed.
You should make sure that your phone is loaded or the charger is near you during the update so that the battery does not end.
If the download level is too low, Apple will not allow the update to proceed, as if the battery is in the middle, it can lead to a breach of the update.

It is also worth ensuring that you have gone through our list of all the things you need to do before charging so that things don't go wrong, and how you can protect yourself from it if they go. iOS 9 brings with it new features such as a much smarter personal assistant and a hugely new productivity feature for iPad, as well as improvements that speed up and repair the operating system.
YLE: Minister Berner has been acting in the Board of Tax havens
According to Ylen, Minister of Transport and Communications, Anne Berner (Central) has been a member of the Board of Directors of the Tax haven Company.
According to Ylen, the company was involved in so-called tax planning.
It is a Luxembourg company called Saltri II LuxCo, which was appointed as a member of the Board of Directors in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Board of Directors.
Berner himself says he filed a notice of resignation in May of this year.
I checked it out, and it's enough that I've filed a divorce notice.
It is almost impossible to manage and control the fact that the registration chains take place within the agreed timetable, says Berner at the interview.
Membership after merger
The Luxembourg company manages the ownership of the Swedish company Kährs.
Kährs is a park manufacturer who fused with the Finnish park manufacturer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner worked for the Karelia-Upoflor Government in 2010-2013 and after the merger with the Kährs Government and the Luxembourg company.
According to the above, the ownership of Kährs in Luxembourg is through a multi-ported ownership structure.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted a government membership at the Luxemburg company at the request of the second largest owner of Kährs.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been involved in the administration of the Hartwall Capital, the Karelia-Upoflor.
The company was contacted for a partner that was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a venture capitalist with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to ensure that the capital interests of the Finnish family company were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the income of our Finnish companies' capital is taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this connection, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's ownership in the company does not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up on the tax haven is due to the fact that Triton, the largest owner of Kährs, had already had a capital fund ready for ownership by Luxembourg holding company.
Espoo opens a reception centre operated by the company
The first reception centre maintained by the company will be opened in Otaniemi, Espoo, for adults seeking asylum.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants from 6 p.m. today.
The number of seats can increase to up to 300-400 people in a week.
The Finnish Immigration Service will set up a reception centre in the property of the former Rescue Institute.
The operation is maintained by Luona Oy, which is specifically responsible for the provision of health care and medical care services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy agree, among other things, on the security arrangements of the Centre.
STC is preparing an alternative work-life tightening package
The St.T.C.C. is preparing an alternative package for the government's tightening up of working life.
The organisation also wishes to see other employees' centres organisations.
According to President Palola, attention is currently being paid to Friday's demonstration.
Alternative means of reducing the price of work will then return.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola pointed out that the organization’s administrative meeting would take a break from the reporters.
On the other hand, Palola believes that the Central Business Union (EC) is not ready for discussions.
The economyists of the STSK have calculated that the change security contained in the Government's competitiveness package costs the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, while the other half of the package is EUR 2 700 million.
I don't know if it's such a big deal of enthusiasm for the party to have a conversation if it's on the side of one relationship to a hundred.
Palola: The negotiating relationship was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is due to submit a communication on its own package to Parliament and start preparing for the reforms.
Palola did not take a position on whether the timetable was realistic.
According to Palola, the connection to the government exists and it has always been constructive.
According to Palola, the staff centre association for the STK field is a painful place, especially for the Sunday supplements.
The organisation requires the government to withdraw from coercive legislation to implement part of the blackmail.
According to Palola, the STK does not allow the alternative package to be prepared with the SDP.
Employees meet on Friday in Helsinki to oppose the government's work-life blackmail package presented last week.
As part of the package, the salary of the first days of sickness is cut, the over-work benefits are reduced by half, the Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and the holidays are reduced.
The STC stresses that central organisations have invited employees to participate in demonstrations and that the aim has not been to arrange a strike.
Akavan Fjäder congratulates
The President-in-Office, Mr Fjäder, thanked the St.T.K.K.K.K.K. for the announcement of the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, the STK is now on the same lines with Akava, as there is an alternative model for government presentations in Akava.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, because without SAK the package is not sufficiently comprehensive.
Mr Fjäder, President-in-Office, hopes that SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will come along to prepare the proposal as an alternative to surgery.
Mr Palolan STK said earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, the plan announced that it had long prepared its own proposal to negotiate the 5% competitiveness leap sought by the government of the country as an alternative to the cuts.
The plan has been ready to negotiate all along, and we have long written an alternative model for government presentations.
We are ready to look at the terms of the employment relationship as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to the Akava line, as STTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together on a model that goes to the government and employers of the country, says Fjäder.
The Bureau will meet on Thursday at 15 a.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same boat, the same coal, the same balls" - play bingo while Sipilä speaks tonight
University of Tampere Green Left
Viva bingo coupon for the Green Left of the University of Tampere for the evening.
The Prime Ministers have previously made extraordinary statements during Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä will exceptionally speak to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on the Yle channel on Wednesday night at 21.05.
In order to apply for the previous Prime Minister's speech, it is necessary to go to 1932 when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister when he gave the famous radio speech, which marked the beginning of Mäntsälä's rebellion.
After that, the President and the ministers held several radio talks during the winter and post-war period.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the strike of train drivers on television.
Loneliness, Monarchist Meininks
Sipila's speech has raised criticisms and conjectures all day about what to expect.
On Twitter Paavo Arhinmäki, President of the Left Union, said that "Silä could give her speech on the state of the nation in the Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, allowing her to discuss the speech".
According to the Green Ville Ninistö, "one call has already been seen.
Leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
The SDP Erkki Judgments on Facebook condemned "monarchist ours: the Prime Minister will tell the people what is best for it".
Antti Rinne, President of the SDP, challenged Sipila's dialogue: "A long six months of elections.
Not a single performance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
We've tried.
What are you afraid of? @juhasipila?
Public service
According to the Prime Minister's Office, Sipila's speech has been recorded in advance and takes about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, it is commented directly on by SAK President Lauri Lyly and EC Managing Director Jyri Häkämies.
The high level of criticism of Sipila's speech.
We considered the issue and said that it was part of the public service mission to promote the entire public in Finland, and the director of Yle's publications in Ismo Silvo Yle's news.
It's like we're at Tammels' time.
The speech has also raised ridicules.
In the evening, dinner is enjoyed in good time, children are combed and dressed as their best.
My mom's gonna put on the nicest hole, and my dad's gonna fit the tie in his neck.
At nine o'clock, you'll be quieted down to the TV, like you used to do at the time of the Me Tammeloja," says bloggeri Saku Timonen.
"In his speech, Prime Minister Sipilä also tells us why millions of millionaires who hide their capital in tax havens are sitting in the Finnish government, who are drafting pardon laws for their other tax evasion buddies and, at the same time, claim to the people that it is necessary to cut when the government has run out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
As Sipilä says, one guess is presented by the University of Tampere Green Left Viva.
It's been published on Facebook by the bingo below.
Are we hearing about the same boat tonight, the same coal, living as debts, and the team spirit?
Coupons and pens ready, at 21.05 it begins and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: Western countries rejected Russia's proposal to set aside al-Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected Russia's offer by which the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would have given up power, reports President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian UN Ambassador proposed a plan whereby al-Assad would have left power elegantly after some time.
However, the Western countries did not take the proposal because they believed that Al-Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent member states of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurk listed to him in a two-sided debate a three-point plan: the opposition was not allowed to be armed, the opposition had to be reached immediately between the opposition and al-Assad, and the abandonment of Al-Assad had to be carried out with restraint.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree with all things, but we are able to discuss them openly.
I told him what I was doing there, and he said sit down, Alas, Martti, and I'll tell him what we need to do, and Ahtisaari will remember Guardian at the interview.
Diplomatics don't comment
The Ahtisaari reports that he passed Tshurkin's message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion, but Ahtisaari says there are no two words about it.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said that Al-Assad's troops had already committed several massacres at that time and the main opposition groups refused all the agreements by which he would have remained in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs's Middle East Department, takes the Ahtisaari's speeches into distrust because, according to his experience, Russia was at no point prepared to discuss the fate of Al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported Al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest part of Ahtisaari's argument is that Tshurkin spoke with the Moscow Council.
If he had told me about Tshurkin's speech, I would have said that I wanted to hear the same thing from President Putin so I could take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would have suspected that it would have been Putin's fight to hold the power of one of Al-Assad's supporters.
The refugee current for our own actions
During the negotiations in Ahtisaari, some 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
According to the UN estimates, the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the current year.
Over 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is what we do.
I see no alternative but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill we ourselves caused, says Ahtisaari.
Centre for asylum seekers with a sturdy tortoise
The Government’s Centre for Asylum Applicants in Northern Finland is likely to be established in Tornio.
The Centre would be set up in a building in the center of the city of the empty Tower Cooperative.
The Ministry of Interior has sought a suitable place to better control the refugee flow from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat announced on Tuesday that the council would have already decided to present the school building as a space solution for the Ministry.
According to the Vice-President of the City Council of Tornio, Sauli Höppinen (left), that is not true.
When the entire council was not assembled and some of the people wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite the council to decide on the matter next Monday, he will specify the STT.
There were 36 delegates out of 43 at the meeting.
The organisation centre was opposed by 13 delegates.
On that basis, you could expect the decision to be positive," says Eöppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday and the city responded quickly.
An estimated 500 asylum seekers would be available at a time.
The expert has been checking that it is suitable for such use.
The location is two hundred meters from the border, so it would work in that sense too, says Nousiainen.
Sipila still hopes for an alternative to blackmail in the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä, halving the public holiday money would only cover part of the government's aim of calculating the price of work.
However, the government is happy to accept an alternative package, if such an agreement can be reached by the social partners.
Sipilä told the journalists in the Parliament that she had not been in contact with the social partners.
He also did not know how seriously organisations were looking for remedies for the tightening of working life announced by the government.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's view, half of the allowances would be a means of dealing with almost all the employees, unlike, for example, the operation of Sunday supplements envisaged by the government.
The social partners could agree among themselves on the cut-off of holidays because they have been registered in collective agreements instead of the law.
On Wednesday next week, the government will report to the Parliament on the tightening of working life as a communication from the Government.
According to Sipila, the proposals made by the organisations should be known before this.
This is not the end of the line either.
The legislative work will then begin, which means that the train is on the move and will become more and more difficult.
It's a good time.
It won't take long for things like this, if there's a will, Sipila would.
The list published by the government last week includes, among other things, the conversion of the sloppy and the helatorist into unpaid leisure days without shortening the annual working hours.
In addition, the first days of sickness are reduced, the overtime is reduced to half, the Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and the holidays are reduced to 75%.
Reforms are being implemented as a coercive legislation over trade unions, which has raised strong criticism.
As a result of the activities, the Mem­ber Centres organise a major demonstration on Friday, and several trade unions have declared political strikes.
The Council of the Tohmajärvi approved the extension of the Jubilee's warehouse
The council of Tohmajärvi unanimously approved the extension of the Hall of Nordic Koivu Oy, or the juice hall warehouse, which is a bit of a nuisance.
The criticism was that the project was bigger and more expensive than the one originally mentioned.
Also, a busy schedule with heart.
It was also little wonder that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this stage, an extension of the stock by 400-450 sqm was approved for the investment programme but will be decided on at the time of the interim report.
While there was still a debate on investment of between EUR 150,000 and EUR 200 000 on the agenda, at the meeting, Mr Erkki Ikonen, technical director, said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
Investment was supported on the basis of the fact that it brings jobs and tax revenues to the locality.
The municipality does not have a risk, as the company pays for the investment as a rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) justified.
There's also a place for Karelian language in Joensuu
The city government reduced its previous steep position in order to bring street signposts in the Karola language to the city centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and is in the right light of the preservation of the herd’s tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu is not declared to be the capital city of the language of the herd because there are no historical grounds for it, and the language of the herd is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of the eastern Savon dialects.
Even after the new decision, there will be no street sign in the city center.
However, the City of Joensuu is also ready to use the cattle’s language on a case-by-case basis, for example, in the information boards and in the marketing of tourism.
The same attitude is recommended by the city to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a single-language municipality, it is also worth taking a generous view of the use of the cattle's language now that multiculturalism lives and changes strongly in North Karelia as well.
Karelian language is still a special feature of the county, as is the image of Joensuu as the whole forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can well be used to benefit from the multi-disciplinary marketing of the province.
The derailment of trains will cut the vitality of the province
Train connections are being hit by the region's vitality with a strong hand.
Transport links have a direct impact on the economic life and competitiveness of the region.
And that does affect whether or not we can live and work here, the Mayor of Joensuu Kari Karjalainen wonders.
He also highlights air transport, which has also been followed up on several occasions in the report.
It is important for the whole of the region that we do not have the potential to be able to cope with by means of state measures, as is now happening.
We should look at the impact of these transport connections on employment, for example, and Karjalainen stresses.
The deterioration of access leads to further challenges for the University of Eastern Finland regarding attractiveness.
Of course, the better services here are, such as traffic connections and housing situation, the easier it is to get students and employees, Jükka Mönkkönen, Principal of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor traffic connections also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travels a great deal because of the research.
Marko Junkkarinen, Recruitment Manager, says that marketing a university to Western Finland is already difficult because traffic links are weak across borders.
At present, about half of students at the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Finland.
Some 10-20 per cent of them are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by direct train connection.
The river mouth became one of the sound of the Siu
The opinion of the City Government of Joensuu on the national Siu Sote project is apparently unanimous, but one among the sound of the gravel is also one.
At the government's Monday meeting, Pentti Kessalo (sd., in the picture) presented the whole project to be abandoned, but his performance was ineligible.
The government approved the City Director Kari Karjalainen's draft resolution, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will give a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train from Kotta to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger train traffic from Kott to Kouvola will continue in the future, although one pair of trains less frequently.
Changes will be made to passenger trains between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One train shift is missed, but still five times a day is available from the Eagle to Kouvola and vice versa.
The reductions are due to state savings measures.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications’ purchase money for the next four years will fall to EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely terminated.
VR will prepare new timetables by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed to the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys snuck off the property.
The rescue facility let a 12-year - old climber on the roof from the climber, who did not get off the roof by himself.
The situation took place in Tornion Hill on Keto Road at 6 p.m. on Tuesday night.
There is an old two - story wooden house with no ladders to the roof.
It did not prevent a group of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mass of the radio amateurs next to it.
The other boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, others were sneaking away, and passers were alerting the rescue station to help the last one left safely on the roof of the earth.
FedEx's operating profit is doubled, decreasing the outlook for the tax year 2016
FedEx reports depressing results in the last quarter, and the delivery leave cut off its annual performance forecast, as a result of reduced demand for freight services and higher costs for ground services.
The company also said that it intends to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
This time last year FedEx announced that it is hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
Its share fell by about 2.5 per cent in the opening auction 45 minutes before Wednesday’s opening clock.
FedEx Corp. says that it expects the tax year to end next May to be 10.40-10.90, which is 20 cents below the previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10.84, let's just say the Fact Set survey.
In spite of the average price increases of 4,9 %, which will enter into force on 4 January, and despite the higher additional charges that started in November in the ground transport of heavy or large packages.
The company said it was expecting a growing operating profit from the previous year because they have cut costs, turnover has increased and online sales are growing.
The president and CEO, Fred Smith, said that the company "will be firmly carried out taking into account the weaker economic conditions expected, particularly in production and global trade."
The plans for salaries during the holiday were published on the day after the competitor UPS told us that he was going to hire 90-95,000 extra workers, about the same as it hired last year.
In the quarter ending on August 31st, FedEx's profit was $692 million, which is 6% more than last year.
The profit per share came to $2.42, which is left with an average estimate of $2.44.
Turnover increased by 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
In Zacks' survey, six analysts were expecting $12.23 billion.
In recent years FedEx has suffered from a reduction in international priority transport, which has stopped the development of the Express unit's turnover.
However, the rise in the online trade has improved FedEx Ground’s results.
In the last quarter, the land unit's turnover increased by 29 per cent, but in principle the revenues of operations were the same because of the high costs of larger packages and the insurance of its own.
The revenues of the Express Unit were higher due to higher basic charges, while the operating profit in freight operations was reduced by higher labour costs.
At the opening auction about an hour before the opening clock, FedEx’s shares fell to $3,85, or 2.5 percent to $1,15.
FedEx closed 11 per cent this year on Tuesday and 17 per cent less than the 11th of June record.
This week, the decision -makers of the U.S. Central Bank are sitting around a huge mahogany table long awaited to decide whether the time has come to raise the steering rate for the first time to almost a decade.
At the other end of the central bank's decorative, two-storey conference room is a wall painting from the United States.
The map is a reminder that Janet L. Yellen, President of the Central Bank, and her colleagues, must put the economic interests of the nation above all else.
The Congress has put two kinds of responsibility on the shoulders of the Central Bank: they must maximise the employment rate in the United States and keep prices stable.
However, since the great recession, the Governors of the Central Bank have agreed that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: economic stability.
It is precisely this third requirement that can be a decisive factor in the decision to be published on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot be predicted, and the decision whether the US economy is ready to be withdrawn from a record of an incentive that has led to almost zero short-term interest rates until the end of 2008 .
Although the majority of the data show that the economy is growing steadily, the recent recession in global financial markets can have already made pre-scrupulous central bank officials more scared, which will increase instability, and we fear that it would affect the federal funds rate by at least one percentage point.
"The labour market and inflation are clearly the first and most important factors to be followed," says Lindsey M. Piegza, the chief economic expert at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if they are looking for justification for remaining interest rates, the increased uncertainty in the world market is still valid enough," he says.
The decision of the central bank has not been agreed, which is already causing a nervousness in the economy.
According to a recent study by Bloomberg, about half of the financial experts predict an increase in interest rates this week.
On the other hand, the financial markets expect the central bank to delay the increase, as the key indicator indicates that the potential for growth is only around 30%.
This refers to a fall in the securities markets if the central bank increases the level if the decision-makers then fail to soften the impact by promising that the next increase will not take place in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index rose by 228.89 points, i.e. 1.4 per cent, with a new figure of 1659.85.
The recovery brought with it the expectation that the central bank will keep the level unchanged this week, says John Lonski, the main financial expert in Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It's surprising if the central bank raises interest rates right now," he says.
If the decision-makers raise interest rates, "they will have to make a lot of effort in their guidelines to support the financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts claim that the increased level would calm the financial markets because it would remove uncertainty as to when the central bank operates.
Only a month ago, it seemed that the central bank would be raising interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point this month, thus taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of the monetary situation, which would confirm the stability of the US recovery.
Yelle has said in the spring and early summer that she expects to rise this year, despite the fact that the liberals are calling for more economic development in their complaints.
Although the creation of new jobs slowed down in August, growth in the labour market has been stable this year.
Last month, the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent, which is the lowest in seven years and close to the level considered by the central bank to be the limit of full employment.
The increase in wages has shown signs of acceleration.
Although inflation remains below the central bank's 2 % annual target, the central bank's decision-makers believe that access to this is a temporary impact of a significantly lower oil price.
The economy, which is also clear from higher interest rates and also needs them taking into account the tight labour market situation, notes Ian Shepherdson, chief financial expert at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial markets around the world were shaken last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index decreased by up to 16 per cent of its May record when investors feared that China's slowing economy would also slow down global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now almost 10% below the peak of May.
For the decision-makers of the central bank, market confusion is an additional factor in a complex equation, which tells us that the interest rate should be increased.
"Without these financial market events and the news of recent weeks about China's economic weakness, decision-makers would tighten up the level at this meeting," says Stephen D. Oliner, a specialist researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former central bank official.
He now predicts that the decision-makers will wait at least a month to gain a better understanding of the effects.
"The possible effects on the US economy are still very unclear and they do not have much information at their disposal as to the consequences of Chinese events," Oliner says.
The well-being of the international economy is not the central bank's main concern, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Central Bank has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been enormous.
In 2013, Ben S. Bernanke, the then president, suggested that the central bank could "be able to reduce" the amount of money, caused upheavals in the market around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, central bank officials are expected not only to develop elsewhere but also to consult other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the world economy.
The decision-making process of the central bank is "more art than science", says Zachary Karbell, head of the global strategy of the asset management company Envestnet Inc.
In this month, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank (Federal Reserve Bank) of the state of Virginia, Richmond, pointed out that "the central bank has previously overreacted the financial market movement, which has seemed to be separate from the fundamentals of the economy."
The Federal Open Market Committee has called for an increase in interest rates, and Mr Lacker, a member entitled to vote, calls on the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The Asian economic crisis caused the central bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage points over three meetings "in spite of its limited, identifiable effects on US economic growth," says Lacker.
A year later, the central bank reversed these operations.
The central bank should give priority to economic stability only during the major crisis, such as the collapse of the market in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England.
The latest riot will not be close to its level, says Posen.
"No one wants to see a situation where there is fear of raising interest rates because the market gets upset", says Posen, Chairman of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a dual requirement and does not mention economic stability, and as long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.
Do you miss a great Thai store?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, in Chinatown.
This store/storage was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C, which is often referred to as Thai-Costcona, is a sham shop that also sells to private people.
Yeah, it's in Chinatown, not Thailand Town.
The store/storage is a single stop shop offering a stunning selection of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, kitchen needs, furniture, and religious and festive decorations.
There's even a car compartment in the store if you need motor oil.
The store is huge, and it takes more than an hour to go around all the corridors.
If you get hungry, you can eat at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen (good, cheap) inside the store is close to the cats, and there are several pick-up pipes.
What do you have in the warehouse, do you need anything from any Thai?
LAX-C probably sells it.
Products have been priced in a reasonable manner and a large part of the products are sold in wholesale packaging.
Recent products contain Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruits and other products.
The meat counter is large, the same fish counter. The staff cleans and fills the fish and, if necessary, cook it for you.
A large part of the movement is reserved for a huge freezer section where you can find frozen curry leaves, curry and gala, whole ducks, fish, beef and bile, pork skin, fish bulls, local sausages, meals and more.
Who goes to the store: Restaurant owners and cooks, but also individual families and individuals.
For those who use it, shopping carts and trucks are suitable.
Finding: Fresh monthong duriot next to the register.
Where is it: The store is in the Los Angeles factory district near Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area, which it divides with other shops and restaurants.
Although the shop may be busy, it is usually easy to find a parking space.
Brazil’s Children’s Disease Organization Rio Grande advertises a healthy diet for mammals
The Brazilian Children’s Disease Organization SPRS has invented a shocking way of trying to make women understand the importance of good food during breast - feeding by publishing images of babies sucking on breasts that have been photographed of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which provide babies with all the nutrients necessary for the development of a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that increasing calories is not the only dietary change that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Professor Robert Waterland at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas revealed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genetic expression of their babies and protects babies from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the child’s immune system.
Seven-channel Sunrise is a favorite viewer in numbers, despite Nine-channel attempts to news in the Today Show program
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson’s rush to Canberra to announce the after-mentioned references of the Liberal Party’s leader’s revelation failed to increase the number of viewers in today’s event.
The Nine Channel's morning program was sent from the capital of the country after Malcolm Turnbull took over Tony Abbott.
The competing program Sunrise, run by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of the weekly series of international broadcasts covering Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The distance to the printing works did not seem to harm Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise’s average TV viewer was 397 000 in five state capitals, while today’s figure was 339 000.
The average for today rose slightly from Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000) but was still lower than last Thursday (343 000).
Today has captured Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, the average for Today was 318 000 and Sunrise was 330 000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference ranged between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
For the time being, in September, Sunrise has an average of 349 000 viewers, with a number of 314 000 on Today.
This is the most interesting event this morning.
The changes are blowing away this morning, not in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
Published by TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
The great news of the Seven Channel was the 800-word series with the former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson, an amazing first performance.
The new drama series, which collected a quite impressive average of 1.219 million viewers, tells about a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with two children.
The critics have wondered if Thomson's popular series is alone without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave it real certainty.
The Seven Channel The X Factor program was a strong favorite with 1.136 million viewers, easily winning the The Block series (838 000) and the TBL Families series (726 000).
Seven channels had two kinds of fates on the second night of the The Chase Australia series.
The first half-hour (17-17.30) of Andrew O'Keefe’s new screening program gathered 446 000 viewers.
Another half-hour (17.30-18) rose to 623,000 viewers, which was enough for a small profit from Eddie McGuiren's Hot Seat programme (613 000).
On Monday evening, the first half-hourly viewer of The Chase Australia was 520,000 viewers, and the second half-hourly viewer was a peak of 720 000.
The average number of Hot Seats was 620,000.
The decrease in the second-night average in The Chase Australia gives Nine the confidence that Hot Seattle will eventually become the most popular program at 5.30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute program, which failed to reduce the number of viewers in the McGuire programme.

The three finals agree with the fathers that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
The secret has been revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski could accidentally reveal who won the Bachelor series.
The identity of the woman Sam Wood meets in The Bachelor.
The three remaining girls certainly don't slip who got the last rose.
However, when we discussed with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before the three became two, they could unintentionally give a hint of the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's finals.
All three women were poetic about how Wood is the perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, ambition, family dignity, and positivity as the reasons why they would want to be his partner.
However, when they were asked, "If the last rose of Wood is not for you, who is it supposed to go to?", their answers could offer a revelation of who won the bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Felows and Markoski quickly mentioned Mackay as the best option for Wood after themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been uncomplicated since day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house, (Sarah)'s energies and Sam's energies seemed quite compatible, and that thought was in my mind all the time", said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is really close, it's fun to be with him," Markoski added.
I've seen them together and there's chemistry between them.
They seem to be comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would make a good match.
Mackay said last week's house visits made him realize that Wood could be the one.
"When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game," he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say," he said.
I like the remaining girls just as much, so it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be sent on Wednesday at 7.30 p.m. on the Ten Channel.

Jarryd Hayne has many options where to start her NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both quite interested in him since he moved to the United States, and many other teams have asked him about him after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers team as well as Coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some trainers would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game, after this Australian rubby league reverse dropped the ball in the first round when the team won the Minnesota on Tuesday, reading 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and let Haynen return the next flight and took him into the running game after Reggie Bush was injured.
The real nature of Tomsula also appeared in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of calling his new arrivals a Battalion in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at the post-game press conference.
49erss Special Editor Cam Inman reported that Haynea was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped the flight hit by Minnesota Vikings on the first quarter of the game.
This was certainly not the beginning Hayne and her numerous Australian fans wished for the man's NFL debytes.
Haynen was seen as a curse on the way from the field after the fall, and later he told the Australian radio lighter Hamish & Andy about the 2DayFM channel at 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start for his NFL career.
"It was just one of these things now, you just have to think about the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared her bearding to her 2007 Original debut, when the feed in her own paint area led to the Queensland goal.
All in all, it was still a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posted on her Instagram account in a photograph with fans, holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights.
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Hodorkovski, was arrested with a gun threatening the Siberian runway.
Hodorkovski had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was sentenced, his oil company Yukos was seized and his efforts to support democracy were restricted.
4 died while the police shot rubber bullets against protestors in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old son, died in southern Nepal, in a police-shot rubber bullet force, which showed a sense of the country's new draft constitution, the authorities reported on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh region about 175 miles west of the capital Katmandus.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the top official in the area, said that more than 1,000 protestors had gathered outside the police station, and some of them threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal said that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty cops and five civilians were injured, he told us.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, known to have killed, but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, appeared to have caused so many deaths.
In the recent weeks of violent demonstrations, the meeting was throughout Nepal, where members of the ethnic group Madhesi say that the new provinces established under the proposed new constitution undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in Western Nepal when the Tharus Group is calling for its own country.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have died in violent conflicts, 11 of which have been police officers.
At that time, four main parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but it is a very controversial matter in Nepal, which has had a central government for centuries.
The new Constitution has been planned since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process since the devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
This week, the legislators have voted on the constitutional draft clauses for Katmandus, and the authorities have said that the new Charter has been adopted by Sunday.
The National Hurricane Center of the United States NHC says that south of Cape Verde there is a 60% chance of a hurricane storm.
On the wide front of the low pressure, which is about 560 km south of the southernmost part of the Cape Verden island group, 60% of the chance to develop into a tropical hurricane in the next 48 hours, the National Hurricane Center of the United States reported on Tuesday.
The second observable low-pressure front, located in the middle of the Cape Verden island group and in the middle of the Little Antiques, also has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical hurricane in the next two days, the Miami weather forecasting centre increased.
Google launches a donation campaign aimed at collecting 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O.) published a donation campaign aimed at collecting 11 million dollars for humanitarian organisations that help thousands of refugees who came to Europe in their escape from the tear of war and from impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptional personal perspective when it published its donation campaign in its blog.
Instead of reporting as a leader, Google’s employee Rita Masoud wrote about his personal experience, who fled Kabul when he was seven years old with his family.
"We were traveling with a number of dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, coldness and darkness," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But once the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family desperately want to help.
Donations receive four non-profit organisations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that it corresponds to each donation made on Google.com/refugeerieef worldwide up to $5.5 million, with a total target of $11 million.
Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, and it is mainly due to the four years of civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people from its homes this year.
Many also flee from war - ravaged Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery can help mildly obese diabetics
According to the new study, the benefits of weight loss surgery in patients with mildly obese type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics live longer after weight loss surgery than those treated in other ways than surgery.
"It takes a long time to get death data," Dr. Robin Blackstone says.
In weight reduction or bariatric surgery, different methods are used to reduce the size of the abdominal column.
They reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the subjects in the study have been sickly fat and their body mass index (BMI) has been 35 or more.
BMI, i.e. the weight ratio to length, is considered normal when it is between 18,5 and 24,9.
If BMI is more than 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if a BMI is over 30, it is considered to be obese.
You can count your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery, and stomach reduction, medication for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year decreased from 31 to 24.5.
At the same time, those who were treated with other means than surgery remained largely the same in 29 C.E.
36% of the subjects who were cut had a total and 28% improvement in their diabetes.
In comparison, in the medicated group, the overall improvement in diabetes was only 1% and partly approximately 2%.
In addition, the blood pressure, triglycerides and the "bad" LDL-C" were generally better in the surgical group, the writers said.
Patients were also monitored for haemoglobin levels of A1c, which reflect long-term blood sugar levels.
Haemoglobin A1c should remain below 7 %, with researchers writing.
After surgery, haemoglobin A1c decreased from approximately 9% to around 6%.
However, it remained stable in approximately 8% of patients treated with medicinal products.
However, this better "glycemic control", as described by improved levels of haemoglobin A1c, did not reduce mortality in five years, reports the chief investigator, Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The study group also compared the average results between two different types of surgery.
At the fifth year, when compared with the group in the stomach surgery, the group in the stomach bypass surgery had lost more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), decreased their body weight index by more (7.4 and 5.1), decreased haemoglobin to greater than A1c levels (3.1% and 2.1%), and was more likely to achieve complete diabetes remission (46.9% and 16.7%).
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix's Blackstone says that although research does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are research results in Sweden, where surgery led to longer life for more powerful people.
The Swedish study found that obesity patients undergoing weight loss surgery had a 29% lower probability of death in the 15-year period compared with a group that had tried more conventional treatments.
Although a new study does not appear to improve the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says that the results are nevertheless encouraging for those with a BMI below 35 and who are interested in the surgery.
"The research results are crucial in demonstrating that surgery is safe for the lower body weight index group" and do not involve an increased risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should be taken very seriously when BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we'll wait too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that once a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to cancel the situation.
"Everything can't come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that a real solution to the current refugee crisis can be found in the Middle East.
The head of the Tibetan Buddhism has called for the end of violence in the refugees' countries.
The Dalai Lama discussed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of his ten-day British visit to the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion, Oxford.
The Dalai Lama claimed that in the present situation all mankind’s needs should be put before individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that although the Western European countries' response to the refugee crisis must be admirable, it is also inadequate.
"Everything can't come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts in the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of a number of thousands of refugees, but in the meantime we must think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real progress to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The ultimate thing is to think about how we can reduce the number of killings in their countries.
We need to reduce our power.
Power use has never solved these problems," he added.
In taking a position on the issue of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the US's violent response caused violent chain events.
"After the sitting on 9/11 I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem was found through non-violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and it created unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Over the last four years, the rate of absorption of the child’s hand-inhibiting agent has increased fourfold.
Poison information centres across the United States have reported an increase of almost 400% in the absorption of alcohol-containing hand-inhibiting agents in children under 12 years of age since 2010, reports Georgia’s poisoning information centre.
According to Gaylord Lopez, the Director of the Poison Information Centre in Georgia, cases of swallowing a disinfectant reported to the Poison Information Centres for children under 12 years of age rose from 3266 cases in 2010 to 16117 cases in 2014.
"The children are more interested in these products and unfortunately a certain percentage of them will be sent to the emergency services," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children would drink disinfectant intentionally, while some would like to impress their friends or respond to the challenge in social media.
YouTube has videos where teenagers drink disinfectant to get cheap rises.
According to reports, teenagers have mixed the disinfectant with alcoholic mouthwash to obtain a stronger drink.
The pleasant smell of a disinfectant can attract younger children.
"The child doesn't think this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (handlings) are those to which smell has been added.
There are strawberry, grapes and orange-based disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
The hand disinfectant may contain any alcohol between 45 % and 95 %.
Especially in young children, alcohol poisoning requires only a few injections.
"It's really concentrated alcohol," Mr. Stephen Thornton told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave a whiskey hot on the table, but you're left with a hand-defining agent, and if the kids are interested, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaija Russell is a six - year - old girl who, a while ago, swallowed only four sprays of strawberries at school with hand disinfectants and was taken to emergency care.
His blood alcohol levels were .179, which is twice as high as the limit of adult drinking, reports first aid clinic doctor Chris Ritchey, who treated the girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
When you spoke to your mother, you couldn't walk when she arrived in the first aid.
Doctors followed her overnight in a separate children’s hospital for possible brain damage, for alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"It was really scary," Nhaijah's mother, Ortoria Scott, said to CNN.
The situation could have been lethal for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and move disinfectant away from children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been combined with death.
In 2013, two Ontarion women died after swallowing a hand disinfectant containing toxic, unreported ingredients.
The health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was declared as an active ingredient.
In January, in the northern part of the state of New York, three fourth - graders planned to poison their "bad" teachers by spreading bacterial poison to the classroom, reports the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to the hand disinfectant and denied it in his class.
The police need to prevent the plan as a "supervising nonsense" and leave disciplinary action in the school district.
Hurricane: Celtic has no conflict
Griffiths dissatisfactions about Celtic's contradictions, and Deila admits that Hoops is in a tight place, but she makes it turn.
Hearts is fighting the Scottish football union against Neilson's accusations, and Warburton is guarded by January recruitments that could interfere with the team's unity.
Dons raised his lead in Celtic to five points.
Adam Rooney's first half sentence took Aberdeen to a narrow victory from Hamilton at Pittodri Stadium and allowed the team to increase the difference to five points in Celtic.
Griffiths is undermining talks about cross-continental disputes.
There have been rumors about the internal conflicts between Celtics, but Griffiths immediately passed them. He claims that he and his teammates have no sense of working under closer observation when the team is preparing to meet the Dutch serial leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are waiting to meet.
The lack of the Scots Championship bores the Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers midfield player and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition from the championship with Rangers.
Ajax's current ambassador de Boer said, "The management no longer plays the highlight of the Celtic games, and why?"
Because the Rangers aren't involved.
People here can't just talk about Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the Old Firm teams.
They talk about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
The games of these teams have a lot of tensions, and other non-Scotlands want to watch them play.
Deila swears she'll turn around.
Ronny Deila has admitted she's in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has sworn to turn around.
Lose to Malmö and the resulting drop from the Masters League was quickly followed by a loss to the ten-man Aberdeen, which is now at the top of the series with a five-point difference to the next.
But Deila said, "Celtic has had bad episodes before, and we're getting up again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
We are, too, but we must continue.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton guarded for January players' transfers
Although the Rangers-bom Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on the possible targets of January players' transfers, he is guarded against the most recruiting, convincing that he does not want to confuse the team's consensus.
The former boss of Brentford said, "The transfer window of January is very different from the window of the summer."
For players coming in the summer, there is an entire time before the adjustment, which is reflected in our team during this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can do more harm.
Celtic's interest in Michu suggests that you're alive.
The Swansea attacker Michu, whose name has been associated with the transfer window with Celtic, has suggested that he can retire after his contract with Swans has ended.
For two years, a 29-year-old player has had ankles, and during the summer he was unable to find a new company outside Wales.
Hearts is ready to fight the Scottish football union because of Neilson's comments.
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team disappeared after this 3-2. The defenseman's red card was revoked later, and this was already the third red card that Collum condemned, which was cancelled.
Neilson stays behind his message saying, "I did not question honesty, I did not comment on performance."
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle
The faithful Hibernian player became reprobate when he declared himself singing an offensive song about the former Hearts player, Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in the pub at Edinburgh Roseburn, before the Edinburgh derby Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was derby, and it was a moment's drive," the attacker added, "It's safe to say that I'm not going back to Tynecastle, unless I go out and play Celtic."
The Tannadice government believes in the leadership of Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United government still has faith in the management team's ability to reverse the situation, but admit that the deterioration of players must stop.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll get the boys back to normal," Donnelly says.
McInnes is happy about "drunk victory" in Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately involved in the game against Hamilton Accia, but with Adam Rooney's first half penalty kick, managed to achieve his seventh consecutive league victory, which raised them to the top of the table five points above Celticia.
McInnes says, "There is no team that would have won anything, whether it was a power or a league that would not have won games this way."
The unemployment rate of the Scottishs remains the same as the United Kingdom's total number grew.
EMPLOYMENT In Scotland, 164,000 people remained between May and July, while unemployment in the whole of Great Britain rose to 1.82 million in total.
The rate of unemployment in Scotland is 5.9 per cent higher than in Great Britain 5.5 per cent, with the figures of the National Statistical Centre (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12 000 people over a period of three months, with the number now being 2,612,000.
During the quarter, the employment rate in Scotland fell to 74 per cent, which is higher than the United Kingdom average of 73.5 per cent.
The Scottish State Secretary David Mundell commented on these latest figures: "The long-term management plan is to build a basis for a stronger economy."
Almost a year has passed since Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of Great Britain.
During these 12 months, the Scottish labour market has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has fallen.
Why do I testify to execution in Oklahoma?
If there is no legal intervention, then later today I will watch the man be executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I will sit at the viewers' gallery in Oklahoma State Penitentiary to watch Richard Glossip be executed with a lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
I received a request in January through his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
I'm starting to freak this day out as it approaches.
So why did I say yes?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Of course, suppliers have the opportunity to follow executions in America, and since applications are often more than free places, participants are chosen through horrendous valuation.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of places reserved for the media to 12.
Whoever you choose, you'll watch the event cool.
I can't do it.
I will be sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have also created my connection with him through months of calls and a two-and-a-half hour visit.
I like him.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I can't have a notebook and a pen to save what I see.
I just need to try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist on Twitter accused me of being neutral.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants you to, and you'll get involved.
I complained to the reporter.
He admitted that "it could have done better", but he still believes that what I am doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I say and have written.
He won't tell me what I'm supposed to write, and I won't do that if he says so.
I've told him he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that the public will help to counter the death penalty.
Mr. Huffington Post's reporter Kim Bellware is right next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to a series of podcast broadcasts I made.
I'm not going through all the details again.
I can't be sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would, in any case, help him.
But I think there's a very strong chance he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there wasn't enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think it's wrong to execute him.
And this is the point of view I see him dying from.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
There will be other journalists there who will take care of it.
I'll give you a description of what it feels like to watch the man I like die unnecessaryly.
The man was dragged out of the Canning River after a watery police hunt.
Officer Canning Vale stayed dry when he lured the man out of the Canning River.
The attempt of a man from Perth to distract the police from their positions went wrong when he found himself in a shallow, muddy water just a few feet away from a police officer who tried to "go back to the beach gently".
The Canning Vale police called Beckenham on Tuesday because of an unauthorized invasion.
When they found the suspect, he tried to distract them by heading for the Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
"He was standing in the water saying "I'm not coming out, come and get me," told Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to get wet, so he used safer tactics: "a proper police negotiation".
"Some people do funny things when trying to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
The champion football player Ben Cousins is an impressive example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing and tried to swim across the Swan River.
He failed in his business, but inspired the locals to start planning a playful Ben Thomas biathlon.
Peter Moody claims the contractors tried to spy on him and threatens to stop competing.
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria's agents tried to infiltrate his collateral last year and threatens to stop competing immediately.
He blames the authors and the Racing Victoria Department for their personal campaign against him. On Wednesday, the late rejection of Lady Tatai due to the treatment procedure on the day of the race was the last thread.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for the competition and that he has been in a difficult situation since Lidar’s unexplained positive coconut sample.
He has kept his tongue under control for a year and a half about spy claims, and he did not want "it looks like envy".
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so frustrated that everything breaks down at once," Moody said.
They knew it was going on.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm sleeping well.
I want to head up, and I want the owners to think I'm doing my best to them.
When they start thinking differently, I should no longer continue as a coach.
Then I'd have to consider what I'm doing with my license.
Previously, Moody dropped a bomb racing.com site at an interview where he told me that the integrity department had been trying to spy on his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in the room with a guy when I asked him about his name and offered him a job in my safe deposit if he gave me information about what I'm doing there.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, they really should fire their lawyers, because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of Racing Victoria, David Moodi, current Chairman of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundery, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware and aware of that today.
Should I start thinking this is becoming personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to join forces and perhaps transfer responsibility to other than coaching for what is happening in this area?
Am I harmful to the business?
Am I that harmful to the business?
Maybe that's what people think.
Perhaps they have to take my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that what I say may cause them to think about it.
But I'm at the point now that I don't care anymore, and it makes me sad.
It really makes me sad.
I urge them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back on this.
Coach's frustration has increased with a long-term study of Lidar's cobalt, and the late rejection has led him to find that he could "switch over his license table".
Moody, best known for coaching the undefeated champion Black Caviari, has called the rules on day-to-day treatment "murder" after the mud or clay has been placed on the horse's feet, which is irregular.
"It's against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my employees put mud on his leg in a mistake.
It could have had a hatchet last night.
It could have had it yesterday, just like it had.
It had it on the day of the race.
Moody may face a three-month non-competition ban on day-to-day search, from which the experts started the study.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about a horse.
"All of us understand that rules are required, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Arrested driver in Cobra
The police have arrested a man who was guilty of a traffic jam after colliding a cyclist in Cobra this weekend.
The cyclist was transported by air to the Royal Melbourne Hospital hospital after he suffered serious injuries when the car crashed on Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
The police told me that the driver drove away and didn't stop to help the injured biker.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia registered himself to the police at Shepparton.
He will be accused of not stopping in an accident, of failure to provide assistance and of other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobra, is still in the hospital and his condition is stable.
The Melbourne Storm team coach Craig Bellamy attacks the rivals against the button claims
Coach Craig Bellamy has also criticised the claims made by two NRL-rugbyliga champions that the action of his team would be part of the "guidance".
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said that the referees allowed Storm to "press" on their side when he suddenly won the finals in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos Coach Wayne Bennett barely covered up his reference to Storm after winning the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night at the finals. Bennett called the game a rugby league "playing window" and said that two Queensland teams were not "hardly excited" button.
Bellamy defended her team's attacks and said they were just focusing on "Contact" fighting.
Bellamy added that her trust was increased by the criticism of the two leading coachs of Storm, which means that they fear losing to the team.
"This always comes to mind - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we lost 24-2", Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we have not exchanged anything in our defence systems or technologies throughout the year. In the last six weeks, we have only put pressure on contacts in battles, and it has made us succeed.
Trent has been on the team for three years, and he clearly has a great team to train, so he is probably not used to losing, so this was a little shock to him.
It's funny how it always comes to this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of an "excitable rugby" by reminding his mentor that St George Illawarra Dragons, trained by Bennett, won the championship in 2010 by playing "extremely".
Wayne's talking about exciting rugby.
He considered it important to compare his Saturday night game with our Friday night game and tell them how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St George was often criticised for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn't care less.
But now he's got a team that can play the rugby we think is exciting, especially when he's got fast young friends.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have players of its type.
He brought it up on the side of 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby - not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt in order to play like that.
I am becoming more confident when they say such things because they are a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as an objection to important games.
Bellamy also noted that the game between Storm and Roosters was more scored than the game between Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was certainly a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more goals, but is it exciting rugby?
Or does it make it an exciting violation of the line of defense and a failure to finish the goal?
For me, this is about guidelines.
If they mention us, it means that we can play against them somewhere.
Storm is free this weekend because they have already won the right to a home game against either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks for next Saturday night's premiere in AAMI Park. Tickets will be sold next Tuesday morning.
Serb man's $200,000 bail on the drug charge.
A man who is threatened with a lifespan of 40 kg of cocaine smuggled to Queensland has been released against a bail of 200 000 dollars.
29-year-old Marko Maksimovic is one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police had traced 100 kilos of drugs to Solay yachts that came to South America through Vanuatu and were shipyarded in Coomera in August.
Maximovic was seen meeting others at the accused boatport all morning, and then he met them at the Coomer Roadhouse cafe, where the police found 40 kilos of drugs in the Tokyo Echo car.
Although Maximovici threatens the potential lifespan of a cocaine holding company for business purposes, his lawyer claimed that there was no evidence that Maximovic tried to hold the whole quantity and that he could be in the cafe for absolutely innocent reasons.
Judge Peter Flanagan of the Supreme Court was concerned that Maximovic was trying to escape.
"He's got a solid connection to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," he told the court on Wednesday.
In a criminal case, Maximovic lied to the police about where he lived.
Together, Maximovic’s mother and stepfather had offered a $200,000 guarantee to ensure his release.
"After reading the sworn certificates of both persons, it is clear that setting a guarantee of 200 000 dollars is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
But it was not enough to prevent him from appearing before justice, he warned.
The guarantee was granted to Maximovic on condition that he gives up his passports from both Australia and Serbia, reports to the police daily, and adheres to his ban on the free movement between 6 p.m. and 6 p.m.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures.
The pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl asking for photos of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl while sleeping on this phone and then logged in to the online communications service where Hogg received numerous immoral images of children sent to her by another user.
She woke up later, found that the phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
She looked at her phone and found shocking messages, and immediately she told her mother.
When the police came, they saw five images, looked at the computers on the ground, and found "problemable" web searches using the search methods used to search for unclean images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this to "beautiful paedophiles" on the Internet before he "been a cop to scare them".
Mr Robertson, Member of the Fiscal depute, told the Dundeen Sheriff Court the following: "He said that it was an addiction - that he was dependent on scaring people.
He admitted that he had carried out a search on a computer, but said that they had only been done because he wanted to pretend he was a cop so he could scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about the discussions with an unknown person who sent him the pictures, and about the time Hogg asked him to send him more pictures.
Hogg said he only did this for bait purposes.
He said after he got sick, he wanted to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: "When the girl found the pictures of her phone, she screamed at her mother, shaked and cried.
My mother saw the innocent pictures on the phone and then met the defendant.
She was interviewed, and she told me that the defendant had used a computer and a Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
The 23-year-old Hogg, who lives on Ward Road in Dundea, accused him of making or taking pictures of innocent children on June 14th of last year. He broke the guarantee on January 25th of this year and failed to come to court on March 24th of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be registered as a sex offender, for it can be argued that his crime did not include a "serious sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the sentence until October, so that the social services would have time to prepare the background reports.
Hogg was granted guarantees in this case, but in other ongoing cases, he is in custody before the hearing.
He was added to the sex offender's record before the date of the sentence.
Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe, gave the wrong speech to Parliament
The oldest leader in Africa, Mugabe, fell earlier this year in the leading stairs to the speaker’s high - pitch.
He didn't get hurt, but the video of the crash spread like a virus in social media.
Parliament's opening ceremony was also covered by the opposition's legislators' claims that they had been sent with anonymous threats of death, in which they were warned not to barge to Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they hurried and interrupted him by cries when he gave a speech to Parliament on the state of the country - which he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Group leader Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones, which warned them not to interfere with Mugabe's speech.
"The number from which the message was sent is not answered, but the message is entitled 'Death'," Gonese told the journalists after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned the members concerned that immunity would end in Parliament, and when they entered out, parliamentary immunity would not be valid.
The group leader said that the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "scared" for threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is committed to cutting 25 000-30 000 jobs as part of its restructuring and operating efforts in business services.
Later this year HP is divided into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer business from the faster growing enterprise equipment and service activities.
Expected job cuts bring about $2.7 billion in expenses starting from the fourth quarter, the HP announcement said.
"These restructuring measures allow for a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, Chairman of HP and Managing Director, who will lead the unit after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than today's HP, and we will have a wide and deep range of services to help companies move into a new kind of business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to respond to the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
The annual turnover of Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be over $50 billion, and it is "focused on producing comparable integrated technology solutions" for companies, according to the company’s press release.
The division breaks down the company that Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, who graduated from Stanford University University, set up in the 1930s to manufacture electrical supplies.
HP has been through a huge restructuring process to cope with the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the world’s second largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology firm in the United States, and its distribution is the latest in an area based on the belief that strictly limited companies are doing better.
Captain Arsenal Mikel Arteta says that teammates must support the injured Jack Wilsherea before the Dinamo Zagreb game.
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is now only September and assuming that his rehabilitation will go according to plan, there is no reason why he would not be playing again by Christmas.
Even in this best case, Wilshere misses at least four next English games and, given his background, it is uncertain whether he will participate in the European championships next summer.
The biggest pity in this most recent problem is that the end of the last season of Wilshere was strong after one of the most disgusting, and he remembered his old sharpness before the beginning of the season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten your career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as well as Wenger admitted, a player trying to return through the middle always has an additional risk of injury.
There is also a uncomfortable model in the formation.
Studies by Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilshe had 23 different injuries since she debuted six years ago.
In addition, he has been playing Arsenal 157 in only 65 games during the last five seasons.
In view of Arsenal's wider total since 2007-08, six out of eight have been one of the Valioliiga teams who have lost the most days due to the injury.
Wenger acknowledges the possibility of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that their last-season improvement in disability statistics will continue.
"Sometime when you return from the injury can be a vulnerable period, when you need to strengthen your body and get a competition," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body will stabilise, I am sure that it will, and that he will have the career he deserves.
Wenger is preparing to recycle his team when Arsenal starts his championship game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then on Saturday, playing Chelsea and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be at the start.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroudin Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to maintain balance and give a break to players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear extension popular in division F, at the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb, Europe's most frightening.
Also, the Dinamo has not disappeared in 41 games since they produced their own "Undefeated" campaign in the last season.
On Tuesday night, the stadium was shaken by an earthquake of 3.2 degrees on the Richter scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned last season from the Master League's surrender against Monaco, and he is still motivated by the distant dream of leading the team to its first European Cup.
"This motivation is huge," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I can be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is striking how similar descriptions are not in the series, especially in view of the need for men to open up more desperate than ever, and the suicide rates of young men are higher than 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the biggest cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 years in Britain, which is three times more common in men than in women.
In the company, the Campaign Aginst Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 for men. The aim was to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they needed it.
Friendliness is at the heart of this challenge.
The recent study included more than 2,000 upper secondary and upper secondary school students who showed symptoms of depression. According to the study, a person’s ability to recover doubled if a high enough percentage of his friends were “healthy”.
Similarly, those who were not depressed had half the likelihood of any mental health problems occurring if they had healthy friends in mind.
But in order for friendship to work, it has to be available first.
In this social media the communication time the style passes through the content and the immediateness of the answer is often more important than the relevant contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to seem strong, happy and successful, even though isolation really rules.
This superficial success is dominated by the values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All this happens to internal values - the personal growth and friendship of the inner longing - at the expense of our mental health.
And as the billionaire video game developer recently explained, money really doesn't get any more happiness.
The beauty of the Frendis was just that it turned this focus on the top.
No character was defined by their work, but rather by their personality, which clearly differed in interaction as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs watching football, Ross missing Rachel - their humor came from the fact that, yes, men can relate to all of this, even though they often hesitate to study their feelings completely.
As the volunteer worker of the Samaritans explained to me: ... "When I listened to people who are depressed and self-destructive, I really understood how the smallest interaction with a friend can improve your feeling."
Often, men who contact us feel they can't talk to friends.
The old idea of "overcoming" is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up from problems, you will be seen as weak.
Frendit is one of those series that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term ways of survival.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
Although my objective, external position at the other end of the phone helps people at desperate moments, long-term support comes from a close, personal family and friends network.
And so if you're going to be at Comedy Central's FriendsFest this weekend, and all the shooting sites are redesigned to celebrate, why don't you take your friends to Central Perk for coffee?
Or better yet, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Frendit will be sent to Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, participate in #FriendsFest
Di Maria's going to score and help PSG tap into Malmo's side.
Angel Di Maria is celebrating goals against Malmo with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan.
Angel Di Maria scored the Master League in her debut, helping PSG to pass the Swedish team on Malmo Tuesday.
Below the match report and the reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started their Championship league game with a nice 2-0 win against Malmö at Parc des Princess on Tuesday.
Di Maria made a goal in her debut of the Masters League less than four minutes, pointing the way to the French league champions, but the team lost many opportunities before they finally increased their head start at Cavan's attack on the 61st.
Paris, in the same section as Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champion, because the game was not only a continuation, but also an improvement in their fourth-final games in the last three rounds.
But even though PSG took the points, it wasn't a classic game, because Laurent Blanc's team, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, lost their place in front of the goal and later was switched from the field. Malmö is his old hometown team and the team where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or at guests in the Masters League, so a 2-0 victory will cause problems for the opponent and show good statistics, and it is a good start, although there are things that we have to sand this season," Blanc said.
This anticipates good things.
We wanted to win and we won, even though I regret not having managed to do one or two more goals.
After the injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisian team for one of the three changes that he had made since the team left the 2-2 game in the League 1 home game against Bordeaux on the weekend, but he remained in Di Maria's shadow on the fourth minute.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentineer was named a man who takes PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why he ran into Marco Verratt's feed behind the Malmo defense line and then hit a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland in the back corner of the network.
However, if someone expected an easy and big profit from PSG, they were disappointed.
Malmö was a closed opponent, and he won the game in the game of the Celtic when he reached this level, with nine international players and a five-man defense in the opening field, as well as two players deep in the midfield.
But on the offensive side, the team offered nothing more than the 34th minute of Nikola Djurjic's launch, which went past the button on Kevin Trapp's goal.
On the other hand, PSG was sometimes in trouble due to the losses and poor finishing, especially of Ibrahimovic, which failed in all five companies only in the first half of the time and then was disappointed when Cavani put the ball in from Ibrahimovic’s contact at the beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more effective when he pre-worked for his colleagues, and it was from Ibrahimovic’s pitch that Di Maria sent in a round kick, which tilted around the 52nd minute of Wiland’s goal.
The second goal was finally achieved after an hour of the game thanks to the six - year - old suburb Cavan after Ibrahimovic’s click on the left of Maxwell’s crossbreed.
That was the end of Malmo's hopes of getting back into the game, and only Wiland's great fight for David Luiz's direct kick kept the finals down before the switch of Ezequiel Lavez's goal was rejected at the end of the game.
Malmö Coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was as high as his team. The Norwegian said, "Our latest championship league game was last December."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
It's not enough to fight back.
I'm gonna go get a hat for Paris.
This was a great game from them.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion for stock sales
The mine industry in Switzerland left Glencore, which suffered from a fall in the price of commodities, raised 2.5 billion dollars on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its extensive debt surgery plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, announced in the service that it had sold new shares for some £1.6 billion to reduce its debt.
The company, which lost 57 % of its market value this year, is struggling with prices of collapsed commodities when the slowdown in the Chinese economy is placing pressure on demand and causing destruction on all markets.
The new brand added the value of Glencore’s shares to the top of the London Stock Exchange in the morning shops on Wednesday.
The shares rose by 2.77% to 131.60 pence in the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had revealed last week a $2.5 billion share trade as part of its wider plan to cut its 30 billion debt load by about a third.
The company sold new share capital with 125 pn, which meant a reduction of 2.4 per cent on Tuesdays to the final price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares with a total value of 9.99 per cent of the merger.
Concerns about the long-standing stagnation of China's growth have cut iron ore prices by about half, while prices for coal, copper and other commodities have decreased by 20-40%.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington.
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make state visits to the United States at the end of the month, confirmed by the White House's opinion on Tuesday.
Xi's first official visit to Washington will take place on 25 September and is the answer to President Barack Obama's last November visit to Beijing, said the opinion.
The President of the United States and the President’s spouse, Michelle Obama, will arrange dinner for Xi and his spouse Peng Liyuan after the leaders have held bilateral negotiations.
"Principle X's visit allows for the expansion of cooperation between the United States and China on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, and at the same time gives President Obama and President X the opportunity to discuss constructively issues with disagreement" was increased.
A visit that was published for the first time in February, Xin is also expected to depart from Seattle on his way to Washington to meet a number of U.S. technology leaders before continuing to the New York City and the United Nations General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concerns about China's alleged web-sparing and the increased country's unconditionalness in the South Chinan waters.
Matt Damon is undermining the difference in filmmaking.
Matt Damon and Effie Brown, an African American filmmaker, had a conversation about a variety that Damon said was not needed behind the scenes.
The actor who had experienced the HBO's Sunday evening in the Project Greenlight section interrupted Brown in emphasising the need for different perspectives as regards the dark main character of the script chosen for the project.
"When we talk about diversity, it will be taken into account when selecting actors in the film, not in the series," Damon claimed.
The shocked Brown reacted with disbelief, with the comments "Oh! Wow. Okay" while the comments of The Martian's actor remained hanging in the air.
The other producers, Ben Affleck and Farrelly's brothers, joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finalists of the series.
"I want people to think about how they treat Harmony's character," Brown said.
The only dark figure he's got is a whore hit by his white pimp.
The Dear White People's producer insisted on the film's rights to the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon replied harshly that their direction should "be allowed to give us something we do not want".
When the conversation was sent, the social media blew up Damon's comments.
The Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the film clip, writing: "Matt Damon speaking on the only dark person in the room and explaining to him the difference is so white that it happens."
Twiittatus collected over 5,000 rewirings and 4,000 tweaks after his publication.
Damon's comments are at a time when the exact racial presentation in the media is at the forefront of the social debate.
After the White Police killed a teenage Michael Brown in 2014, The Black Lives Matter became global and called on legislators and authorities to put an end to discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, the singer Prince referred to the issue as the winner of the Grammy Prize for the Year album candidates.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The leaders of Black Lives Matter recently published a statement in order to answer the question of the Fox News TV face, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, as to whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
It was recently reported that Damon is involved among entertainers, producers, and media moguls who have been invited to visit the Pope to discuss the picture of the Catholic Church in the west.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope.
First American Ninja Warrior crowned
Isaac Caldiero, a professional dialecter and container collector, became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and won a million dollars main prize.
It is precisely in the competition programme which has ended in its seventh period that there has never been a competitor who would have survived all of the parts of the programme's obstacle track.
In the final episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, survived the last round.
In the last mission, we had to climb a 20-foot rope in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and settled the challenge on time, which allowed him to become the first athlete of all time to find out about the exhausting 4th part of the American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero did find out the challenge three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
Caldiero gave the interview to E!News after a difficult victory and was still shocked by winning the million dollar main prize.
"It's great to think about this when I've never made or lived more than $100,000 a year," Isaac told E! after his big raise.
So all of a sudden... I can't even imagine what it's gonna be like... the future is unknown.
Production Director Kent Weed sat down to talk with The Hollywood Reporter about the finale and why Britten doesn't get more reward money, even though he's the first competitor of all time who's managed to cross the track.
The rules say the money goes to the fastest person.
"If more than one person passes, the money will be given to the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
Although money is a great reward and changes life, he gets a great feeling of satisfaction.
I don't think that's why he feels bad.
He's just so happy he's done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy, and he's a good family father.
He's the hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If someone had to beat me, I'm happy it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have thought the same way if it had gone the other way.
The American Ninja Warrior will return to the eighth period, the descriptions of which will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneaked past Minnesota Twins
The other half of the season hasn't been so much fun for Detroit Tigers.
Tigers was one of the best baseball teams ever, but now he's the last of America's League Central division.
Tigers played his part perfectly on Tuesday when he won the Minnesota Twins 5-4 Target Field.
Twins lost the chance to go half the way from Houston Astros to the second place in the American League.
The game for Detroit was to return to the six-letter H-word for at least one night, which had been very difficult to reach most of the latter half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how they are," said Tigers' team leader Brad Ausmus.
Tigers feeder Alfredo Simon continued his early attack support when Detroit ran three times in the first two rounds, and then once in the sixth and once again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) baited 6 1/3 in a row and let go three runs.
This was only his third quality start in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong end for this year," Simon said.
It's hard for a changer to feed every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers' surrogate Victor Martinez hit three times and allowed two runs that were his first hit after mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three nights after he struck Seattle Mariners four times on July 6th.
"He waved the bat well," Ausmus said.
He looked good (in punch exercises), looked significantly better at punching exercises and continued the same model in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the second half of the seventh round, and that was their best chance of getting back into the game.
Centrifugal Byron Buxton started the shift by hitting the left field line twice.
On the right side Aaron Hicks came home with a touch of one nest, and Simon got burned directly by another nest player Brian Dozier before Simon was switched to left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only opponent against, the pre-initiating replacementist Miguel Sanoma, who pulled two nests to the left of the right-handed Drew VerHagen.
With two runners in the field and a smoothing runner in the second nest, VerHagen got a three-bedroom Trevor Plouffe to hit a double-game paint.
This was the main series record: the 27th time this season, when Plouffe doubled.
After Detroit had received the ninth run, Mauer pulled two hit runs against Tigers' lock-up on Bruce Rondon, and the situation was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player burned the Word in three feedings in his fifth salvation.
Detroit used Phil Hughes, who was rusty at first.
Tigers got three runs in the first two pairs against a right-handed veteran player who got off the list before the game after being away for more than a month due to lower back infection.
"It's obvious that I didn't want this kind of beginning," Hughes said, "but as the game went on, I was more comfortable, and I felt I was able to make some nice baits on my third shift."
After Hughes caught the starter on the first nest, he let the second nest player Ian Kinsler go one by one.
Walking on the right side of J.D. Martinez in two fires brought Victor Martinez, who took himself to the first base with a midfield drive and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez cut off his 0-21 tube while the runners were running in good runs.
The third base player Nick Castellanos continued by hitting the right and causing another run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was rejected in his attempt to move on to the third base.
Tigers continued in a second shift and got one fire, two nest situations involving the kidnapper James McCann and two fires, one nest in the situation of the centre Anthony Gosel, followed by 3-0.
"It was an important shot," said Paul Molitor, Team Leader of Twins.
He didn't hit him very well, but he flew to the right.
Hughes began to be in the feed readings and fed an impenetrable third shifter, after which he replaced the right-handed successor A.J. Achter.
The Hughes was calculated three runs from six punches and a walk with four fires.
Note: Tigers' right-handed feeder, Anibal Sanchez, was forced to throw away because of the stretch of his shoulder.
He's being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of injured people since mid-August due to the shoulder-stealing, but she had to return on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is out, the left-handed feeder Daniel Norris is coming from the injured list to start up against Twins.
Norrish's statistics on Tigers are 1-1 in four initiatives since David Price, left-handed, was switched to him on 30 July.
Norris has been out since August 20th due to a correct twitch of abstinence.
The three-game series of Tigers and Twins will end on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) sets up against Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA) in Minnesota.
Xi calls for a wider economy to be opened up to the world
The economy should help the outside world to promote growth more, President Xi Jinping told a group on Tuesday to guide the reform.
"China should commit itself to attracting foreign funding and expertise and to develop a policy of transparency", he said when he spoke at the 16th meeting of the group leading to the deepening of the overall reform.
Supporting transparency at the same time as driving reforms forward with more new movements and vitality, and creating a new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Governing Board adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list of market entry restrictions, a loosening of border control principles, a call for state-owned companies to take on private capital and a review of the resident registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list will be created which will identify the sectors and companies that cannot be invested in.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through pilot programmes.
The change is significant because it will give the market a greater role in resource allocation, ensure a legal business environment and make the market more transparent, the opinion notes.
The government also loosens its control of the power it divides to companies, thus ensuring that companies decide on how to manage their business.
The opinion also stated that China would allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
In order to open up sectors governed by the state, more sectors will be opened up to private donors.
"With regard to foreign investment, the administration does not change its direction and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign financing companies and provide them with better services," the opinion said.
In addition, the search process for foreign permanent residence permits, "green cards", will be facilitated by optimising requirements and reducing the search process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the professional rights of lawyers and the support of judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as by senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in the opinion published after the meeting.
