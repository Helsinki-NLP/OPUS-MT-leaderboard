Two powerful women share the secrets of their success
What's in common with Barbara Corcoran and Laila Ali?
At first glance, these women come from two completely different worlds.
Barbara Corcoran, the New York real estate magnate, was able to convert a thousand-dollar loan into a worth-to-five billion real estate companies before applying her expertise on the television screen, participating in the ABC reality series "Shark Tank" investor panel.
Laila Ali has been following her father, becoming the four-time undefeated champion of the most successful female boxer before her resume was added to the roles of the TV host, author and speaker.
Despite their unique career paths (or perhaps because of them), TJ Maxx recruited both women to help the full range of hopeful entrepreneurs to break the stereotypes and achieve the high-flying goals.
Last year T.J. Maxx spoke to hundreds of women at shops across the country and discovered that 80 percent of them feel that society has given them stereotypically certain roles and expectations.
As a result, they came out with The Maxx You Project to help women break these barriers.
Corcoron and Ali know a lot about it, but they may be at the top of their field by now, but the journey wasn't smooth for either of them.
Corcoran was awarded Ds in high school and college and had already worked 20 jobs when he was 23 years old.
Ali entered one of the most men - centered areas, and on his way she faced the challenge of trying to step out of the shadow of her father, who was a world icon.
These two, to put it softly, are packing through the knowledge acquired by difficulty.
That is why we sat down with these powerful women to talk about overcoming failures, successes and trusting our stomachs in business and relationships.
What inspires you to do what you do every day?
Laila Ali: I am inspired by my personal goals every day.
I've designed a habit of writing down things I want to achieve.
And I'm looking at this list.
I think I'm responsible.
Of course, my children inspire me.
My ambitions inspire me.
I wish I could be a winner in everything I do in my life.
I understand that it takes a lot of work to achieve my goals, but I'm ready to do it.
My confidence comes from preparation.
So I spend a lot of time preparing.
Barbara Corcoran: Like Lailagi, my confidence is being overprepared, but I will not get my inspiration from it.
Actually, I'm inspired by the true curiosity.
What happens when I do this?
What's it gonna be if I don't?
This curiosity makes me get out of bed in the morning because I can't wait to see what the day brings with me.
If I don't feel that way some day, I'm just faking these feelings.
Then I'm gonna be astonished by myself, and I'm gonna be inspired again.
Tell me about some obstacles in your career that made you better in the long term.
Barbara Corcoran: For me it was the hardest time my business partner left me and married my secretary.
I finished business a year later, but this year of my life - being a fifth wheel - was terrible because I didn't have the confidence to leave.
I felt subdued. There was no inspiration.
But amazing things happen.
The hardest thing to believe is when you're hit back.
To get on your feet and start business again from scratch - this time without a partner - it was a very difficult year.
Laila Ali: I would say that my career was the hardest time when I was boxing, I was at the top of my career and decided to give up the divorce.
I didn't just divorce my husband, but also the manager and the person who taught me everything I know about boxing.
I didn't think I could handle it without him.
So I began to worry about my career for the future and had to find the time to take a step back and say to myself, "You have all the necessary knowledge and experience.
You have all these experiences in boxing.
You can definitely do that."
So I formed a new team around me and continued my career.
In fact, it was simply necessary to achieve the right state of mind, since everyone else got a boost from there.
I did what had to be done, I had to face fear and find the courage to get rid of my husband and manager and continue with my career, and it all worked out.
When did you feel that you really were successful?
Laila Ali: I felt like I was successful when I won my first championship title.
It was a really good feeling, because when I started boxing, I wanted to be one of the best, to be undefeated.
I was able to achieve this goal, and I didn't win the championship title one time, four times.
Barbara Corcoran: The moment I felt successful was my eleventh year in action.
I had finally made a profit.
I had earned a profit of about 42,000 dollars that I couldn't expect.
I went out right away and bought a new car for both my mom and dad, and they never had a new car, so I had them delivered to Florida, where they kept their retirement.
I felt like the Queen of England.
I felt so cool.
In the years that followed, I served much more, but nothing has been able to offer an equivalent feeling so far as to give back something to my parents and surprise them.
How could you keep on motivated during this 11-year period to continue working?
Barbara Corcoran: I never measured my business by profit, because that was not my goal.
I just wanted to see how far I could get.
I made myself a dream of becoming New York Real Estate Queen on the first day of my life.
And I saw myself in the eyes of the Pope, as if everyone kissed my ring and adored me.
I had such a little thought in my head.
So, when I kept working every day, every hour, I didn't really think about making money.
Finally, I made money by accident.
But all the money that came in, I went right back to business.
I don't even think I've had a lot of disturbing days where I would have thought, oh, God, we don't make any money.
I was just convinced that something was going to work.
The worst thing that could have happened would have been to lose the company and become a waitress again.
So I made a good tip, and I was happy.
I could be happy again.
That is why I do not believe that money is the great endeavour of many people who have succeeded.
They have other motives that encourage them.
And the money wasn't one of mine.
Do you have any advice for someone with such great dreams, but who is held back by the financial factor?
Barbara Corcoran: When I started making a lot of money, I had money to invest in real estate, but I didn't have time.
I set up a business.
And that's why I found five different partners who weren't even specialists in the broker shop, but in different neighbourhoods all over town who knew their streets and broke up.
I approached them and said, "You know this neighborhood.
Find me the best building.
I'll give you the money and you'll be my partner."
The lesson here is that if you have money, you need people to make money with your money.
And if you have a gift, you can sell it to someone with money and make money.
Here are two aspects: talent and money.
But if you don't have both together, it won't be too big.
In the end, I - and also my partners - have been doing very well in all these years with those excellent investors I would never have had if I had the courage to find the desire to fight people who like to step in.
It is always possible to raise money if you believe that you have a gift and know your part of the world better than anyone else.
What are the two or three things you do every morning to help you succeed?
Laila Ali: I don't know about you, but I have a lot of moments in my life when I feel unburdened, being a mother, a business woman, a husband... all the roles we play as women.
I got to a point in my life where I really had to fix the morning routine.
I like to get up and just feel grateful.
Thank you for your resurrection, your health, your children, your family.
I often write down my goals at night for the next day, and when I wake up, I'm gonna look at this list again.
I do.
Sometimes I write in a diary.
I always have a cup of coffee.
And I always do my first thing in the morning, 'cause if I don't, it's not gonna happen.
For me, it is ultimately a matter of priorities.
These are things that are important to me: my spirituality, my focus on the universe and God, then training and putting my health first.
It makes everything else look easy.
I feel like I can conquer every challenge in a day that gets in my way.
Barbara Corcoran: I set things straight.
I'm working on a list of my tasks, which is endless and ridiculous.
And I'll put what's most important.
What are the real priorities?
I try to accept these most important things.
What are you doing to get yourself into the right state of mind for a big meeting?
Barbara Corcoran: I can imagine myself falling through.
It's as weird as it is.
I mean, Lord, I'm failing.
I scare myself, and it makes me try harder.
I can imagine anyone who competes with me - I am, by nature, very combatative because I am one of the ten children and we never get enough attention from our parents.
I can be very competitive.
And I'll always be there too thoroughly prepared.
Too much preparation strengthens my confidence.
Laila Ali: Amazing how opposite we are in this regard.
We are two successful people, and this shows how different things work for different people.
I like to imagine I'm successful.
I like to think about what's going on.
I imagine it in spirit eyes, I see it actually happening.
I see a boxing ring, a fight, myself winning the belt and returning to the dressing room, celebrating with a winning piece of cake, as I've always done.
The same applies to meetings.
However, I always prepare myself thoroughly. This confidence is the result of preparation, because it is a fear that I am not doing well or I am not saying the right things or not having the necessary information.
This is where I'm about to get ready for the game.
But I always enter by visualizing the final result.
You've both been very successful in your career.
How do you pass it on?
Laila Ali: I am very excited to be part of the T.J. Maxx project Maxx You Project because I feel that this is a chance to do good.
A lot of women need inspiration, encouragement, and ambition to pursue their dreams and goals.
There's a champion in all of us.
It's actually a matter of insolence and the possession of the necessary tools, surrounding yourself with the right people, people who have been able to achieve the things you're trying to accomplish.
Barbara Corcoran: One thing I think is doing very well is inspiring people.
That's why I was very excited when I was asked to work with Maxx You Project.
I try to light the flame of individuality and inspiration that we see here in the faces of all these people and give them practical advice on how to move forward.
Many people begin to realize their dreams, but at some point they tend to be lost on the road.
So we try to help them focus on their goals.
Everything we teach is practical.
Business planning, even as simple as an elevator call, all you need to set up a business.
What advice would you give to women who wish to make progress in male-centred areas?
Laila Ali: I act in one of the most men-centred areas, which is boxing.
Coming after his father, who was a global icon and the best of all time, was quite perverse.
For me, the essence of the matter was, in fact, to find its own strength, its courage, its strength.
The first thing I had to believe in was that I could get into a boxing ring and be successful.
At that time, no one else touched the matter except me, and there were no restrictions in my way other than those I had set myself up in my head.
If you believe in yourself and find your passion, no one can stop you.
Barbara Corcoran: The journey between finding inspiration and having a attitude like me - "The New York Real Estate Queen" - and crossing the finish line is enormously long.
And at this intermediate stage, every day in your career, you need a lot of talent.
There is no need to act on real estate sales in order to need these gifts.
I am sure that in the Laila area too, it was necessary to decide what the right people were like, the right managers, when to start, when to finish, when you have a lot of money you can put in what you can not, how hard you are to work.
These are all subjective decisions.
I'm trying to make these efforts a little more supportive, so these women really feel, "Okay, I get it now.
Let me try.
Here are my three priorities."
When they leave with three main priorities to really make things happen, I go home at night smiling to bed.
What's on your nightstand right now?
Laila Ali: Too many holes.
Journals, books, little prayer angel, my journal.
Probably a bottle of water.
Barbara Corcoran: On my nightstand there is a small green wake-up clock because I tried to break the habit every morning as the first thing to watch the phone.
That's why I got it.
That was cute.
But it never worked.
And he's still standing there.
And my phone's still on my nightstand.
What book are you reading now?
Barbara Corcoran: The eighth or ninth times "How to defeat friends and influence people".
It keeps me on the right track.
I think it's still the best book written in this field, no matter what your dreams are, dreams cannot be achieved without other people.
And it is possible to communicate with it today just as it was in the past.
I like to read it from time to time.
It'll help me get on the right track again.
Laila Ali: I study nutrition school, which is why I'm reading the book No Wheat Diet.
It's about eating cereals and how they affect our bodies.
I'm very interested in that.
What is your best advice to cope with successes and failures?
Barbara Corcoran: Ignore the pessimists.
They meet in all kinds of different shapes.
You have to remove them from your brain's vocabulary.
Stay away from the whiskers.
They suck you out of energy.
I'm dealing with a bunch of grumpy people like a thief.
They'll come at night, they'll get your wallet and they'll leave.
The pessimists will destroy the crew in any team situation faster than you can blink, because people who feel sorry for themselves want others to feel bad too.
They're pulling good people in a hole with them.
I can perfectly avoid all negative people within a 50 km radius of myself, because my goal is to be positive and to take everything from life that gives me, and to receive everything I have to offer.
So why would I want to spend a minute on people like that?
Laila Ali: There must be consistency.
We start on many occasions with conviction that we are now taking that path.
Let's do this, this and this.
But people don't follow it long enough.
Sometimes they give up just before they reach the last hill.
So I think we need to stay on course.
If you feel passionate about something, believe in something, you have to be consistent.
And you have to do the hard work that success requires.
Barbara Corcoran: Much needs to be done to ensure consistency.
Do you know what it takes?
Finishing things.
If you start something, stop it.
Many are skilled beginners, but not very skilled graduates.
In Latvia, the most non-residents live in Daugavpils, Riga and Liepaja.
Latvia has 125 344, Daugavpils 14 266 and Liepājas 11 909.
Outside the big bird, Latvia is the largest resident of stateless people in Jekabpils (2347) and Valmiera (1235).
At the beginning of 2017, 242 560 people lived in Latvia who had no Latvian citizenship.
In 2007, Latvia had a nationality of 392,816 persons.
Jürgen Ligi recently referred to on Facebook: "Citat is a poor reason".
Therefore, I will not look back and try not to recall what has been done and what results have been achieved in the history of human nature.
I do not estimate whether these tests can be considered successful or failed.
I also avoid excessive source references, although I rely on the idea of my most important teacher Thomas Paul: all my thoughts are borrowed from somewhere, if only I could remember exactly where.
The most outstanding boost in Estonia today is the retraining of a citizen of the Republic of Estonia - a perfect human being.
We don't raise him like we raise a child in good faith that he'll be human.
We are raising him as the ruling class imagines it - what one person must be, that he may live in Estonia and speak publicly.
The censorship is perfect.
Although the local ruling class changed part a year ago, some farming methods are as frightening as they were in the previous ruling class, now impoverished nobles - their brutality does not fall to the slightest extent.
They're just different.
Latvia’s beer is a brandy of fine-tuning of the new era.
For Heads of State: 0,5 promilli
The ruling class includes not only politicians who get paid for their work by the state, but also those self-conscious who do politics voluntarily (read: deliberately): write opinions using Mihkel Mut's image, cries on Facebook how terrible people live around them in Estonia, picturing, boycotting, jugglering, sabotage.
They agree to stay only in Echo Chamber (the English expression of people who live in a room where only their appropriate opinions, such as their own Facebook friends, etc.), but this is not possible in conflict in Estonia.
There's still some sidewalker who thinks or does something that can't be tolerated by the echo people.
And there's a war on the ground, and there's a lot of cheerleading.
We have a lot of politicians who know exactly how many people can drink with whom to sleep, how many children can be raised, how to work, how to get a lot of pay, when to rest, what to think, what to eat, how to separate themselves, when to be sick, how to die.
In very important places.
If their public speeches are reflected in something other than what they themselves said, they are angry, offended, hysterical.
The fact that people in many European countries drive a "total" car, and that is allowed by law, does not shake their opinion.
Zero tolerance is the only tolerance allowed in every place, but behind zero tolerance is not care, but sinister.
Classical anger and racism - only people like me can do it.
Holy politicians can only open their mouth, but never their heart.
They believe that every "action" they take to make society better works and is worth trying.
Fortunately for them, we have the illustrious clatters of the security forces of a sufficient size, the cactors with mental disabilities, who jump through every window without feeling pain.
Therefore, it seems to us that a clever peasant opens his mouth and is emotionally injured in a manor for it, that it is reasonable.
Some of the words that surely send us to the mansion are, for example, homo, refugee, woman, violence, and work.
If you believe everything self-serving officials, activists and politicians (such are only a small part of all groups, but they are able to gloat in such a way that society as to complain) speak and write, the citizen is not only disgusting, lame and unpleasant, but also brainless, without a brain.
But let us not believe, do not force us to tolerate, do not forbid us to drink.
In any case, the Estonian person drinks as much as he wants, not as much as the state promises.
In any case, the person of Estonia tolerates more than he is forced to tolerate.
A person in Estonia does not change his behaviour two months before the elections to turn his back on his popularity diet after the goal has been achieved, and again out of his mouth not only, but also to launch what makes unpleasant brain fat kgs quickly restored.
Whoever does it differently is not the right Estonian.
I don't think any people can be reared.
I think it's possible to teach a person.
Drink sensibly, love your family, be a laborious, polite, attractive companion, not only for friends, but for society as a whole.
To teach, you don't always have to be fined, restricted, banned, forced, put in order, cornered, and throw eggs in the media shame mail.
The teacher must set an example.
A smoking politician talking about tobacco harm?
A police officer who's overspeed in his spare time is gonna fine me for crossing speed?
And then you get caught in the head by a colleague...
I have such a clever idea that maybe we should try to rearrange the ruling class once and for all.
Tell them not to drink in secret.
If you drink, drink publicly: In the Town Hall, under the eyes of all the people.
To force the speed to exceed only publicly - the drivers' cars, including private cars, all red.
If you rule, rule as you rule yourself.
Maybe it'll be a shame if words and actions don't come together.
Or we'll know that we want the most parched ones to rule us.
Because all of us, the Estonians, are what we don't want to be.
Where to run from yourself?
The leaking of Trump Transcripts is probably a federal crime, according to former prosecutors.
The person who leaked the wiretaps of telephone calls between President Trump and foreign leaders to the press was likely to commit a crime, on Thursday, the former prosecutors argued when the legislators called the defendant.
"The unauthorised disclosure of these documents to the press is a crime," said former Columbia District Attorney Joe diGenova Fox News.
These different acts, which include the disclosure of notes and scripts of talks between the President and foreign leaders, constitute a serious threat to national security.
On the basis of the documents leaked, the Washington Post announced on Thursday new details of Trump's intense calls with the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
In the first place, Trump ordered the Mexican Head of State to cease the public declaration that his government would not pay for the border wall.
According to the newspaper, the Transcripts contained notes indicating that they have been classified by the Supreme Commander of the National Security Council.
The Post said that they had been reached with comprehensive scripts, which had been "assembled by the White House's staff" based on the records of the White House's notebooks.
"There is a federal legal provision that makes leaking such classified information to an unauthorized person a criminal offence, a federal crime," said former New York Public Prosecutor Doug Burns in his phone interview.
Although some of the details of these calls came to the public already in February, the disclosure of the Transcripts points to a much greater blow to the White House, which is trying to reduce the leaks.
The report was published by chance at a time when the management figures of the Trump Administration were preparing for a strong public response on Friday to demonstrate their commitment to the grubbing-up of classified information leakers.
Chief Prosecutor Jeff Sessions, National Intelligence Director Dan Coats, Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, and Head of the National Centre for Reconciliation and Security William Evanina are expected to inform the public at the Department of Justice's headquarters.
It's not clear if the Ministry of Justice is investigating The Post leak.
In order to be held accountable for this, Burns says that "secure elements must be clearly proven".
He said, 'There may be a lot of mischief on this subject', referring to the investigation and decision of the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's e-mails.
These considerations include the markings and history of the document and its precise classification.
In the case of confidentiality, the prosecutors shall examine whether the document was leaked to an unauthorized person in a way that negatively affects the interests of the United States of America.
"If all this can be proven, people can undoubtedly be criminally vulnerable," Burns said.
"No doubt."
When talking about Trump's phone records, DiGenova, a spy case prosecutor, said that such documents are usually classified as "secret and higher".
While claiming that these leaks were jeopardising the ability of the United States Government to pursue foreign policy, DiGenova appealed to the D.A.'s Attorney General to summon a federal criminal jury to find the leakers.
He also said that in order to receive the records of the phone calls from the Washington Post reporters and editors, a court order should be presented - something that the reporters would undoubtedly protest against.
Senator Mike Lee, Utah Republican Senator, said on Thursday that there should be a criminal procedure for leaking classified information.
"We need to find the person who leaked them - they need to be punished and fired," said Lee Fox News, "Americana's News HQ."
"This is unacceptable and this should never happen."
Lee, who worked as a lawyer before being elected to the Senate in 2010, said that this kind of leak is a "crime, a very serious federal crime".
"This act should not and should not only be accompanied by dismissal, but also by criminal proceedings, given that classified information is involved," he said.
Fox News was told that, at this stage, the Ministry of Justice's Friday announcement could rather give an overview of what the Ministry of Justice hopes to achieve, not explain certain procedures.
Last week, President Sessions was criticising and publicly pouring his anger on the D.A.'s attorney general, claiming that the latter had not made enough effort to find the leakers.
"I want the D.A. to be much harder on the leaks from the security agencies," Trump said in the rose garden on 25 July.
The sessions themselves last week admitted to Fox News Tucker Carlson that he was not satisfied with the efforts made to investigate leaks which, since his inauguration, have repeatedly raised obstacles to the President.
"I have not been satisfied with the previous procedures and investigations of criminal leaks," said Sessions.
Even some people who are critical of the President have spoken against the leaks, saying that this behaviour is detrimental to foreign policy aspirations.
"The leaking of a speech between the President and the head of foreign affairs is unprecedented, shocking and dangerous," said David Frum on Thursday in Atlantic.
"It is extremely important for the President to be able to communicate confidentially - and perhaps even more importantly, that foreign leaders understand that they can reply confidentially."
Senator Mark Warner (D-Va), Head of the Senate Security Committee, also told The Daily Beast that the leak is "absolutely" worrying and that Congress should investigate it.
10 low advertising tricks to make food look more attractive
Since many foods are difficult to photograph, the picture uses a different ingredient that is cheating people away, for example, instead of milk, a potato powder or ice cream.
The YouTube Channel Top Training provides an overview of the tricks that are quite common in the advertising world.
If someone opens a popcorn box in a commercial or takes a hamburger out of the box, a lot of good steam will come out.
In fact, the practice is longer, and throughout this period, no hot food is steamed, as steam comes from a high water content that, for example, is not available in pastry products.
Therefore, there are water-soluble cotton balls in the packaging or in the food, which have the ability to absorb and store their own water.
In close proximity to the heat exchange, they steam much longer than a burger or a popcorn, and the product receives a freshly prepared appearance.
Potato powder is a great assistant to photographers because it does not melt in light or heat or significantly change the consistency like many other foods.
For example, instead of a cream filling or ice - frozen ice cream, the cake may be a potato cake.
A little color and decorative elements, and the consumer is once again deceived.
The glue replaces the milk.
Milk is not easy to photograph, either, because it may not look so white on the photo.
Foods served with milk are also rapidly becoming bumpy inside.
For example, as morning flakes or mussels need to look crispy and delicious inside the milk, a glue is used instead of a milk that does not pass through any of the flakes.
If restaurants can work hard to make meat so that the result is soothing and yet ripe, it is not done by advertising.
Yet, the meat presented in advertising looks particularly tempting, as it were from the grill.
Often, however, it is cooked on a finished pan or made in the oven, and strips that imitate grilling are drawn to the meat.
It's just as difficult to work on the cream as it is on ice cream, because it tends to melt.
Fortunately, there is a product that is almost identical in appearance to a foam - peeling foam.
So it may be in advertising on cakes or berries or in milkshakes.
Even on the surface of the fruits sold at the store, there may be a thin layer of wax that makes their appearance more shiny.
However, this is not enough for the photo, and a deodorant is sprayed to add the fruit to it.
Also, the sauces are not photogenic because they become more liquid over time or are released from water, for example.
But here comes the help of wax, whose bright colors and more permanent texture allow you to make a tempting image of appetite.
The wax is also likely to have been used in those pictures where the melting chocolate flows on top of the cake or ice cream.
If you notice a cake with the perfect cut in advertising, where the relationship between the bisque and the filling is perfect, there is probably some extra layers or pieces of cardboard used.
It's because when you cut the cake, you can spread the lice and ruin the picture.
If, after cutting, the cake is pushed into the pastry and sprayed with a filling, it makes it look more beautiful visually.
The cardboard and button needles are also used inside the burger in order to make sure that all the ingredients are correctly located there.
That's why the burger on the table doesn't look like a commercial.
Paper stuffed chicken.
Advertising looks like ovens and juices, but it may not even be ready for cooking.
To add a full impression, the chicken is stuffed with paper, sanded if necessary with the potato powder mentioned before, and then sprayed with a brown color.
Pancakes are particularly poured in American commercials with maple syrup because this image creates a huge amount of pancake in people.
In fact, the cakes absorb the syrup quickly and the flowing syrup disappears rapidly under the eyes of the photographer.
Therefore, each pancake is sprayed with a cleaning device for the couch, which helps to avoid rapid absorption.
There is often no help from it, and so the gold brown engine oil, which is poured on warm pancakes and presented as syrups, is used instead.
Former soldier sentenced to sexual abuse for the murder of a suspected pensioner
The former soldier was sentenced to at least 17 years in prison for the murder of a man he suspected of mistreatment of a woman he knew.
Richard Cassidy (70) was convicted in June of the murder of David Farish (75) in his home in Tweedbank, Roxburghshire in February 2016.
Judge Lord Summers called the murder "especially brutal" because there were 14 stab wounds in the victim's body.
As a defense lawyer, Brian McConnachie said that the killing was caused by "temporary madness", but he described circumstances as "extreme".
Cassidy heard that Farish had sexually abused a woman for a long time.
His lawyer said he went home to Farish and "friended" him hoping to hear a confession, not to kill him.
Lord Summers claimed that Cassidy demonstrated signs of intent on the day of the attack and pointed to a social work report which revealed that the defendant had undergone military training on how to infiltrate groups by means of a friendship.
There were no charges against Farish.
The court reported that, after the murder, Cassidy contacted the police himself and turned himself in.
McConnachie said that most people have a "hard to understand" that Cassidy is capable of murder.
The defense attorney said: "He has never had a problem before this incident.
He lived a full life until this crazy moment in February 2016.'
Cassidy's health is said to be poor, and he's been captured with a heart attack and stroke.
According to Lord Summers, he took into account, with a minimum of 17 years of imprisonment, the fact that Cassidy had no previous convictions and what was allegedly told to him about Farish.
The Scottish police described this case as "a particularly wretched murder of a fragile old man at his own home".
Detective David Pinkney said: "Although this punishment does not render his cruel act null and void, I still hope it offers David's family some kind of solution."
On Monday, the last opportunity was to propose a great name for the rhino’s tail, born at the beginning of June.
The zookeepers now have a huge box of names to review to find the right one to solemnly declare on the birthday of the zoo on August 25.
The name can, however, be given to the sons of bitches until the day of independence.
From the beginning of August, the whole rhino family is at the same time walking in the yard.
And while Father Kigoma occasionally runs around and moves his horned gardenposts, his mother does not let Kibib disturb herself, but his rhinostacks get a good lesson.
Although the high times of birth have passed, on August 1, you saw the light of the weather in the jacket and two goats in the house.
On the golden mountain, on a warm summer day, you can get caught in a bunch of hot eagles.
The takinas, the goates of a peculiar appearance, began the run.
On Thursday another Vivacolor day took place at the zoo.
A large number of good help painted the new camel house, the mother - in - law garden posts, and the father - in - law terrace.
In order not to interfere with the colorers, the female elephants Fien and Dray spent time with the father - in - law Carl.
On August 9th, on the second classic day of the zoo, Aavo Otsa will appear in the trumpet.
In memory of the animal, it is possible to obtain a krues and other fine memories with rhinos and skins.
The benefit of the charity will go to the support of the respective species conservation project.
On the tiger day last week, more than EUR 1000 was collected at charity sales.

"The European Union's food labelling standards allow the packaging to identify the quantity of carbohydrates and sugars that are not equivalent to the quantity of white, so-called table sugar," said Krista Kalbin, the marketing director of Valio Estonia.
According to her, milk products actually contain three types of sugars: milk lactose, natural milk sugar, fruit glucose and fructose, and added sugar, or sucrose.
However, if you remember a couple of simple basics, according to Kalbin, the calculation of the quantity of added sugar contained in the product should not be difficult.
It must first be made clear whether it is a milk or an acidified milk product.
The average milk and milk drinks contain approximately 5 grams of natural milk sugar, i.e. 100 grams lactose per product.
In oxidised dairy products, yogurt or kephir bacteria have consumed some lactose during the oxygenation process and therefore, on average, lactose in the acidified dairy products is 3,5g/100g per product.
"For the purposes of calculating the quantity of added sugar, the first is to deduct lactose from the quantity of sugar", said Kalbin.
The quantity of sugar must now be calculated from the quantity of fructose and glucose derived from berries and fruit.
"In general, fructose and glucose tasted milk products have a fruit content of about 0.3 grams and in particular berry products of up to 1.5 grams per 100 grams", said Kalbin.
According to him, this simple calculation shows that the percentage of added sugar in berry yoghurts may be up to twice as much as the percentage of sugars indicated on the packaging.
In the case of lactose-free products, the situation varies slightly as it depends on the production technology.
Comparison of the most popular spa packages: out of the nightclub tickets to the sauna rooms
The mailman's consumer service compared the more favourable packages offered by the spas to one person for one night on 11-12 August.
"Spahotels have different levels and service choices, so one comparison only on price is very difficult to make," said the sales manager of OÜ Spa Tours, Mario Sau.
Compared to spa accommodation, it is evident that the prices of the most favourable packages vary several times and there are options for both a more demanding customer and a more modest holidayer.
For example, if a single passenger can spend 51 euros in a single room of Värska Spa with a buffet and breakfast and unlimited use of water parks, gyms and saunas in a single room in the town of Värska Spa, then a package of 287 euros will be paid to one person when visiting the Nuhimaa Manor.
It includes accommodation in Double Deluxe category room, breakfast restaurant in Alexander winter garden and a half-day spa package.
When choosing and comparing different packages, account should be taken of the fact that, in order to get the most favourable price, you should go on vacation with a friend or partner, because staying in two rooms is more favourable than taking a single room.
If, however, there is a desire to rest alone, the visitor will be provided with special single rooms and two-digit rooms for an extra fee.
If, in general, a non-sovereign passenger has to pay a fee of just €20 for being alone in a two-digit room, then more favourable options can also be found when compromises are made.
For example, in Fra Mare Thalasso Spa, Haapsalu, the package costs 86 euros for overnight stay in a single room, but there is also a more favourable option to stay in a two-digit room provided that in the event of a lack of space, someone else is visited by the customer in advance.
In this case, the price of the package shall be EUR 58.
It is worth being flexible to get the most favourable deal.
Package prices are dynamic, i.e. they depend on the day of the week and on performance.
"For the most favourable package prices can vary from 112 to 248 euros", explained Triinu Steel, the sales and marketing manager of V SpaaHotel in Tartu.
He also pointed out that their hotels have a variable price, depending on their performance, and added that the customer generally receives the most favourable price by booking directly from their website or asking for the offer.
Since the summer period is the fastest on the spas, it is worth planning for a holiday in time to avoid the situation where the desired place has been sold out.
For example, on 11 August both Pärnu Hedon Spa and Strand Spa have been selected for the package comparison and only the suites have been sold at the conference hotel and the Vihula Manor in Lahemaa has also been sold out.
You don't have to look for opportunities to spend a relaxing holiday: almost every major city in Estonia has one or even several spas.
At the same time, it is worth examining before buying a package, and at the same time no major events are taking place in the vicinity, as this will increase prices immediately to the ceiling.
For example, until 11-13 August, there will be events in the White Lady in Haapsalu.
At this time Haapsalu has a lot of tourists, the demand for accommodation is very high and we have the prices for major events at this time.
"This is why we do not have discounts or discount packages for sale at the time," said Irene Field, Director of Laine Spahotel.
The Chinese company that came to Estonia last year immediately made a turnover of EUR 100 million.
The Chinese-owned farmer Agritera, which only started its operations last year, reached almost EUR 100 million in turnover.
A profit of nearly EUR 2 million was earned, says Business Day.
The company's annual report shows that the sales revenue of Agritera OÜ for buying-in and wholesale agricultural production amounted to EUR 100,6 million in 2016.
A profit of EUR 1,91 million was earned.
One year earlier, there was no economic activity in the company.
On average, the company employed 3 people last year, and there were no employees in 2015.
The turnover per employee amounted to EUR 33.6 million, with an average gross fee of EUR 316 per month.
Jüri Kolk: rest throughout the year, so you wouldn't need a rest.
Of course, it was my fault that I missed my vacation.
I guess I was a little needed, too, but I guess the only person who thought I was irreplaceable.
It's my fault that my stupid sense of duty spread in my chest.
The quote at the beginning of this column is fine because it is entirely true.
So there was a new office that I started in March of the same year, but something about the job was so much better for me that I recovered from a whole new life in three months, I took a break.
It's still summer, it's vacation time.
It's time to give the New Year's Promises, to review what's happened in life and where this whole thing is going.
"It's Christmas and the New Year's Eve for this," now some decent citizen screams badly.
Maybe it is, but we all know from our experience that Christmas is not suitable for thinking about life and setting goals.
All right, all I'm saying is for me - I can't make any changes in the year shift.
It's too hard for me.
Of course, there is happiness and joy in Christmastime: I like to know the beginning of the light race, I like the Christmas lights, and Jesus was also a very pleasant, revolutionaryly-minded fellow.
Nevertheless, I am usually very tired during Christmas and sometimes stressed out because of this very darkness.
Yeah, I do a lot of work while I'm on vacation, maybe more than I do in some fucking slaughterhouse, and I've been resting all the time.
Most of the time I've been running like a squirrel in a bike before Christmas - gifts, at least four Christmas parties, a little higher load at work...
Considering the constant pressure of society to experience unconditional joy and peace in the heart, the challenges of Christmas are evident.
But a desperate and tired person cannot make good decisions for a long time.
These things need to be done with more or less clarity.
A tired person may blow up an empty and eloquent promise that will help to lay the foundation of the future, about as much as buying a lottery ticket.
A promise that is intended to change something should be thought through calmly, it should be of benefit, it should be a plan.
The plan, unlike the promise, includes not only a policy but also a policy, and will not be broken after a few minor setbacks.
That's why I say the best time to make promises is now, in the summer.
You just need to rest out calmly and ask why it is as much fatigue as it is (if it is).
If you do not have the duty of waving like a calf that has escaped the table during your vacation, it will be enough for a couple of weeks to find a hook in your life that deserves a straight twist and to figure out how exactly this is done.
I think it's important to live as long as I can, so I don't need to take a vacation on a regular basis, not once a year.
So that vacation would be extra navigating, not a box stop needed to survive, during which time enough will be loaded to withstand the next year somehow.
I recommend at least one simple summer promise to all of you - if you have to get up at a certain time the next morning, go to bed early.
I believe that if one in ten Postman readers would follow my recommendation, life would be considerably better in Estonia.
I'm going to follow my own advice.
We already have a Thursday work week, but not what we expect.
Open office.Photo: Scanpix, PantherMedia / Wavebreakmedia ltd
Many Estonians already have their Thursday working week, which they do not know.
But not as they would expect, says Business Day.
This has been created by modern workspace planning, or an open office.
According to Harvard Business Review, employees spend nearly 1.5 hours a day, or almost a full day of work a week.
However, if four working days and three rest days are considered during the Thursday working week, then such a forced solution will be worse than that.
The 1.5 hours taken from working time are decorated with concentration difficulties, confusion of work, increased irritation and anxiety, and death of work, instead of leisurely or on leave.
The third festival day of the Weekly is being sent by a strong wind.
That's how the camera eyes of the evening paper were faced by a wretched echoer who was trying to fly the wind in the trolls.
Because of the windy weather, many festival visitors also say that the mouth and eyes are full of sand.
How a man built a theme park that cost his daughter 51 million dollars
A father in Texas discovered that there was no theme park where his disabled daughter could play.
So he decided to build one himself.
Gordon Hartman had just come out of the pool on family vacation when his 12-year-old daughter Morgan approached other children playing in the water.
He tried to make friends with them, but they quickly left the pool.
Hartman thinks they got scared because they don't know how to treat a disabled person - Morgan has a five-year cognitive understanding and also a certain form of autism.
That incident was haunted by him.
"Morgan is a wonderful young girl.
Seeing him always brings a smile to his mouth, and he certainly wants to hug.
But there have been many times where we haven't been able to take him to different places," he says.
Hartman and his husband Maggie asked other parents where they could take their daughter - somewhere where she would feel comfortable and others would also feel good when they were communicating with her.
"We have come to the conclusion that there is no such inclusive place," Hartman says.
It therefore decided in 2007 to build it itself.
The former real estate developer sold his home-building companies in 2005 to establish the Gordon Hartman Family Foundation, a non-profit association that helps people with disabilities.
He then began the creation of the first theme park, which is the most accessible in the world.
"We wanted to create a theme park where everyone can do everything in which people with special needs and no special needs can play," said Hartman.
He invited doctors, therapists, parents, and other disabled and disabled people to consult with the facility.
They were set up in a ten-ha-long abandoned career in San Antonio, Texas.
The park, Morgan's Wonderland, paid $34 million ($26 million) and was opened in 2010.
The attractions include a fully accessible view wheel, an adventure playground and a mini-train.
Visitors often tell Hartman that they were only able to experience such attractions for the first time.
There is also a carousel, which is specially designed for wheelchairs, which move up and down alongside animals.
Hartman says, however, that Morgan was scared of driving at first.
"When we opened it, he didn't dare go into it.
He didn't understand why it was going around and why the animals were moving up and down," said Hartman.
It took me three years to get Morgan to go to the carousel.
"At first he was just standing close to it, then he sat on the animal, but we didn't start the ride.
It was a slow process, but now he likes to drive it.
Getting over something that scared him meant a lot to him.
Playing the small things achieved makes a big difference."
Since its opening, Morgan's Wonderland has been visited by over a million people from 67 countries and all 50 American states.
A third of the staff are disabled, and entry is free of charge for anyone who has a condition.
"I realized Morgan was one of the lucky ones because he has many things he needs.
I didn't want the price to be an obstacle to other people with special needs," Hartman says.
"We open every year, knowing that we will lose at least a million dollars (750 000 pounds) and we will have to earn it back with the help of the repairs and partners."
This year the theme park was expanded by opening up Morgan's Inspiration Island, a fully accessible water park.
"In July, fewer people visited the park because the wheelchairs became too hot.
So we decided to set up a water park," Hartman says.
In some parts of the island, warm water has been used to help visitors with muscle problems.
Watertight motorised wheelchairs, operating with compressed air rather than batteries, are available.
It's also possible to ride a boat on the river.
The water park cost a total of 17 million dollars (13 million pounds).
"A man came to me yesterday in Inspiration Island and just held my hand," Hartman says.
"He pointed out to his son, who had severe special needs, and began to cry.
He said that his son had never been able to play in the water before."
According to Hartman, three out of every four visitors with disabilities are not three parks, and the park has exactly the effect it hoped for.
"This helps people to understand that although we are different in certain ways, we are actually exactly the same," he says.
"I saw a girl in a wheelchair going to another girl who didn't have any special needs and they started playing together.
That was really awesome."
Hartman has no intention of opening more parks, although he has received hundreds of letters by post and e-mail from people who would also like to go to the park next door.
Instead, he focuses on the provision of educational facilities for young people with special needs in San Antonio.
"I know there are many different organisations that are trying to build something like Morgan's Wonderland elsewhere, and we will continue to work with them," he adds.
He's still taking Morgan to the theme park with him - Morgan's kind of a celebrity now.
"When he comes here, he's like a rock star!
Many people want to talk to him and take a picture with him, he can handle it well," says Hartman.
Morgan, now 23 years old, is getting better and better.
"He's talking more now, and most of his physical problems have resolved with numerous operations.
We're so proud he's come this far."
When Morgan visits the park, he likes to play on the rocks and on the sand, no wonder how much he's helped others.
"Morgan knows that the park has been named after him, but I don't think he understands what it really represents and how it has changed lives," Hartman says.
"He doesn't realize that how he has dealt with things in life has made him a real source of inspiration."
U18 Master Coach Vaido Rego: Play-off game can be decided by one or two shots
In Estonia's U18-age basketball club, the home EMI B-division was defeated in the quarter final of Poland 68:63, according to the head coach Vaido Rego, it was a real play-off meeting.
The game was crazy.
Both teams had done their homework, points came hard.
The game comes with a situation that's got better nerves.
Play-off can be a one or two throw game", discussed Rego.
You can win, but the coach's always looking for something to fix first.
Nuriseda always does.
Some of our mistakes were not justified, the opponent received light free throws and lived on them.
This has happened before - if you are going to protect aggressively, there is a risk of overburdening.
We draw our own conclusions," Rego said.
He used nine players today, and Robin Stone, who missed a few meetings because of the injury, was still on the bench.
These decisions are made on a rolling basis.
The stone carried out morning training and pre-game warming, but was still not 100% ready," explained the supervisor.
Tomorrow at 6:15 p.m., the Estonian semi-final will meet with Britain, who today defeated Bulgaria 76:73.
The winner of this game will raise the country's U18 age class by the next summer's EM A division.
Video: Vassiljev has already created another penalt for a new club
Piast was already defeated by the ninth minute of the home field against Wroclaw Slask, but he was able to slice 20 minutes later.
Vassiljevil had a great opportunity to secure the first victory of the season for Piast.
Four minutes before the normal time of completion, the semi-protected penalt was missed.
The match ended with 1:1 pins.
Piast has collected two points in four rounds and is placed in the league on the last or 15th.
How do you keep sex exciting when you're trying to have a baby?
So it is very important to keep the kelechek down even when you are trying to create a new life.
Female First gives advice on how to make it so that sex does not appear to be an annoying obligation.
Don't take it as an obligation
This can happen to any couple who are trying to get pregnant.
Sometimes it takes years to get pregnant.
The order after sex takes away spontaneousity and romance.
Try to be spontaneous!
Women often feel that they cannot enjoy the "normal" sex at the end of the cycle if it is known that there will be no positive result.
This creates tensions in relation to the relationship, which in turn leads to a reduction in sex, and less sex, of course, means an even greater chance of not getting pregnant.
Men, however, feel that they must be able to "play" when they are required to do so.
If you know your fruitful days ahead, it can be helpful for you to plan something more romantic.
Whether it's a special dinner or just spending time together - enjoy each other!
Consider a fruitful period.
From the point of view of reproduction, there's no point in having sex when the ovulation has occurred, but in order for your relationship to be noble, try to have sex for the sake of joy in non-fruitful days.
Although there is no evidence that pregnancy is more certain than a woman can get an orgasm, do not forget it!
Remember, each couple is different.
Everyone can handle baby-making stress differently.
Some men want to be familiar with the woman's cycle, while others prefer not to know that they do not feel the pressure to "supervise".
No one knows better than you do how best for you.
Find your solution!
Studies have shown that couples who have sex every few days, but not every couple can hold such density.
The most important thing is to find a pattern that suits you best as a couple.
IAAF warns that fraud is being watched in the London World Championships.
On Friday, the world championships will start in London, and athletes will be in more ramp lights than ever before in connection with doping canals.
These world championships are the first to be guarded by the new body, the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU), which also monitors corruption, gambling and counterfeiting of results.
"It is not possible to rule out that the nature of people does not allow such things to happen.
We can say, however, that we have the best practices and the best anti-doping programme that can be at the moment based on information and data collection, and we can see the result after the event," said David Howman, the representative of AIU.
AIU has allowed 19 athletes to compete as neutral athletes for around 190 Russian athletes caught in drugs.
Reversible: Levadia destroyed the Paide City Team on the home field
Levadia has put herself in a difficult position, because in the previous round, the alien was surprisingly lost to the future of Viljandi, and the table leader Flora took advantage of the opportunity offered by slipping to seven points.
But Nõmme Kalju has reached the same stick as Levia.
During the summer transition window, Paide continues to miss the captain and the central court of Andre Frolov.
Of the last seven games, only two pin points have been picked up, the eighth is in the league - from Tartu Tammikas four points down and from the future four points in front.
In the first game between Levadia, Paide lost 0:7 and 2:5 this year.
"My watch died, but I didn't," the actor Raivo E. Tamme had a wide smile in the face of Ironman 70.3 finish.
True, throughout the half-long triathlon, the smile never left Raivo behind.
Moreover, as he ran 21 km, he had a conversation: "I talked to one person during the run, a man ran by, and wondered, "Lord, you can talk again!"
On the run-out, Raivo, who had the energy to tell, went a few times to the fast-track.
On the coach's recommendation.
"Ain-Alar Juhanson said that you can walk uphill, that there's no point in pushing you to run, because there's such rises here, and it doesn't really matter whether you're running or taking a fast walk," says the actor that took advice from the triatheist.
He was also able to breathe at the time of his walk, and therefore, even after crossing the finish line, he was able to share without breath left and right interviews.
As if there were no 1.9 kilometers of swimming behind, 90 miles of cycling, and 21.1 kilometers of running.
"I think that my workout is such that I can enjoy this competition," says Raivo, who started training in January and lost 16 kilograms of his body weight to this day.
And as far as interviews are concerned, it was my wish that I could do the interviews after the finish.
After every competition, I've been able to give interviews, and I was hoping it would be nice to be able to do it even after Otepää Ironman.
I thought it would be all right if I wasn't on the ground after Ironman." On the contrary to the aggravating state-in-the-land presence of Raivo, when crossing the finish line, Raivo offered a different picture: his hands triumphantly towards the sky and his face a sincere triumphant.
There was also a reason: It took 1.9 km of Raivol to swim for 46 minutes and 24 seconds, 90 km of cycling for 3 hours and 32 minutes and 21 km of running for 2 hours and 18 minutes.
"My heart is now given to a triathlon," confirms Raivo, who already called out in the finals that he gave the sport a finger and it took the back of the ring.
Already registered on August 20, in Gran Fondole - 230 kilometers from Tallinn to Tartu with a bike!
So practice again tomorrow!
Disney's long-time advisor and head of Marty Sklar died at the age of 83.
Sklar, who died in his home in the Hollywood Hills neighbourhood of Los Angeles on 27 July, maintained ties with the company after retirement in 2009, due to the 54th anniversary of Disneyland’s opening.
Last year, he became the only member of the troupe on the opening day of Shanghai Disney in China (so the company invites its employees) who has participated in opening all 12 Disney parks around the world.
And less than two weeks before his death, he attended the Disney fans' meeting in D23, sharing memories of Disneyland.
The Disney Company reported her death without mentioning the reason.
He was 83 years old.
Sklar's post as editor of The Disneyland News was temporary, but he returned to Disneyland after graduation of U.C.L.A. in 1956 to work in its advertising department.
He soon became the main shadow author of advertising material, dedication, souvenir leaders, calls, slogans, presentations and short films, such as a book that helped the company to gain approval for the construction of Walt Disney World and Epcot in Central Florida.
He also worked with Walt and his brother Roy on the Disney annual reports.
"These were quite head-to-head times for a person who was nearing his 30th birthday and had only six or seven years of college graduation," Sklar wrote in his autobiography "Dream It! Do It: My Half-Centre Creating Disney's Magic Kingdoms" (2013).
However, despite the fact that Walt Disney trusted Sklar in the literature, he assigned Sklar to Ford at the New York World Fair in 1964, where Disney Company designed exhibitions and attractions.
Sklar wrote Walt Disney a story about Ford's pavilion attraction for Magic Skyway, where he could see animatronic dinosaurs and cavemen, which was their main link to large corporate sponsors.
It was the start of Sklar's second act at the company.
As a member of increasing importance and leader of Imagineers, he was increasingly associated with Walt Disney's legacy, who died at the end of 1966 long before Walt Disney World was opened in 1971 and Epcot was opened in 1982.
After Walt Disney died of lung cancer at the age of 65, Sklar looked back at the writing world when he was told that the company's management staff had not prepared a public speech, although "it was not a secret that Walt was dying", as he wrote in his autobiography.
Sklar was disappointed that he had to write a statement signed by Roy Disney, but he realized that the lack of planning was a sign that Walt Disney's death had paralysed the management of the company.
"In fact, they were all scared to death," Sklar wrote.
Martin Adrian Sklar was born in New Jersey in February.
His father, Leon, was a teacher and mother, a maiden named Lilyn Fuchs, worked for Johnson & Johnson before the family moved to Long Beach to California when Marty was 12.
After high school, he had several temporary jobs, for example, he worked at Douglas Aircraft, as an ice cream company at the hamburger restaurant, and as a parcel driver for postal services.
But in May 1955, when his third year at the U.C.L.A. ended, Sklar received a message calling Disney's marketing and advertising director E. Cardon Walker.
At the time Sklar was the new editor-in-chief of the student paper The Daily Bruin.
Walker asked him to attend a job interview for the creator and editor of The Disneyland News.
Walker said the theme park was about to be opened.
And it needs him.
Walker hired him after a 20-minute interview.
Sklar, however, had to prove to Walt Disney that he knew what he was doing.
"I've been working there for two weeks and had to submit a paper concept to Walt Disney," he reminded me of on the Disney Avenue Web site.
"If Walt didn't like it, he'd have kicked me out the door and hired a professional.
But fortunately, Walt liked it.
I was 21.
That was scary.
I'd never worked professionally."
Sklar format Walt Disney (and some other people) lessons at one point "Miki for Ten Commandments", or the theme park board manifesto.
The commands include, for example, the following: Feel your target group.
Try to "enter visitors' shoes" to experience an attraction like them.
Only one story at a time for each attraction.
The theme entertainment expert Bob Rogers once called Sklar a "venture student" - the role Miki-Hir played in Disney's "Fantasia" (1940) - because he had mediated Disney's philosophy to three generations of designers.
His wife, Leah Gerber, Leslie Sklar, his son Howard and four grandchildren, is left behind.
Sklar was Disney's dedicated leader.
He regularly wore a three-piece Miki-Hiire watch (which showed him the time of time in Los Angeles, Paris and Tokyo) and a Miki-Hiire gold ring.
And he never forgot anything Walt Disney had taught him.
When Disney Company developed a children’s area of California Adventure Park, Sklar reminded planners that they would add to the activities that parents and children could do together, as Walt Disney had demanded.
"I reminded everyone that Disneyland existed at all because Walt used to drive his daughters to Diane's and Sharon's Griffith Park with a fur case," he said to The Los Angeles Times in 2002, "and Daddy had to sit on a parking bench and eat peanuts and popcorn while the kids were driving alone."
Police took over 200 people to the county during the Weekly.
In total, more than 20 crimes were recorded in Pärnu City during the festival days.
There is reason to associate some of them with the music cabinet, with the use of violence being accompanied by a large amount of drug possession and two drunk driving.
A hundred of the misdemeanor proceedings initiated were mainly related to the incubation or possession of minors or prohibited substances who consumed alcohol.
A letter was received from a thief and a violation of public order.
For various reasons, police officers brought over 200 people to the police station.
About half a hundred of them were minors, and mostly the reason why they moved to the police station was alcoholic beverages.
I had half the minors brought in for me.
A half a hundred people were also taken to Kainenema, perhaps as much as in the previous year.
Andres Sinimeri, head of the Pärnu Police Department, said that given the large population, the above-mentioned figures are expected.
As in previous years, we were thoroughly prepared for this weekend.
We combined additional forces from other prefectures, police cassettes and auxiliary police officers to ensure that they were ready to react quickly.
Most of the situations were resolved with a word and enough of the interaction of the lawkeepers with the citizens.
"It is obvious that there were no such things as a few bad deeds, because the police were in town to see and to feel enough in our opinion," said the Sinimeri.
In his view, it was extremely positive that the underprivileged drinking of alcohol was apparently less, and the young people proved that there could be a sounding.
He thanked the top-level security company team for taking care of security at the festival.
I thank all the festival guests who were politely up and having a safe party.
"I would also like to thank the local people who contributed to the success of the big festival with their understanding attitude," said the police chief.
At Pärnu police station, owners are waiting for items found in the city and festival on the weekend.
According to Annika Pärnu, who was responsible for restoring the findings at the Festival Hall, this year's loss of items was less than last year.
In the festival police tent, more than half of the findings were returned to the owners.
The greatest loss of bank cards, identity documents, mobile phones and keys was made within three days.
"At present, 13 more mobile phones, three wallets, laptops, noodles and several car keys are waiting for the owner at the station," Pärnu listed.
A 101-year-old man jumped off a plane.
World War II veteran Verdun Hayes recently received a military award to celebrate the paratrooper jump that broke his world record.
For the first time, a man committed a violence of 101 years and 38 days of age, thus becoming the oldest person in the world who committed a paratrooper jump.
The Group is pushing the government to agree on the transitional terms of Brexit.
One of Britain’s largest business lobby groups encourages the government to stop dancing around Brexit’s outskirts.
The Institute of Directors (IoD) appealed to the Government to conclude a "transition agreement" to make progress with Brexit smooth.
It is desirable for the government to transfer the "Brext salmon" bridge between leaving the EU and establishing new trade agreements.
The group warned that, without such a contract, business would be faced with "short-term chaotic fluctuations on the edge of the rock".
They criticised the government for being involved in "transition in all kinds of speculative disputes".
In recent weeks, members of the government have expressed conflicting views on how long the transition period will last and what it will bring.
IoD's report on "Speeching the Brext salmon - possibilities for transition" states: "In order to communicate the problem far away, the government must reinstate a strategic debate on this issue.
This could minimise the growing confusion and uncertainty in this area."
Gerard Lyons, an economist and a group of Economists for Brexit leader, described this week's concern about the "cold edge fluctuating" Brexit as "the story of pancreatics", which reminds Y2K computer program failure in the millennia shift.
Vice Chancellor Philip Hammond warned in June: "There is a large number of business investments that are postponed until companies see more clearly the likely outcome of these discussions."
Allie Renison, Head of EU Trade Policy and EU Trade Policy, said: "The Chancellor has the right to worry about the delay in business investment.
This is one of the most frequently observed changes to the EU relocation of operations that need to be addressed in relation to Brexit.
The latter shall apply in particular to IoD members in Northern Ireland who are currently considering a co-location or relocation."
IoD offers a number of options, including the following: extension of the Article 50 agreement from March 2019 to
Accession to the European Economic Area
Consent to stay in the EU's legislative area
Establishment of a transitional customs agreement similar to the EU Customs Union
Renison said: "IoD offered these opportunities in connection with the transition, hoping that it would bake a proper debate on how best to complete Brexit.
Prioritising intermediate arrangements and thereby mitigating the risks of exit from the EU means that short-term chaotic fluctuations on the cliff edge will not diminish future opportunities."
Russian railway investigates the possibility of launching St Petersburg-Kaliningrad-Berlin passenger train
Russian railways are investigating the possibility of crossing the Berlin-Peterbur train line through Kaliningrad, the director of the Kaliningrad railways informed Viktor Golomolzin Interfax Severo-Zapad.
The monitoring of passenger traffic indicates that, from an economic point of view, it is hardly possible to restart the trains of Kaliningrad-Berlin.
And we offer a second route to Berlin-Kaliningrad-Peterburi.
Technical options for this are available both in terms of infrastructure and rolling stock," said Golomolzin.
Golomolzin also noted that there are already Russian trains that can change the rail gauge and continue to move on to the European rail gauge.
Golomolzin believes that this direction is perspective, because at the moment, the inhabitants of St Petersburg and the whole north-west of Russia have to travel to Germany through Moscow and Brest.
As a possible option, the route will be discussed in Latvia, and the Latvian railway (Latvijas Dzelzceřš) was confirmed by Māris Ozls, a spokesperson of Latvia, who said that there is no specific decision at the moment, but the option is under discussion.
The Latvian railway, together with its partners, including Russia's railways, is looking for an opportunity to increase competitiveness in passenger services so that rail transport can compete with road transport.
Pakistani prices can't find asylum in India
After 70 years of the greatest population migration in the history of separation from the two countries, prices continue to move from Pakistan to India.
Tens of thousands of people, who do not even have the legal right to work in India, are waiting for them in the gypsum camps at the border between two countries.
Therefore, many have no choice but to scrape illegally near temporary habitats in the cracks of stone - the Indian authorities on the other hand are watching the movements of the cross-border aliens from a very steel point of view.
Most of Pakistan's arrivals do not expect such reception.
No job, no house, no money, no food.
There we worked in fields, we were peasants.
This is where people like us are forced to break stones to earn a living," said 81-year-old Jódas.
It's not over for us.
The Hindus are still trying to return to their country.
And when they come here, they have nothing," added an elderly man living in a field camp near the town of Jodhpur.
After India’s independence from the British colonial power in 1947, over 15 million people lost their homes.
Dissolvement caused a monthly wave of violence in which at least one million people lost their lives because of religious hatred.
In the midst of the bloody chaos, the Hindus and Sikhs were banished from Pakistan, but the Muslims were moving in the opposite direction.
Despite emigration, prices remain one of the most numerous minority groups in Pakistan.
According to different estimates, they account for about 1.6 per cent of the country's 200 million population.
Many of them complain about constant discrimination and fear of kidnapping, rape and forced marriages.
"Failure began soon after the separation", said Johdas, whose family moved only a few months before the two countries split up to escape the drought to the current Pakistani territories.
Not a day has passed since we could have lived in peace.
I wanted to come back to live among my Hindu brothers.
The Indian Prime Minister Naredra Mod's national government has said that he wants to make it easier for religious persecutionists to find asylum in India.
Last year, the government began to enable immigrants to apply for citizenship at their place of residence, earlier the whole of the business was through the central government.
The Hindus who have relocated from Pakistan to India will open up the possibility of gaining a high-speed citizenship after seven years of residence.
However, due to bureaucratic delays, this process is often much more time-consuming.
A 64-year-old Khanaramji left Pakistan in 1997 and became Indian citizenship in 2005.
However, he said that many have given up and returned to Pakistan because they do not expect a good life in India.
The government doesn't offer any support.
We're like cattle without the owner.
We're just trying to survive ourselves," Khanaramji said.
But the scepticism of the authorities is even worse than poverty.
Those who do not have citizenship must suffer the harassment of intelligence agencies.
They are always treated as suspects and Pakistani agents," he explained.
Singh Sodhal, a charity committed to helping the Hindus from Pakistan in Jodhpur, had in 2014 come under great expectations of Mod, but has now had to be disappointed.
During the Modi regime, tensions have increased between India and Pakistan, which is why migrants suffer most.
"The lives of these will become hell," said Sodhal.
For many, such treatment is better than life in Pakistan.
Horoji and two grown - up sons fled to India two years ago because of the threat of murder from his Pakistani neighbors.
"In order to save our lives, we had to flee to India," said 65-year-old Horoji, whose grandparents were from the present Indian territories, but found themselves disintegrating on the wrong side of the border.
My grandfather moved to the other side for work.
But he told us to move to India at the right time because he knew that the future could be dangerous for the Hindus.
I think we've done pretty well.
We have done well with our work and work," says Andres Sinimeri, the police director of Pärnu, says how they have had the first two days of the Week.
The Blue Sea says that even today, there are police officers and fast-acting people on the streets, and they also communicate with people - perhaps they have questions and they also want to know how to become a fast-track responder.
In two days, the police have had to deal with some fights, including drug cases.
"There have also been some treatment of a large amount of narcotics, but we'll sum up when the Week's over," says the Blue Sea.
About a hundred people have been through Pärnu’s police station for two days.
Fortunately, the police didn't have to solve extreme cases.
By the way, the Blue Sea says that if there is a sudden and horizontal rain coming from the sky, they don't have much work to do.
One of Haapsalu's police officers has ever said that rain is like an extra patrol.
Pärnu police have also made a staff in the Weekly area, where you can take the things you have found, and there you can also demand your lost things.
By the way, the police have even lost one of their necessary gadgets that good people have delivered to the invention.
Look at the video Andres said to the Sinimari Nightpaper.
Several of Emmy's embling scientists and producer Neal Baer paid $4.35 million for a home in the West of Hollywood Hills, which has its roots in the atomic age.
In 1945, the modernist style of the building was designed by Josef Van der Kar in the middle of this century, and it was named the Wohlstetter house by its original owners, Albert and Roberta Wolstetter.
There are wide glass slides on the 255-square-metre-side of the entranceway with gates, which open to the garden, terrace and inner courtyard.
The living and dining room has a cork floor cover, a fireplace and transferable panels that open in the kitchen.
The main part of the house consists of three bedrooms and three bathrooms.
There is also a separate guest house on the property, where a view of the giant fish pond and the sleeping balcony is opened.
There is also a separate bathroom and additional storage room in the building.
Albert Wolster was a powerful nuclear strategy during the Cold War.
Roberta Wohlster's analysis of intelligence incidents also quoted the Committee of Inquiry on 11 September, prior to Pearl Harbor's attack.
The Wolstetters have advised the Presidential Administrations of both Republicans and Democrats, including John F. Kennedy during the Cuban missile crisis.
They got the President's Medal of Freedom from Ronald Reagan in 1985.
Baer is the most well-known for his work in television dramas "Framework Hospital" and "In the name of the law: Sex Crime Investigation Unit".
Real estate brokers were Mike Deasy and Sara Clephane from Deasy/Penner and Partners.
The buyer was represented by Hattie Ramirez from Keller Williams Realty.
The plane drew the perfect image of itself above the United States.
The pilot took the plane to the Sisacic nationwide flight over the United States and was able to even have some fun along the route.
In real-time aircraft flight data indicated that it was not just a straight line or curve but a series of flight routes that formed an image of the aeroplane together.
According to Flight BOE004, Flight Flightradar 24 left Boeing Field Airport at Seattle local time at approximately 15.40 p.m. on Wednesday.
Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner took direction from the east over Montana, North Dakota and Minnesota before radically changed the course and flew southwest.
From the map, the strange route of the aeroplane is a two-engine passenger aeroplane.
Boeing says the flight is part of the 18-hour "responsibility" test of the aircraft.
"In order to fly any pattern, the testing team released its imagination by en route, of which there were 787-8 contours in 22 states," said Boeing Company's representative to the RT.com portal.
"Dreamliner's nose points to the Puget Sound area, where Boeing Commercial Airplanes is home.
The wings extend from North Michigan to South Texas near the Canadian border.
The tail touches Huntsville i Alabama," he added.
Boeing's long-distance aircraft, 787-8 Dreamliner, was introduced in 2009.
The aeroplane can accommodate up to 242 passengers and can fly more than 13 600 kilometres.
As the pilot used the radar as a personal canvas, the flight created an enormous interest among the aircraft monitors on the web.
Some suspected that it was a test flight, while others suggested that it might be a strange coincidence.
Multifilm affecting the dress style of Estonian children
If, like children, in Europe and America, the children of kings or celebrities often shape what they wear, the parents of Estonia choose their clothes on the basis of what happens in the quinoline.
The British little prince Georg is about to become a fashion guerrilla, like the mother, the Duchess Cahterine.
Like his mother, the prince can fire people with his clothes a true buying madness that has even gained its own concept - the effect of Prince George.
The last such adventure took place a few weeks ago at the royal family's visit to Poland, where George wore a blue-red stripe of ten euros in the Spanish brand in Tizza, which was bought by the crazy parents from the brand's e-shop in 24 hours.
There are probably not many shoppers from Estonia, because the lateness of the king's children is said to leave our parents completely cold.
Anna Ansmitt, Communication Manager of the Chamber of Commerce, notes that children of star couples and foreign fashion trends in general do not affect our parents' purchases to their Mudis.
In Estonia, shopping for children’s items is the largest guide for films, cartoons and YouTube channels.
Thus, the most popular products in recent years are fingertips, multika "Frozen" characters games, dolls, clothes, dancing dogs or cats, peel penguins and so on".
At the same time, he confirms that, if he wishes, his children can be dressed like European princes or princesses.
The Central Party does not recommend the Savisaari ready-made alliance
The leaders of the Central Party regions across Estonia made a public and political appeal, calling for a vote by the Central Party and not by the electoral associations.
In particular, this message is meant for those who consider Edgar Savisaari's electoral union and the Central Party.
How Princess Diana used her makeup as a weapon
When I think about Princess Diana's make-up, the first thing I see is the eyeliner.
A girl at the age of younger, blue.
Later a thick black line in his "Panorama" interview of Martin Bashir, whose effect was devastating when he looked up through thick eyelashes, bringing to hearing an immortal phrase: "We were married in this, so it was a little too popular."
The large and wet eyes surrounded by his blemish, pale in the face with a thick black line, left him to the impression of an injured animal.
That's the effect he was trying to achieve.
Outside the public, however, Princess Diana never wore particularly makeup, at least not according to modern standards.
It was not just that he didn't need it - he was of course beautiful - but he saw an annoying obligation in it, something that was more about work than pleasure.
In front of the public, he could have worn a thick layer of makeup.
On one occasion, he arrived at the conde nasti, the Vogue publishers' office, carrying a thick, almost orange masonry cream.
He said he was sorry, saying that his skin would have to shine like the sun was shining, because if he went out "normally", then the masonry photographers would take pictures of him, and then they'd make all the charges that he looked "unpleasant", "drunk" and "tired".
This is why Diana went to the solarium three times a week using a machine in her home.
Today, for health reasons of course, such a course of action would be bad, but for Diana this was a useful purpose – it enabled her to show the world her solar nature, even though her interior was filled by black clouds and lightning.
One of the most likely faults in the royal family was to think that if they approved him as Charles’s husband, they would have a beautiful little cousin with a brain only with a sugar coat.
But the reality was quite the opposite.
She didn't have to be the best in the school class, but if it was about creating an image, she was a five-year-old student.
For Diana, the hair and makeup were important in the fact that they could be used to convey moods or hours.
Otherwise, they were of no interest to him.
His friend Rosa Monckton - Diana was his youngest child’s godmother - remembers that makeup was nothing they used to talk about.
"I only remember that," he said, "how relieved he felt at these times when we went out together and he didn't have to make his makeup."
Today, we tend to think of makeup as something that improves the appearance of a woman, but looking back on Diana’s life - cycle, it is clear that she used it as a powerful tool of relations.
The moments in which he felt the most freely were his own, the moments in which he was also the most natural, wearing very little makeup.
In 1993, with his two young sons in Thorpe Park, he was wet and laughed at in front of his eyes like any other mother who spends the day with children.
Four months after he and Charles were reported leaving, he finally looked wretched and "normal".
Or later in the years when you quit the training hall, your hair set back, your feet in the form of bicycle pants, your face reddened from your workout, your health and your vitals blowing out of each of his pores.
Toward the end of his life, when he began to pay for his independence and his confidence grew, we saw more and more Diana.
He tied up with Halo Trust and walked through Angolan mine in January 1997.
At that time, at the age of 35, hair soft and natural, face almost completely undressed, he probably looked more beautiful than ever before, remembering this shiny and hopeful young girl who smiled at the engagement photo 15 years ago.
Diana was just about to get to her best years.
In the early days, young Diana Spencer had a dream pre-Raffael nature.
But it didn't take long to start "princessification" - a process that was dominated mainly by the press and the palace to make Diana a refined young girl who would be worthy of her new position.
Part of it included Clayton Howard, a veteran makeup artist, often used by Lord Snowdon for photography, handicraft.
Howard first met with the jealous Diana at the Kensington City Hall in Snowdon to capture an official engagement picture for the magazine Vogue.
At that moment, in the late 1980s, Diana was just an empty canvas.
His finest beauty products were from The Body Shop, such as Elderflower's eye gel.
Howard used Max Factor's make-up cream with Sheer Genius tone Honey Touch and Max Factor's cheekstick tone Frosted Coral.
To his eye holes, he wore Elizabeth Arden’s tones Rice and Timberland and a white bead - shaped table color on the brow.
Elizabeth Arden’s blue eyelash and blue convex improved the appearance.
And we know all this because Howard created a facial for him.
"Diana's eyes are such a wonderful color that I wanted to emphasize their glamorous blueness," she wrote later.
But the end result is not particularly attractive for a young girl like this - she looks like an 18-year-old who's about to get 50.
Her brows are too pressing and too much boring brown on her eyes.
But the most striking thing is the evil eyeliner on the inside of the eyelid in the blue tone of the Disney Princess.
The fantasy for the fantasy bride.
No wonder Diana looks at us with some uncertainty.
One of Diana's sources of anxiety was the fact that she never knew where the public person would end up and start private.
It was the beginning of this process.
The person who most likely influenced Diana’s appearance was Mary Greenwell, who still plays an important role in the world of makeup today.
The make-up artist, who is now a member of Chanel among others, is still one of the icons of the make-up world.
"Diana had incredibly beautiful skin and long limbs," she recalls.
"He was just beautiful.
The men adored him.
He was sexy without trying."
Mary met Diana for the first time in 1991, when Vogue's then mainist Anna Harvey asked her to make Diana makeup before the December photo session with Patrick Demarchelier, one of the most prized photographers of the magazine.
The crew also belonged to the hairdresser Sam McKnight.
This happened when Diana and Charles had the biggest marital problems and started bickering for public support.
"They didn't tell us who it was, although we knew it was someone very famous," Greenwell said.
"When we got there, Diana was just standing there beautiful and warm and friendly and extremely excited to be on the front of Vogue."
This cover picture - Diana's simple black sweater, the chin resting on her hands, her blue eyes bright, on the nail elegant French manicure, her hair cut short - was a fracture.
It radiated positiveness, individuality, and elegance.
Above all, it was modern, conveying the minimalist aesthetics of the early '90s and creating a strong contrast between Diana and the royal family, facing the 'dose of Horribilis', as the Queen later called it.
"Diana was very tense about her makeup.
He just wanted to look fresh and different," Greenwell said.
Over time, he taught Diana herself to make up - cream, makeup cream, a hideout to raise the eyes, eyelash - and stressed the healthy skin care routine, encouraging her to take good care of herself and to follow the mantra "indwelling beauty".
Diana "did everything moderately," says Greenwell.
He slept well enough and reduced the consumption of alcohol, which is very important for skin that looks fresh.
The princess preferred Guerlain's makeup cream, Clarins' lipsticks and Clinique's Wild Rose cheeks.
But the biggest favor Mary did to Diana was her alienation from the blue eye wave.
"It just made him so much older," he said.
Instead, he used a combination of soft brown and neutral tones with a brown pencil line on a ripple line that was melted together, so all the edges were beautifully soft.
Often, she used just a ton of cream and some sunscreen to highlight Diana’s health.
"Diana used to call me and invite me to discuss the products I really liked doing," Greenwell told me.
"I think it was relaxing for him; the opportunity to take a few moments for himself."
His favorite was the luxury brand Clarins.
Diana allegedly used day- and night cream for their sensitive skin and cleaning milk and toner with their Alpi herbal plants.
He also visited the beauty salon of Janet Filderman regularly in facial care.
Diana had a famously beautiful skin, but sometimes she had rosacea, moderate cheek rash, often caused by stress.
To mitigate this, he used natural calming oils, including kibble oil.
"Diana had an amazing bone structure," said Greenwell.
The only part of his appearance that he was not very confident of was his nose.
Anna Harvey recalls: "One time when the papers wrote that she had been in beauty surgery with her nose, she turned to me and said laughing, "Truly, if I had let my nose be operated, do you think I would have chosen this?"
When Mary Greenwell and Sam McKnight’s advice began to stick together, Diana felt increasingly confident about her new appearance.
One of his most memorable public appearances - in 1994, in the Serpentine Gallery in London, where he was wearing a famous "premium dress", an invoking, bare-tailed figure-emphasizing copy of Christina Stambolian - shows that a sign of the end-years of his life began to develop.
With short hair and hair over the ears, Diana is both sexy and dynamic, her short hair sharp contrasting with a very challenging black silk dress.
His makeup is perfect - attractive, but yet modest, black eyeliner highlighting the blueness of his eyes.
Without fear of bright colors, especially red, he wore a glowing fire - red nail polish, probably Revlon Red, which then became a brand in some sense.
A few months later, he flashed his elegant red manicure fund for child loss at the Royal College of Nurses.
The princess was in a state of health and self-assurance.
And finally he had full control.
In a modernized and form, his makeup is flawless, he conveys exactly what he wants the viewers to think: here is a woman who seems to have at last a sense of self and purpose in life and who, finally, after having just 36, has found her place.
It's a shame he couldn't prove it to himself.
Southwest Japan is preparing for the taifun Noru arrival
A large part of South-East Japan, including the areas affected by the rainfalls last month, was preparing for even more rain on Friday than typhuun Noru, which was one of the strongest storms in the world at one point this year, moved ever closer to the main islands of the country.
According to the Meteorological Office, a little south of the island of Kyushu and some 1,350 km south of Tokyo hit the Amami archipelago on Friday’s south with strong winds and plenty of rainfalls, and over the next 48 hours it is possible that rains will fall up to 800 mm.
A representative of the Meteorological Office said that Noru, which marks a certain type of deer in Korean, is likely to turn north and cross over Kyushu by rain, although the northern parts of the island, hit by rainfalls and floods that killed 36 people and left four people missing, are likely to escape the worst.
"This is a very slow-moving storm," he added, pointing out that there is therefore a greater risk of flooding, because there is a lot of rain in one region over a long period of time.
Noru, which was one of the fiveth category of typhoon and is an unusually long-lasting storm, first formed two weeks ago and traveled the circle along the North Pacific before heading to the Northwest, targeting Japan and weakening its approach.
The representative added that, depending on the change in the course, Noru can travel directly through Kyushu and then along the island of Honshu in Japan, but it is still difficult to identify a longer-term journey.
There are places on the ground where, if necessary, conventional vehicles are not easily accessible even at their best wishes.
There's the solution to the ATV.
The ATVs used in the military area gave an overview of the Defense Home!
There is nothing new about the use of such light-weight and good-transmission vehicles in military structures.
The need for them emerged already during World War II, but more attention began to be paid to them ten years later.
Simplitude and strength
As early as 1956, M-274, known as the mechanical mule, rolled out of Willys Overland - a vehicle designed to evacuate the wounded during the late years of World War II.
It's a little strange to call mechanical mule the truth.
It's hard to imagine a more ascetic vehicle.
Wheeled platform, seat and steering wheel: everything, full luxury.
It's as if the too much designers on the engineer's desktop had hit the drawings too hard and started production.
But in the war, there is much more permeability than comfort.
There was no match for mules tested in this category in the Vietnam jungle.
Hardly, a light machine weighing less than five hundred kilograms was able to pass through those places where even the mythological famous Willyse Jeep, with his super-transformation, had to show the performance of the brake lights.
Most of the vehicles with a load capacity of about 500 kg were used in transport operations, both for the transport of ammunition and for the transport of vitality.
At other times, lighter, non-return-free anti-tank weapons were also installed on the mule.
The driver was able to move the steering system forward in the last trouble and let it be so low that it was possible to drive the vehicle lying on the stomach.
The mules were manufactured up to 1970, together with 11 240 of them, and were used in the army until 1980, when the victory was replaced by HMMWVs.
For the next two decades, ATVs had more marginal meaning in military circles.
They came back to the picture after the two towers of dust fell in New York, and U.S. soldiers found themselves in the desert landscapes of Iraq and Afghanistan.
That's where the knowledge and understanding of the need for something to fill the gap between the Humwee and the infantry.
As the ATVs do not generally offer significant protection, they are not the best choice to perform the battle tasks directly.
However, quick and light machines are suitable for special tasks.
For example, even intelligence and rescue operations.
There are now thousands of ATVs and UTVs in the American army.
Most of them, such as the XUV550d acquired for the Defence Union, are essentially similar to those of civilians, but supplemented according to the needs of the army.
The names of Kawasaki, Mule, Hondalt Rancher and Foreman, Yamahalt Rhino and Arctic Cat, as well as the ever-experienced choice of the leading military-ATV manufacturer Polaris, have been represented from the brands which had received the falsification.
In 2013, Polaris signed a five-year agreement with the American Special Forces Centre (SOCOM) for the supply of two-seat MRZR2 and MRZR4 and a five-year agreement on MV850 on the basis of a single-seat Polaris Sportsman, which has both infrared and black-out lamps and innovative bee-like tyres to ensure mobility even after the 50-calibre gun hit.
Prior to the entry into the market of MV850, Polaris was able to supply vehicles to the military, MV700 and MV800.
MV700 is the military version of Polaris 700cc Twin Sportsman, accompanied by winches, a two-part fuel tank for major distances, a reinforced frame and base, and some military equipment that does not allow farmers or those who are in the same forest to start up.
As well as the Polaris ATVs successfully used in Iraq and Afghanistan by John Deere M-Gator, it is equipped with armaments, luggage-resistant hood and some other elements that are useless in ranches, but necessary in the battle zone.
A vehicle weighing 750 kg is capable of carrying almost its weight division, that is, 570 kg of stuff.
The power of the engine is also sufficient to carry lighter retro-reflectors and cannon parts.
The variable shape box in the rear of which the sides can be removed allows the luggage of point A, B, which is larger than the dimensions of this small but small insect, to be driven from the point A.
Later, the completed versions of M-Gator A1, which are 20 horsepower more powerful than the original 20 horsepower M-Gator, and the subsequent reinforced A2 frame, which is even better for carrying and towing difficulties, and A3, which combines the positive characteristics of A1 and A2.
In fact, the M-Gators were already awarded in 1997 and 1998 to Bosnia, where the medical hybrids used them to evacuate the wounded.
At the same time, they also reduced the load of soldiers on their own feet by carrying items that would otherwise have to be carried on their backs.
If most of the ATVs used in propulsion structures are modifications to the vehicles used for civil use, there are also some exceptions.
The most outstanding of these are war knights named Prowler in Phoenix International, which have been successfully used in all possible battle, intelligence and rescue missions around the world.
According to the manufacturer, for their first time ten years ago, they have been introduced and transferred to vehicles designed to carry out specific operations, which are characteristic of normal ATVs and also of those that have been modified for the army, with a view to both conductivity, resilience and safety.
Being externally similar to ordinary ATV, Prowler is totally different in terms of both its design and its capacity.
He is faster, more durable, more stable and able to carry both after and with greater difficulty than other similar vehicles.
For example, if, in the case of normal ATV, the driver has to play continuously with his body position in order to maintain the balance of the vehicle and use both hands for manoeuvring, acceleration and braking, the driving of Prowler is more like driving the car.
In the end, however, it doesn’t matter whether Prowler, Gator, MV850 or some other concept of ATV or UTV, and the scope of use is similar to that of all of them.
And it is clear that, in circumstances where a wide range of defence expenditure is being reduced, and instead of a large-scale conventional war, small-scale, target-oriented skiing is being practised, light - weighted and fast - speeded small vehicles have joined the army to remain in service.
As a result of the department's prophet, sensitive data on vulnerable children were published
As a result of a worrying violation of information, the mother of one child was misguided with the personal data of the dependent children, including information on whether they are sexually active.
A table was sent to the mother containing the names, date of birth, location and specific concerns and places of attention of all children under the care of the large service provider operating in Victoria.
The e-mail revealed every child's place of residence.
The list states that one 13-year-old boy is released from bail and in the case of him, that one 15-year-old girl with problems with self-injuring, abuse and running of certain substances is "out with a boyfriend" and "no return tonight", and that one 14-year-old boy needs help with "sustaining" and is verbally aggressive and physically threatening.
The table appears to be a transfer document intended to be sent to the night shift supervisor.
The document contains notes on when there are some children waiting for home or whether they can contact the staff to follow up.
Some children have been given worrying details.
As regards a 15-year-old boy, it has been written with caution: "If a person contacts to obtain permission to search the room and/or review the laptop/USB device due to the suspicion of inappropriate sexual material, this authorisation must be granted."
The document also states that in the case of a 17-year-old girl who receives only three months from 18 and is released from the care facility, the risk of suicide is so high that, when she escapes, the personnel will have to call the emergency line immediately.
Regarding a 16-year-old paroled boy, it was stated that he was out and "to contact the staff later to catch up with him".
However, although only the name of the accommodation where the children are kept and not their addresses has been mentioned in the listed places, the details are sufficient to allow them to be found.
The 2015 data leak emerged when Mother shared her experience with Fairfax Media in relations with the Ministry of Health and Services and Child Protection since her daughter was taken into care four years ago.
He agreed to share his concerns now that his daughter had become 18 and left the system.
The heartbreaking decision to hand over your daughter to child protection was taken after a violent incident at home. This case is one of the more and more family violence complaints that parents are making against their children.
For example, within six months of his departure from home, his daughter was able to receive seven criminal charges, he moved hundreds of miles away to home and to an olympic where he seemed to be able to cope successfully, but then he was moved back without informing his parents, additionally accepted and facilitated the relationship between his daughter and the older man.
The relationship with the first of these boyfriends, 17-year-olds, with whom the caretakers allowed her to stay regularly at the local hotel at the time of the 15-year-old daughter, ended when a young man was accused of having sex with the child a few days after he was 18 years old.
"Why did she leave the system in a worse situation than when she entered it?" she asks.
"And does it happen to all the dependent children?"
He strongly advocates the establishment of a body that would allow the Ministry of Health and Services to monitor children during the first weeks after they are taken into care before they are moved to their homes.
This would enable them to better understand how children communicate with others and what their risks and their needs are, especially in educational terms.
The State Government is looking for new ways to reduce the need to place children in home care, inter alia by seeking to better support their parents.
The aim of targeted assistance packages, financed over four years by $62 million, is to help children move from home to better-organised situations.
In addition, the EUR 5.6 million two-year experiment, which was published last October, allows professional carers to offer at least 28 children to help them get out of care or avoid getting into it.
According to the department representative, the information leak was not officially reported when it occurred, although the mother claims that two members of the department were informed within a few months of the incident.
The department is now working with the service provider to analyse the case.
"All alleged private data leaks are being taken very seriously. We are working to ensure that it has not negatively affected the young people concerned."
Last July, Jenny Mikakos, Minister of Family and Children, commissioned an independent review of the sample of child protection privacy incidents that took place during the five-year period.
The department agreed to the seven recommendations as a result and has since renewed the Child Protection Code to ensure that the staff clearly understood their roles and privacy-related activities, changed IT systems to prohibit the automatic pooling of certain personal data, and formally reviewed the activities related to the privacy of the department.
Australian bank Commonwealth Bank accused of extensive money laundering offences
On Thursday, the Government of Australia charged the State's largest mortgage to Commonwealth Bank for widespread violations of the anti-money laundering and terrorist financing rules.
The Financial Intelligence Agency AUSTRAC has announced that they have initiated proceedings before the Federal Court of Justice against Commbank for 'serious and systematic non-compliance' in Australia's largest case of its own and in the first case in which a large bank is accused.
"Commbank's behaviour in this respect has left Australia's society vulnerable to serious and persistent financial crime," said the AUSTRAC Court of Justice.
Commonwealth Bank stated in its statement that they would investigate the accusations more closely and respond to "if the time is right".
The largest mortgage lender in Australia did not "in due course or at all" report the suspicious facts that "in total transactions of over USD 77 million (US$61 million)".
According to the Agency, the Bank has committed 53,700 acts against money laundering and terrorist financing, particularly in relation to so-called 'smart payment machines'.
The previous largest case of this type was related earlier this year to Tabcorp Holdings, the most popular bookmaker in Australia, who had only 108 alleged violations.
Tabcorp paid $45 million in fines and is the largest civilian punishment in Australian corporate history.
The AUSTRAC representative refused to comment on the possible punishment of Commbank or whether there could be other banks on the Agency's line of fire.
The maximum penalty for non-compliance with the law against money laundering and terrorist financing is 18 million Australian dollars per infringement.
Intelligent payment machines are a fixed type of ATMs that accept cash and cheque payments and facilitate anonymous cash payments.
According to AUSTRAC, the use of Commbank’s intelligent payment machines has increased significantly since their entry into force in May 2012.
The cash contributions amounted to 5,8 billion Australian dollars in the six months preceding June 2016 compared to 89 million Australian dollars in the first six months after CommBank’s ATMs were launched.
AUSTRAC submits in its case-law that cash contributions were made under counterfeit names, so that revenue was received from import syndicates of drugs.
"Even after Commbank's attention was drawn to suspected money laundering or "smurfing" in Commbank accounts, Commbank did not start to monitor its clients in order to make money laundering and terrorist financing difficult and manage," the court documents show.
AUSTRAC added that Commbank's accounts were also used for "cracking". It is a form of money laundering involving transfers between countries without actually crossing international borders.
Nordea and DNB will become reality at the end of the year
The merger of DNB and Nordea to Luminor of the Baltic entities will take place only in the last quarter of this year, says Business Day.
The opening of the doors in the common legal body has been increasingly delayed.
Following the disclosure of the accession plans last summer, the banks indicated that the completion of the transaction could remain in the second quarter.
In April, however, the DNB's communication manager said that the matter would be postponed to the third quarter.
In particular, the Swedish Financial Inspectorate gave further instructions to Luminor to comply with the regional importance of the joint bank.
Trump called it a "narkourka" by New Hampshire, making state politicians angry.
"The President was wrong," said New Hampshire Republican Governor Chris Sununu.
It is disappointing that his misdescription of the epidemic ignores all the great that the state has to offer.
Senator Maggie Hassan, a New Hampshire i Democrat, called the comments "extreme" and said in Twitter that his state is no different from other people who are fighting widespread opioid abuse.
Senator Jeanne Shaheen, as well as a Democrat, agreed.
"It is totally unacceptable that the President speaks about NH this way," he wrote on Twitter.
It's a completely false representation of the NH and the epidemic.
Opioid dependence - a category of drugs involving heroin and fentanyl - is the most deadly drug epidemic in American history.
In 2016, an overdose of drug addicts killed more people than weapons or car accidents - based on the data analysed by The New York Times, it is estimated that 59 000 people - and is now the main cause of death for Americans under 50.
According to the Agency for the Abuse and Mental Health, more than 97 million people in the United States consumed prescription painkillers in 2015.
It is estimated that 12 million of these people did so in a way that was not appointed by the doctor.
New Hampshire has been hit hard and its residents repeatedly raised the problem to the presidential candidates during the 2016 campaign.
New Hampshire was estimated at 470 overdose deaths in 2016 compared to 439 deaths in 2015.
In 2012, according to the statistics of the Ministry of Health and Services of New Hampshire, these were 163.
On Thursday Sununu described the opioid epidemic in the e-mail as "one of the worst health crises the state has ever faced".
He said that the government has doubled the resources devoted to prevention, treatment and recovery.
According to him, the State has also spent millions of dollars on children’s prevention programmes, legal protection to stop drug trafficking and initiatives aimed at making the naloxone more accessible, which is used to treat overdose.
Call to find drivers in connection with the rape of two girls in Witton
The police are trying to find two drivers in connection with an investigation into the rape of a 14-year-old girl.
A teenager was attacked in the area of Witton, Birmingham, on 26 July around 02.00 (BST).
Before that attack, he was raped at Witton Station.
With regard to the first case, a man has been charged.
The British transport police would like to speak with two drivers as part of the investigation.
According to the police, the first car is a light-coloured sedan.
Detective Chief Inspector Tony Fitzpatrick said: "We have reason to believe that the driver of this vehicle spoke to the victim at the station before another person picked him up and then raped him in the car.
We would like to know what was said during this conversation, and the driver may also know some important details that would help us with our investigation."
According to the police, the victim was probably taken home after being raped a second time by another vehicle, which was described as a red VW sharan.
For this weekend, rains will be allowed to appear, so it would be time to take a proper exercise.
Why not trim your legs!
You're Gorgeous will share recommendations for nine exercises that should help you achieve cleaner and better legs.
Allegedly, the first changes should be seen after the first week of training!
Although the weekend has arrived, your activity has not diminished.
Still working with your hands and feet, trying to encourage other people to act swiftly.
You could forget your concerns and drive out with a more expensive one.
Take time for yourself to enjoy each other's company in some lame, romantic place.
Speaking of exciting things, you're going to go on fire, make big plans, maybe you're going to make promises... whichever way you think they're going.
The other party will remember what you said.
It's hard to focus on some kind of activity.
Your feeling may depend not on what is happening today, but on what has ever happened before.
You can also act quickly and rationally when faced with a difficult situation.
You may be helping someone out of trouble today because you have enough wisdom and determination.
Rather, stop worrying about money and business.
Take time to rest and relax.
Visiting a popular event can be exhausting, and it can cause nervousness.
It is possible that, by mistake, you will face a serious dispute in which you will have to strongly defend your views.
If the others cross the border, don't you do it.
You’ll feel better in a normal environment, doing things that you can and will be happy to do.
Apparently, you're not thirsty for new knowledge and adventures right now.
Fun is an activity that you probably never really get a taste of.
Today, you're in a company too.
What's happening at the party may not be normal.
In spite of the day off, you may still have to deal with work.
Or you'll be home physically, but you'll still be back at the desk.
If you want sharp experiences, travel can offer it.
In an adventure roll, you will have to get together to stay in balance and keep up to date with the wave brush.
Don't waste your energy arguing about money.
Only take this issue if the situation really requires rapid and decisive intervention.
Why do dogs eat lawns?
Sometimes it's thought that a dog eats drugs when he doesn't feel well and wants to throw up.
In fact, most dogs eating medicine are perfectly healthy.
Only less than 10 percent of dogs who bite grass do it because of some disease.
One reason why a dog may suddenly begin to eat grass can be a nutritionally poor food table.
Even dogs with worms may become more interested in chewing grass.
Therefore, if a dog who has not chewed the grass before has a sudden appetite for grass and often eats it, it is worth checking his doctor to find out, for example, the possible problems with the digestive system quickly.
It is worth mentioning that the dog can eat grass even because he likes it or if he's just bored.
If a health problem is excluded, it should be established that the family’s favorite can still be sufficiently developing and moody.
lightning clouds are coming from the West to Estonia.
In Northern Estonia, there have already been noises and individual flashes on several fronts.
This afternoon, the weather service also issued a lightning warning.
Today, mainly in Northern Estonia, there are many parts of the lightning.
The lightning clouds are moving quickly eastward from the west.
"The southwest wind outbreaks range from 15 to 18 m/s on the islands and on the coast, but the lightning can be accompanied by a stronger windshield", says the weather service website.
However, a much larger thunderstorm rages east of St Petersburg in South-East Finland and Russia.
Fortunately, however, the wind in Estonia blows from the west and the southwest, so at least there is no risk of the major storms turning to Estonia at least.
Sylvester Stallone will step up in the guest role of the series "Our Life" in the second season
The leading producer Dan Fogelman announced on Thursday, in the framework of a series forum at the Television Criticals Association press, that Sylvester Stallone would appear in the second season ahead of the NBC popular drama series.
As a guest, the actor takes up the role of Kevin (Justin Hartley) in filming at the beginning of the season.
"Kevin plays in a big movie and we needed a big co-star," said Fogelman.
At the end of the previous season, Kevin was hired to play an important role in a film screened by Ron Howard.
This season we will see how the character participates in the project and also warms up relations with his ex-husband, who is played by Alexandra Breckenridge.
Fogelman says that Stallone is playing "in the movie that Kevin's involved in".
The "Our Life" star Milo Ventimiglia, who plays Hartley's father in the series's past pictures, was a coincidence in the 2006 "Rocky Balboa" Son of Stallone.
Fogelman said that the still flourishing friendship of Ventimiglia with Stallone was probably what helped the show attract a big star as a guest actor.
"We have an excellent scenario for him.
I think it's gonna be really exciting," Fogelman said.
"Our life" will return to the television screens on September 26th.
Two elite university staff were arrested in the United States after the state hunt.
42-year-old Northwestern Professor Wyndham Lathem turned himself in to the police in California after the police had been looking for him.
However, a 56 - year - old employee of Oxford University, Andrew Warren, was captured by the police in San Francisco.
The men are suspected of being stabbed in the brutal state of Trenton Cornell-Duranleau, 26 years old.
He was found dead in Lathem's apartment at the end of the month in Chicago.
A few days later, suspects made a huge donation to a library in cash under the name of the dead.
Before we got to the police, Latham, a Chicago police officer, said he was sending a video to friends and family members about the biggest mistake of his life.
CNN didn't see the video and the police won't publish it.
According to the police, it was a brutal murder, and his body was transformed because of the wounds.
Warren had recently arrived in Chicago, Britain, but the investigators have not yet determined whether and how he was familiar with the victim.
Before the arrest, both suspects fled the state.
Elise Christie is talking about how she got over Sochi's horrors and cyber-twissing to re-swirl for gold.
Compared to this fragile young woman, who recently considered saying goodbye to the Uusitadione forever, the age of 26 has changed to the unknown of Christie.
Evil insults struck her feet, especially when she was a child when she was at school in West Lothian.
At the moment, he is packing up his confidence and believes that the trial can go back to the beginning with at least one gold in Pyongchang.
"I want to be the winner of the Olympics without a doubt," he says, without fear of specifying the goal.
"I feel I'm at the right point, both physically and spiritually, to deal with it."
At one time he dreamed of a career as a stellar until the aesthetic elements began to diminish this interest.
"I was a very good jumper, but I had trouble with the party who wanted the art," he said, laughing.
"I wasn't very good at elegance, in order.
It was a reasonable choice, because short-circuiting is best suited to my personality."
A woman walks around the globe, my daily budget is $5!
While giving the truth, I have also had such an experience, indeed for 40 days, where I decided to live the "sult" life in southern France just to be free and live the day at a time.
Got spent in tents, woods, small town stations, etc.
The second week I joined a French "homeless", 44-year-old man.
Oh, don't think that some kind of pedicure or something: We just stayed in the same park in Mentones and became friends, although he was 15 years old, he was a good socialist.
Turns out he's from a good family, Paris, ex-French Marine Officer.
I mean, I don't know. I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I don't really like it. I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I just...
In other words, I joined him, and the next three weeks we were wandering together, from town to town, and about 5€ a day for food money.
There's still a lot of money to live.
The man taught how to provide help at night in the terraces and on the roads of closed hotels and restaurants.
We've done just enough work for the next 2-3 days with food money and then...
At some point, I was in a fever, and I decided I couldn't take it anymore.
I took a flight to Helsinki, from there to home.
And by the way, I still regret it.
These 40 days must have been the best in my life.
In Indonesia, a man who stole three loudspeakers from the mosque was burned alive, the Hungarian news agency MTI is transmitting.
A 30-year-old thief snuck out of the mosque of the town of Bekas near Jakarta on August 1st, but the pilgrim noticed him and shouted, "Take the thief!"
They came to help, and they immediately followed the thief.
He escaped on a motorcycle and even swam across the river.
The chase lasted a few miles, then one of the rocks that were thrown by the pursuers hit the back of the head, causing serious injury.
The raged persecutors caught a thief and beat him up.
One of the chasers poured the thief's gasoline and set him on fire.
The innocent died of burn wounds at the scene.
The body was moved to East Jakarta Police Hospital.
The police took control of both the dead motorcycle and the stolen amps.
In the local press, reports initially appeared, as if it were not a thief, but an electric converter who wanted to repair the sound amps.
The police, however, had a decisive effect on these claims.
The people who died reported that they wouldn't make a statement about what happened.
According to the German news agency dpa, this step is due to the fact that Indonesians do not trust the police or judicial authorities very much.
Indonesia is the largest Islamic country in the world.
Of 255 million inhabitants, up 87.2% are Muslims.
Australian kitchen: from finger to school.
From the aboriginal people today, the Australian cuisine has inherited fingernails and chicken meat.
British roots have also had a lot of influence on the food table there, such as Vegemite, the salt-brown berry butter that is soaked with butter on bread or cream, reminds the British Marmite.
Meat pies, which are provided with boiled potatoes and sauce, are also from the British.
There are also British BBQ Snags, or raw sausages, which are cooked on a grill by the Australians, while the British are more in the oven.
One of the local sweet stars is Pavlova's best friend, although it is also called a invention by the New Zealanders.
Sweets are also loved with coconuts and oatmeals with crisps Anzac cookies, and with coconuts and chocolate cakes, mamingtons.
Honey Joys, or maybe one of them will be called honey cornflakes.

This autumn Stephanie will celebrate her 77th birthday.
His father was a state official, and his mother Mary loved food very much.
Stephanie studied library at the university and, as Australian young people used to study, she went to discover Europe after her studies.
In France, Stephanie’s love for food was merely a possession and a development.
In London, however, he met his first husband, Jamaican roots, Monty, with whom they, when returning to Australia, opened the Jamaican House, a simple place for meals in Melbourne in 1964.
Ten years later, the marriage broke down and the restaurant closed the doors.
In 1976, he opened a restaurant in Stephanie's Restaurant for a slightly more wealthy nation, which was one of Melbourne’s most valued dishes for the next 21 years.
We still talk about a restaurant of brand important importance as the first fine dining place in Melbourne, which really could appreciate fresh raw materials and offered seasonal food - a fact that currently seems to be an abie sister, but at the end of the last century it was not.
Since his retirement from the restaurant in 1997 Stephanie has focused on writing cookbooks, they have appeared from his feathers 15 years ago.
There are even more productive food writers in Estonia, but in his case no book has been simply a recipe collection.
Different Stephanie Alexander cookbooks have been indispensable to Australian cooks.
However, the lady considers the fifth cookbook, the supermind of "The Cook's Companion", which is now at least half a million homes in Australia.
The book was first published in 1996, completed in 2004 and the latest version in 2014.
In my bookcase, this is what takes quite a lot of space for the 2004 edition, because there are about a thousand recipes on the 1126 pages in an implicit book!
However, the latest option is even more extensive.

This is a real cooking pill, where, in addition to recipes, different raw materials are purchased and stored, cooking technologies are introduced and recommended for the purchase of food supplies.
Food is in alphabetical order, and there are many cross references in the work - obviously library education did not run down the side of the writer.
Stephanie herself stresses that it was this book that changed her life and gave a new direction to future affairs.
Because of the popularity of the book, he has a feeling that he has something to give people, led to the next large kitchen garden project, which in our circumstances is comparable to the school gardens.
The fourth person in Estonia received a heart in Finland.
According to doctors, cardio surgeon Günter Tala and cardiologist Pentti Põdra who participated in the surgery in Northern Estonia (PERH), the post-operative period has been expected.
"It's very hard to say how long a patient could have lived without a new heart," Põder said.
Doctors have confirmed that the world has been living with a heart pump for a maximum of eight years.
The man himself is still recovering and is not ready to discuss this issue.
He was diagnosed with heart failure for the first time two years ago, and the disease had already reached its final stage, and heart failure was caused by ischaemic disease.
"For this patient, transplantation was the only option," Tal added.
According to a cardiosurgeon, after the transplant, the patient no longer has the battery or the wire on the side with the heart pump.
He's only left with scars and immune - suppressive drugs.
The patient can make sport and generally live as a normal person," he said.
The first year is the most dangerous.
Põder added that it would take three to six months for a complete recovery.
Both physicians say that the patient should be closely monitored for medications; however, the medicines also have side effects.
In addition, the patient should be monitored to avoid organ rejection.
The most dangerous is the first year, but according to ISHLT, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, 50 percent of patients already live for more than 10 years.
Tal stated that the results were better in Helsinki and that 25 years had been transplanted for the longest time.
The cardio surgeon explained that since the disease caused the patient’s blood circulation to be poor, he was given a heart pump a year ago that helped to recover from surgery.
When the pressure on the man's lungs fell, he became a suitable candidate for transplant.
The transplant operation is not considered to be a very complex operation, according to Tal: it is very important that the timing is correct.
"It took a lot more time to get the pump and then get the heart when you put a new heart in it," he said.
In addition, the cardiosurgeon introduced the surgery as a complex part of the out-of-body discharge from the bloodstream.
Rather, he says that heart - moving can be considered as rare because it is the least that Estonians need.
A lot more kidney, liver and lung transplants are performed.
I mean, the rare operation still has excitement, but we've been practicing this job for many years.
Learning about yourself and your nervous system is one of the art in this profession," Tal added.
The body needs four more people.
According to the hall, the patient was given a heart because no other patient living in the Community of Scandiatranspland was eligible for the organ.
Scandiatransplant is an organ exchange organisation composed of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Estonia.
There are four more people in Estonia currently on the list of heart transplants.
"These are still numbered patients," Põder stressed.
According to Tali, big men with 0-positive blood groups are waiting for the longest time.
"There's a line for that in Finland for about six months," he said.
To get a heart, there are also a number of conditions.
"The heart of a woman is usually not suitable for a man, the heart of a great man for a small and so on," said the cardio surgeon.
How to finance company vehicles?
In a changing consumer society, the financing possibilities for companies' vehicles have expanded - more and more companies are also using full-service leasing or, rather, duty-free long-term car rental.
The leasing and rental of vehicles are two distinct financial transactions involving different obligations and expectations, but often create confusion.
According to Villi Translation, the Estonian Sales and Marketing Manager of the International Car Rental Company AVIS, companies are increasingly moving towards full service leasing and are increasingly using the long-term rental option.
The translation highlighted the main questions for which it is possible to choose a suitable way of using the vehicle when looking for answers.
How long does it take to use the vehicle?
The biggest difference between car rental and leasing is the time of use.
"It is worth choosing to use a longer-term vehicle if the company has a plan to use commercial vehicles for a longer period," the Translation explained, adding that it is worth deciding that it is in favor of a normal lease if the vehicle is to be owned for the benefit of a full-time lease or long-term rental if the vehicle is intended to be used as a service or a daily car, but leaving maintenance obligations to the service provider and so-called "departure".
"The rental car has a much shorter operating period than the lease period, but many major car rental companies also offer long-term car rentals, where car rental takes place without complex contracts and free-refunding", Translation introduced different car rental options.
Who will be the owner of the vehicle?
At the end of the usual lease, the tenant will be the owner of the car.
"In the case of full-service leasing, it is possible, at the end of the leasing period, to continue on the same or better terms with a lease payment, replacing an equivalent new vehicle that meets the needs of the company", he said, stressing that, since the consumer society is increasingly moving towards service-centred consumption, the ownership of the vehicle is an additional obligation for the company.
In addition, in the case of full service leasing, the option is also available to buy a car under agreed conditions.
However, there is no rental option and only pay for the period of use.
Car leasing usually takes place at car companies’ offices and renting a car from the rental agency of rental companies.
Although car companies' offices primarily deal with car sales, they also offer the possibility of leasing and, in some cases, car rental.
The rental companies, however, have the sole purpose of renting them out.
The translation said that the reasons for using the rental service are different - many companies hire professional vehicles, in addition, it is convenient to use the service when on leave or when their own car is repaired.
"In the case of official vehicles, the full service lease, offering the customer transparency of costs, timely savings in the purchase, use and recovery process of vehicles, and greater comfort", introduced the sales and marketing manager to the growing leasing trend.
Every year, more and more companies use full-service leases in their car parks, thus optimising their costs and focusing on their main business.
What is the coverage of service-based insurance?
In the case of a leased car, the car is usually covered by basic insurance and it is also necessary to decide whether to take more accident insurance, theft insurance or full insurance. "However, if you compare the normal lease with full service lease, the customer will receive more than the equivalent monthly payment, since in addition to the vehicle and insurance, the monthly payment will also cover regular maintenance of cars, round-the-clock assistance, tyre exchanges and other agreed services," the Translation explained.
"If any new vehicle can be included in the standard interface, in the case of full-service leasing, the service provider will help to choose a vehicle that meets the wishes and needs of the company, which also takes into account the functions of the use," he compared, stressing that full-service leasing will certainly help to optimise the costs associated with the company's car parks.
"The selection of passenger cars, however, depends on the rental car park of the service provider - different rental companies offer both small and economic vehicles in their own car park for urban traffic and luxury business meetings until the end of the year," said Translation.
Of course, during a tight period of rental, the car you want has already been rented out, but it is supported by an early booking of the vehicle you want.
When choosing between leasing or renting, first of all, it is necessary to clarify its objectives - how long is the wish to use the vehicle and what is the long-term plan for the car.
Certainly, it is also worth taking careful note of the different terms and obligations of the services.
At the press conference yesterday, Olga Ivanova, a member of the Riigikogu that joined Edgar Savisaare's electoral union, said that the electoral union called Savisaare will offer the Central Party a healthy competition in Tallinn during the autumn elections.
How likely, though, is Edgar Savisaar's cooperation with Urmas Sörumaa Election Union "Acts Tallinn"?
The U.S. Navy veteran was ordered to remove the envelope representing the American flag from the mailbox.
The difference between the United States of America's veteran and Florida's homeowners' union is in the middle of a rolling dispute with the American flag covered in the mailbox.
Erus U.S. Navy Officer John Ackert says that he received a letter from the Tallahassee Southwood Housing Community Association asking him to remove or face punishment in a envelope representing the state flag from the mailbox.
He told the WCTV he wasn't gonna give up without a fight and have filed an appeal.
"I'll be honest with you as a bully," said Ackert.
And I think people should fight any form of harassment, especially this.
Ackert said that the Homeowners' Union claimed that its mailbox is not in line with Southwood's aesthetic values.
United States Marine veteran John Ackert said he was ordered to remove the American flag from his mailbox.
"As a result of the approach to the end of the holiday season, we ask you to remove the envelope representing the American flag from the mailbox," sent a letter.
The decorations may be out 30 days before and shall be removed no later than 15 days after.
He said the envelope's been out for four years.
It got there 30 days after it moved into the house.
Messages to the Southwood Housing Community Association did not receive an immediate answer on Thursday morning.
Some Ackert's neighbor told WCTV that the letter was a bit harsh, and they were not particularly surprised by the activities of the Houseowners' Union.
"They do these things all the time," said Mike Stephenson.
I think it's ridiculous.
Why shouldn't you be patriotic in your country?
Mike Patel said, "This is a veteran who served our country.
It's just a mailbox with a flag.
I don't think that's right.
The house belongs to him, at least that's something you can afford.
The letter from the Houseowners' Union states that Ackert has 15 days to remove the envelope, otherwise he will be fined.
He has not received an appeal.
Vietnam's "remorse" for the German kidnapping charge
On Thursday, Vietnam said that she felt regret about the comments of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which accused the Vietnamese intelligence service of kidnapping the former Vietnamese oil company, which is wanted in the country because of the acquisition charges.
The German authorities believe that Trinh Xuan Thanh was taken with him from Berlin, which left Vietnam for intelligence officers 48 hours on Wednesday to leave the country.
Thanh faces the accusations of possession, with the death penalty in case of conviction.
He was looking for an azyl in Germany, but his statement had not yet been worked out when Vietnamese authorities demanded his release.
Le Thi Hang, a representative of the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told the reporters that these comments were "extremely regrettable" and Thanh turned himself in to the police in Vietnam on 31 July.
"Vietnam considers it always important and wants to develop strategic relations with Germany," he said without going into the details.
Thanh, 51, disappeared in July of last year after being initially charged with unfair management in the subsidiary of the state oil and gas gigant PetroVietnam, which resulted in losses of around USD 150 million.
Vietnamese police issued an arrest warrant in September.
In March, the police opened an investigation into the acquisition of his alleged involvement in the property development project.
Thanh was Chairman of PetroVietnam Construction Joint Stock Corporation until 2013, when he was appointed to several senior positions in the government, including the Deputy Chairman of Hau Giang Province in the southern Mekong Delta.
He was elected to the National Assembly in May 2016, but was released from the communist legislative body before its first meeting.
He was also expelled from Communist parties.
The Vietnamese Ambassador in Germany was invited to the Foreign Ministry on Tuesday and informed that Germany is calling for Thanh to be returned so that the procedures for the release and release of Thanh could be carried out correctly.
The bus driver saved eight puppies from the roadside, not knowing that dogs actually have the owner.
"Where I put these eight puppies, a woman would have thrown me out of the apartment with the dogs," said Oleg, the bus driver, who saved the dog-stamping puppies on the road without surveillance, giving them to the asylum worker.
Soon, however, the owner of the dogs in the shelter appeared, for whom it became unclear why the puppies were taken away from his home.
The bus driver of Harjumaa, Oleg, said that he has already worked as a bus driver since the early 1990s, but this has not been the case before in his career."I drove the bus No 146 on my usual route.
Near the Harju-Rist, I noticed there's a little bit of something running around by the road.
I thought it was a cocoon, but it turns out it was four puppies," the bus driver reminded me.
At the moment, his heart went crazy, and he stopped a bus full of passengers to pick up the puppies.
"The damage began, the cars would have driven over them, and the dogs would have been thrown away," Oleg said.
He added that the passengers were reasonable, and they too were delighted by soft dogs.
The puppies were a little scared at first, but then they got fun.
The puppies on board, the bus driver went into a new circle because the schedule needed to be followed.
Once again, when passing by the find of the puppies, he saw four more little dogs there.
It was a German sheep dog.
They were so instantaneous, and they were immediately seen to have been taken care of.
The dogs were beautiful. They were amazing.
The first idea was, of course, that someone wanted to get rid of them for some reason," the bus driver said that for this reason he decided to carry the puppies.
"I also picked up these four puppies and called the police," Oleg recalled.
The harvesters contacted the shelter of Tallinn animals, whose workers came after the Baltic station.
But didn't the bus driver be tempted to take the furballs?
That's the idea.
A dog boy was so beautiful and calm.
He sat nice like an adult dog," said Oleg.
But where do I put these eight puppies?
A woman would have thrown me out of the apartment with the dogs.
We still have a little kid.
Early for a dog," he added.
Eve Tobias, the head of the Tallinn Animal Asylum Service, confirmed that 8 German sheep dogs, two-and-a-half months old, were brought into the asylum.
But the same day, the owner came for the puppy family.
"We didn't even formalize these puppies and give them back," he said.
"The dog owner wasn't very upset, but he said that they had the only house in sight and the bus driver could have asked if the puppies belonged to them," Tobias said.
However, the head of the shelter added that it is good that the driver picked up the youngsters on the road and therefore did not have an accident.
In fact, it was very good for the bus driver to react!
Jordan's Court of Justice enforced the life sentence for killing three U.S. soldiers
Jordan’s military court of appeal imposed a life sentence on Jordan’s soldier last year for the shooting of three United States military trainers.
Last month at the war trial, Senior Sergeant Marik al-Tuwayhale assigned a life sentence for the killing of Americans at the entrance to the South Jordan Air Base, along with hard work.
Al-Tuwayha opened fire on the American caravan, claiming he was afraid of the base attack.
After the decision, the video from the security camera showed, however, that he continued shooting even when two Americans were shadowing and waving with their hands to stop shooting.
On Thursday, the newsroom Hala Akhbar, associated with the Jordanian army, announced that the five judges' military court of appeal confirmed al-Tuwayha's punishment.
James Harrison spends about $300 000 a year to keep his body in play.
Each player of the NFL depends on their body to earn a living.
Therefore, many other athletes also invest a lot of money in body care and rehabilitation to stay in peak form.
Jeremy Fowler, on the ESPN.com portal, looked at how far some veterans are ready to go to extend their careers.
But no case is as extreme as the 39-year-old James Harrison, the player in the 14th season of Pittsburgh Steelers' rear line.
According to Fowler, Harrison spends an annual average of $300 000 on needle care, massage therapy, chiropractors, and dome laying.
Most of the costs relate to travel across the country to meet specialists.
"I don't have to keep an account of such things," Harrison said.
"If you compare the amounts I earn with my expenses, "the payments are worth it, given how I feel."
Mike Mitchell, Harrison's training partner and a teammate at Steelers, valued his body care for the annual amount of $200,000.
A 30-year-old Mitchell has tested the body relaxing (in English "body temperature") described by Fowler as "55 kilos of metal as a massage roll".
"And instead of rolling on it, they roll it over you," Mitchell said.
"If you have a tight spot on your leg and they start moving around this thing, it hurts sometimes.
But when you get up, the tension will be gone.
It just beats the voltage out."
They're ready to make extra effort, but former NFL players, Barry Cofield and Ryan Harris, spend an average of $50,000 a year on recovery.
Cofield, who played 10 seasons in the New York Giants and Washington Redskins lines, has expressed regret that he did not spend more.
"If I could go back, I'd invest even more," said Cofield Fowler.
"I'd probably say at least twice as much.
I spent the first eight years of my career in very good health.
Perhaps more procedures could have been helpful to the end."
Ryan Shazier, a 24-year-old defense line player, expressed his willingness to step in the footsteps of his veterans' teammates.
"If you pay $100,000 and earn another three million playing, this decision is quite simple," Shazier said.
As far as the long-term career is concerned, investing in the recovery of players is much smarter than spending money on cars and villas.
An average NFL player is lucky if he can play for longer than 30 years, the more Harrison's success should convince his colleagues to re-direct their expenses.
But maybe they can just find some local specialists.
The Weekly Festival Baltic boss Gunnar Viese tells the evening paper that the festival started years ago in Finland and its owners went to see the beach strip under Riga's side, but a stop was made on the way back to Pärnu, and so the festival had been sold to Estonia.
Gunnar says they have a target of 25,000 visitors a day, but chicks are only considered when the festival is over.
Preparation for this party started last September.
"We had information from the city that construction would begin in the last place, there will be a hotel," Gunnar says, which changes would have to face this year.
Now you can't see any knocks there, but you have to assume that if the knock didn't go down this year, it's next.
So maybe we should have moved out of there sometime," he explains why the festival has moved this year.
They're having a festival all year.
People work for the Weekly between a thousand and a half thousand people - policemen, management teams, volunteers, traders, security teams, etc.
According to Visse, it was the hardest thing to do for the Weekly to have a duet for The Chainsmokers.
After all, men are the undisputed first-number of pop-music worlds.
Why The Chainsmokers was hard to get to the Weekly and how Gunnar comments that two artists canceled their performances, see already in the video.
In reply to Ansip, the bike: we have done a lot for Estonia's success.
Andrus Ansip, Vice-President of the European Commission, said that he was sad to look at Estonia's day-to-day policies because the Jüri Ratas government has turned on the head of a simple and predictable tax system.
You took the opportunity of asking me what I have done for Estonia’s success and which I can be proud of.
I am pleased that we have been a good team in the government and have made many important decisions over the past few months, many of which have been expected in Estonia for more than ten years," said Ratas in social media today.
According to Ratas, these decisions are for example the tax reform to raise people's incomes, the pension reform to ensure a decent retirement age for the elderly, the municipal reform to balance Estonia's development, the increase in agricultural subsidies to revive and, of course, health reform to provide accessible and high-quality medical care.
"I wish you a good vacation!" wrote the bike in its turn to Ansip.
Talents on Pärnu Weekly: drunk man climbed into a foreign car to sleep
Last night at 3:00 p.m., the police got a little on their own.
One Audi’s owner stated that in a tank near Port Artur, a strange man has climbed into his car and fell asleep.
A patrol who reacted to the event found a man who, on the arrival of the guards, was agitated.
For a moment, a man was tired on his journey and found a place in the back of a foreign man’s car.
"The man took his own way back on his way home after the wake-up of the defenders," says the prefecture of the West on Facebook.
It's the end of it, it's the end of it!

Pula Film Festival at the Roman Amphitheater, Croatia
Gladiators, blood, screaming crowd, muddy arena - such a picture opened 2,000 years ago in Pula amphitheater in Croatia, where now the summer night of July enjoys movies from the international audience.
For the first time, the outdoor screen was set up in the Roman-era building in 1953, making Pula one of the oldest outdoor cinemas in Europe.
Under the festivities, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, John Malkovich and Ben Kingsley have enjoyed good films.
The price is symbolic: the evening with high-quality films in the Mediterranean is about €3.
Sala Montjuïc Open Air Cinema, Spain
Next to the film Sala Montjuïc offers a wonderful view of the open air cinema.

Under the stars of cinema, Italy
The true spirit of the nostalgic Italian can be experienced in the central field of Bologna, where the restored pearls of the local film archives are shown at summer evenings.
Next to the tenth church of the world, San Petronio basilika, the old films can be seen by 3000 or 5000 people.
The buildings of the North of the 15th century, with the heat and good society of the summer evening, create a romantic atmosphere in which every rough Nordic will melt.

The stupidest questions to ask the bartender.
Huffington Post conveys the barmen's ears with questions that they prefer not to hear.
What kind of drink do you do best?
Some drinks indeed have more ingredients than others, but they need the same skills and coldness to produce them.
Bar servants often interpret this question as "What is the easiest/fastest to make right now?", which tells them that the customer has anything to drink, whether it is hard to do with a bartender or not.
What kind of drink do you like most?
This question is interpreted in the same way as what cocktail is the easiest way to get from the bar.
It's not the barkeeper's thing to say, it's the client who makes the decisions according to the thickness of his wallet.
Rather, the bartenders would like to ask if there are any special offers at the moment.
What's the deal?
Perhaps it is a purely heartfelt desire to find out if the bar is distinguished by any offers from others, but that can also be asked differently.
Nor can the bartender know what a client would prefer.
Can I have a drink that won't be very sweet?
It is similar to the previous rule that the barman is not familiar with your taste and preferences, and what is sweet for one may not be sweet for the other.
Yet, he is willing to listen to the flavors that the recommended cocktail might have.
Does this drink give me a headache?
A barman is neither a medic nor a fortune teller so he can afford it to the client, give it to the heart.
Cold summers have driven Estonians abroad to travel so that package travels are not only expensive but are sold out regardless of the price.
Also, cheap air tickets and last-minute tickets should not be expected; it would be wiser to think about next year's travel plans.
The man hostageed the model with a plan to sell it in the dark web.
In Italy, a Polish citizen took hostage the British model.
The man was planning to auction a 20-year-old woman in the dark web, or encrypted online, and Guardian announced.
According to the police, by 11 July she was lured to Milan with a promise that she would be able to work on a photo session.
Instead, he was drugged and taken to a villa near Turin.
The prisoners allegedly tried to sell a woman on the dark Web for £230,000 and made a ransom claim to her model agency.
However, on 17 July he was taken to the British Consulate.
According to the police, Polish citizen Lukasz Herba, who lives in Britain, is a suspect.
According to Corriere della Sera, a man discovered that a kidnapped woman had a small child and did not want to be a sex slave.
Such experiments bind people.
It would be good if we could continue to think and draw conclusions.
The recommendation to spend a little more time as a friend in the background study is obvious.
More generally, however, everyone could have a strategy that he shares in social media.
At national level, however, it must be asked whether officials and politicians are sufficiently aware of the dangers posed by social media.
The life of the werewolves created under controlled conditions ended with a summer school, but certainly not of the real devils.
From time to time, you always have to go to the woods, for whatever reason.
But if the coolness of the skin hangs, it's time to make a hot tea drink.
There are sufficient resources in the forest to do this.
Protect Home! Makes a little overview.
The reason we are talking about tea is that coffee and real tea contain caffeine, which, to some extent, has a refreshing effect, but is not the best for our health.
The plants in the free nature must always be ready for testing, because both recipes and flavors are different.
Some plants do not need to be cooked for long, but only hot water is enough, while others need to be drawn for hours.
Of course, it must also be noted that water and plants are clean enough.
It also depends much on the season and place of collection.
Let us now take a closer look at how to make a few simple drinks and how they can affect us.
Pistachios
The pine casserole can drink calmly around the year.
If it is good to drink 2 litres of water per day, this tea is good enough to satisfy the need for vitamin C and extra energy.
As for all plants, it is possible to obtain useful elements from pine trees using alternative methods, for example, by breaking the thorns - it is not necessary to cook them for long, to stay up with hot water and to drag them for a few hours.
Half a litre of water takes 0.4 liters to be boiled for 15 minutes.
The result is a drink containing approximately 25 mg vitamin C, a lot of potassium and zinc.
In addition, the drink contains about 1.5 sugar cubes, i.e. approximately 20 kcal sugars.
Pineapples can always be added lemon and honey to improve taste.
And when the drink gets strong, it can be diluted with water like syrup.
It's the same, but the drink tastes a little different.
The raspberry drink is great and helps with a lot of problems, from rheumatism to squid.
Raspberry helps to overcome fatigue, is painfully affected and helps to relieve cough and lower fever in cold conditions.
Consequently, it would not be worth more than half a litre a day.
The raspberry drink also makes you sweat, which is why a more peaceful moment should be found to enjoy it in the winter.
For the production of a drink in winter, take fresh raspberry stalks, use leaves, spices or berries during summertime.
For a half - gallon drink, you need a little bit of the right - length branches, which you have to boil until the water acquires a red tones.
You can also make an image of the Raspberry.
For that, crush the rods and keep them in warm water for a few hours.
A longer and more thorough treatment also makes the drink stronger.
The finished raspberry drink can also be added to pine pomegranate.
Blackberries
Blackberry is a tree that looks like a piece of black-burned wood in nature.
Most of the time, it's on the sauces, but it's on the other side.
Mushroom is a very wide area of use – as a hot drink, as a fire, instead of a violin, etc.
You can wash yourself very well with ash.
Blackberries are a kind of super drink that can be used to treat very many diseases, even cancer, to increase tone, to reduce stress, to prolong life expectancy.
The fungus contains a number of unique compounds and many vitamins B, as well as antioxidants and some minerals and proteins.
Tea made from mushrooms can drink daily, there is no risk of over-consumption.
To make a drink, about 3 x 3 cm of mushrooms are sufficient to be cooked in 2-3 litres of water for 5-15 minutes.
Prime Minister Jüri Ratas visited Estonia's fourth largest island in the framework of a tour of the small islands, where he met local leaders and residents to discuss the topical issues of island life.
The tour of the island of Vormsi started in the port of Sviby, where Prime Minister Rata was welcomed by the municipality of Vorms Tanel Viks and the chairman of the municipal council Ivo Sarapuu.
The first was the historic church of St. Olavi and the adjacent cemetery, which is unique in Estonia in terms of its birch and sandstone ring Christians.
There followed an interview with Vormsi Children's School, where Director Age Hälvin discussed the state of life of the school with the Prime Minister and the organisation of study, according to which the students of the school are involved in distal education.
In the afternoon, the Prime Minister returned to the new and modern operational service building, which was opened in 2015, in addition to meeting the people of the island.
The debate addressed important issues for the population, such as the development of shipping and air routes between the small islands and the mainland.
The country has committed itself to ensuring regular transport connections in the small islands of permanent status, but for example during the summer period, the growing traffic will also make it more difficult for the local population to travel significantly.
These are places where the state can take local wishes and needs into account early on in the planning process," said the Prime Minister.
In addition, there were discussions on the construction, interest education, island safety and rescue capacity of the port of small vessels.
Today's visit to Vorms was the last part of a tour of the Prime Minister's small islands to explore the environment in the islands and to discuss issues that need to be resolved with local residents and local government leaders.
In July, the leader of the government passed the Saaremaa, Kihnu, Ruhnu, Abruka and Vilsandi islands and Manilaidu, and during August, he has visited Naissaart, Pranglit and Aikana.
For the first time, the Central Party will go to the elections without the founding and ideological cornerstone of the party.
So far, we've said the Central Party and we've been thinking about Savisaar or the other way around.
Now the Central Party has to find a way without him.
They must also open up the party's colorful, sometimes criminal and embarrassing past, the intra-party supporters of Savisaari and the electorate's expectations.
The departure of the Savisaari puts the Central Party in the most difficult situation in the ideological plan.
Based on current political practice and ideology, it is said that an old rhino plays them firmly over.
Several cards that used to seem like drums may not be realised this time.
The populism map for the Central Party is not working because Savisaar can always afford more than the Prime Party.
Playing on the Russian map has been difficult both because of the position of the Central Party in the government and because we can see here too how the so-called Savinova electoral union presses the bottom of the gas.
As a result of the ongoing trial, the card of the sufferer is already in the pocket of Savisaari.
A map of the People's Front and the poor are also missing for the Central Party.
The first of these is that it is less valuable than it is, and the coalition partners that prevent the second from playing more powerfully in government.
But one card may have even greater weight.
All the last elections have confirmed that successful parties are able to formulate the main electoral conflict and then implement it.
The main conflict has always been around Savisaari.
If a party has to come up with the idea of a well-functioning contrast to life, there is another drum in the Central Party's deck.
So what happens to the Central Party?
They have a strong party parade and a considerable resource.
Record cuts are also required in advance of the elections.
Four years ago, the shameless self-advertise made by taxpayers' money has hopefully been repaid to the winterers.
Tallinn City Media is still available, but the cultivation of private grief and journalism has also been reduced there.
In addition, the party has voice magnets.
Their role will be to remove the chestnuts from the fire this time, because the image of the power party is not enough to motivate the voters in a significant way.
In an ideological plan, Jüri Ratas has to find its way, because the journey with the clay storm ended this week.
Three U.S. Marines disappeared in Australia’s waters in a plane crash.
The U.S. Navy and the Marine Army have completed their search operation, reports the Marine Base Camp Butler in a statement in Japan, in principle confirming that the Army is no longer expected to find the missing persons alive.
The accident happened on a marine aircraft called Osprey MV-22 that took off USS Bonhome from Richard's ship.
There were 26 people on board of the plane, 23 of whom managed to find and save.
The plane that crashed into the sea took part in joint exercises between the United States and Australia last month in Shoalwater Bay, Queensland.
Australian Minister of Defence Marise Payne said that the incident took place on Saturday near Shoalwater Bay.
She found a strange wedding ring in the washing machine, who could own it?
"I started taking the washing out of the machine when the light between the rubber seal of the washing machine was on my eye," she says, "how she found a strange wedding ring in her washing machine.
In fact, at the door of the washing machine, Karin paid no attention to the brightness.
I got the machine started again.
"At the side of two small children, this dirty laundry is immediately formed," the woman bludgeons.
When I got through the second wash and started taking out the laundry, the light between the rubber seal of the washing machine got to my eye and then I found that ring.
The name of the man married 14 years ago - Tomi - has been engraved from the gold ring.
Since someone in a family with a name or a woman who could be married to a Tom doesn't know, the ring is a complete mystery.
Karin studied from the parent’s child that he might have found a ring in his yard, put it in his pocket, and through it the ring was in the washing machine, but the child confirmed that he had not brought the ring home.
Karin and his partner have lived in the Apartment of Madala Street in Tallinn for a year.
They used to rent it out, and from then on it was also a washing machine.
But if the ring had anything to do with the tenants, how did it get in the machine?
"Now I'm desperate, and I can't understand the way the ring would have landed in the washing machine," she laughs.
Since the pace of life next to two young children is quite rapid, the finding initially forgot to go home to the closet.
"At the last time, there have been posts in search of the owner of the ring of marriage, and now it seemed that it was time to find the owner of the ring he found", Karin refers to a case in which the ring of marriage found on Puhang Street in Tallinn last week happily found the owner.
"When they find and search different things on Facebook, I thought first of all I'd try luck there," says Karin, whose mail has already been shared by nearly 4,000 people.
"Postitus has received all kinds of feedback and not all is good", she threatens to point out that the first comments suggested her husband to be listed.
That was when I felt like I needed this shit.
That my husband has become the biggest cheater ever heard of.
To be honest, it made me worried at first, but later, when you came to me and said that maybe I'd been banging the ring with the owner, it made me laugh.
Comments also suggested that maybe the ring reached women in the second round of clothes in their pocket.
"Well, at some point six months ago, some other round of pants bought to go to work that flew into a washing machine without a more thorough examination, but really?" she's discussing herself.
All right, but my partner and I agreed that we should find the owner of the ring now because of the principle.
Whatever the reason for the loss of that ring.
Divorce, family or whatever.
I think it's only the right thing to do, because if I ever lost my wedding ring, I know I'd be grateful to someone who would try to find me and restore valuable property.
Karin has also called on the family status office to get help from there in finding the owner.
However, I received the answer that on such a date in Estonia and under such a name, the gentleman has not married.
One ring has been found by the owner
Recently, the wedding ring found in Pelguranta, Tallinn, on July 21, arrived happily in the hand of the owner, whose gravity promised to assume that it belonged to an elderly woman.
"I walked with dogs in the morning, and I noticed Puuang behind 53 houses, in the set-up of a golden ring," Gerli said that the gravity promised to assume it belonged to an elderly woman.
Gerli posted a photo of the ring (on photo) on her Facebook page and shared information with the Northern Town and Northern Prefecture in the group "Noteed in Tallinn".
In two weeks' time, the police contacted Gerl and announced that the ringmaker had been identified.
"I got the owner's daughter's contact, and on Monday night she went into the possession of her daughter's possession." The ring was gone, because the old lady had hurt her hand and put the ring in the other finger, where it slipped.
"He lost it the morning I walked with my dog," says Gerli.
Although media attention has mainly been paid to Pärnu and the Weekly held there, this is not the only weekend music festival.
The Insikurmu festival in Põlvamaa also has loyal fans.
One of them says on Twitter, "I sold the Weekly ticket so I could go to Insikurmu".
And why not?
In addition to domestic artists, performers from America, Finland, Lithuania, Hungary, England, and elsewhere will attend there.
The festival in the magical forest surprises artists from the charming location.
One of them, Lucy Rose, did not get to wonder on Twitter this morning how beautiful Estonia is.
But also, visitors have not had goats when sharing great things.
To be a part of Intsikurmu’s festival magic, see also the gallery!
The Estonian U18 team recognized Britain’s better quality in the semifinal, and the A division cannot be reached
The match began very quickly and during the first quarter, which the British won with five points (18:23) many baskets were thrown.
During the second quarter, the gap continued to increase and to rest in the nine-point success of the guests (31:40).
Estonia was able to win the third quarter, but only one point.
The state of the Estonians' loss before the last ten minutes was eight points (46:54).
In the fourth quarter, the game broke down completely, and ultimately the loss of 61:75 had to be accepted.
The loss destroyed the Estonians' hopes of reaching Division A, because only two of the best teams will be able to get there.
In the third place tomorrow, Estonia will meet the winner of the game between Croatia - Israel.
Police are searching for an Estonian criminal by post card
Europol is hunting the stabilizer of the Tallinn nightclub.
Russian citizen Ernest Gammer, who stabbed a foreign man at the Tallinn nightclub in 2010 and caused him serious health damage, has become the most wanted-in list in Europe.
Australian leagues stand on the crossroads
Professional sport stands on a crossroads in Australia: some areas have traveled on a corporate road to such an extent that it is too business-centred to classify sport;
others return to the amateur world, which is too sport-centred to view it as a business.
This confusion is demonstrated by the painful delays of Cricket Australia (CA) in reaching a pay agreement with players, the indecision of the Australian Ragbit Union (ARU), the rise of stakeholders from the Australian Football Federation (FFA), the difficulty of raging at the meeting of an independent committee and the indelible efforts of the Australian Football League (AFL) to be the flag of social justice among the people.
The Investment Banker and Chairman of the Australian Sport Commission John Wyllie have tried to actively lead the Olympic sport on the same road as the professional leagues, placing businessmen in leading positions who have no basic experience in the field of sport.
The mining gigant Rio Tinto, who has a reputation for the tacit use of tactics, was seen in a collina CA problem in reaching an agreement with the Association of Australian Cricket Players (ACA).
The CA chairman, David Peever, is a former CEO of Rio Tinto Australia and he has hired a head of Rio Tinto and an advisor to the CA for wage negotiations.
It would be mistaken, however, to think that elite men whose approach is ruthless in dealing with cricket players do not love this sport.
Peever was, for example, a regular visitor to Storm’s home games until he moved to another state.
Nevertheless, tough negotiations between CA and ACA and extremely high wages have left the impression that Australia's summer favourite reference now belongs to more business than to sport.
On the contrary, the incompetent leader of the ARU, the NAB’s former Managing Director, Cameron Clyde, has been unable to pick out the Australian Super Rugby team too hard to push back to its roots.
The people of the Ragbit Union now prefer to hover to the suburbs of the stadium to watch the game between amateur teams, while at the same time drinking beer and smoking hot dog.
The Ragbilitus welcomes the fact that they have the most corporately qualified and versatile management in Australia, but too many failures in meeting the requirements of international partners show that it is still too much sport to be a business.
Both digital and football have management problems, as stakeholders demand more power.
The presidents of both leagues, John Grant of ARLC and Steven Lowy of FFA, have shown that their business skills have not been enough to achieve corporate stability.
Grant, former Kangaroo, ran a successful IT company, but was 20 years away from the game.
It became a value when the newly formed ARLC needed an independent chairman.
Too many stakeholders who did not trust each other decided that no one who has participated in the Commission's work in any way during the last three years, except as a passive fan.
Pendel, however, moved too far to the commercial side, and too many fans have been looking for a savior ever since - someone with a past in sports.
Lowy, Executive Director of Foreign Investments in Westfield, was the chairman of the FFA from his father, Frank, one of the richest people in Australia.
The A-league clubs want to be better represented in the congress of the Board of Directors.
Their owners lose money, but they believe they're as worthy as Manchester United.
Ironically, the Sports and Business Ethics Office sends FIFA ambassadors out to end the Sport Civil War.
AFL has its own links with Rio Tinto through the financial manager of the recently retired Chairman, Mike Fitzpatrick and former AFL Commissioner Chris Lynch, the mining gigand.
The role of the national leader in promoting gender equality, the activities of natives and refugees and the rights of gay people is too high.
Some cynics might suggest that this is done in the face of government aid.
The AFL president, Richard Goyder, said to Fitzpatrick, "AFL is more than business, given how it helps all these communities."
Goyder will be Wesfarmers' soon-departure CEO and the first chairman of AFL who has not played at the primary level of the game.
Former Wesfarmers Chairman Bob Everybody is working for Cricket Australia's board.
The line leading to the appointment of members of the Board of Professional Sports is often the importance of independence in front of competence.
In the heat of recruiting business people, they have forgotten something that could be called affection and passion for sport.
Moreover, many corporate heavyweights are not accustomed to critical monitoring activities of the media and sometimes also of a personal level.
Something that works in a corporate world may not be transferred to the sport.
Flynn submitted a report on the disclosure of the corrected information showing additional payments
Michael Flynn, who served for a short time as a National Security Adviser to President Trump, presented a revised report on the disclosure of federal financial information on Thursday containing new details of Flynn's agreements concerning Trump's transition to the Presidential Office, the Iranian-American business-man-related company and the company's mother company working for the Trump campaign.
In a letter which sent out correct information, Flynn noted that its initial disclosure reports were presented under urgent circumstances without the usual consultation and review by the White House lawyers and the Government's Ethics Office.
According to the letter, Flynn was not part of the attention given to others since he was no longer a White House employee at the time.
Flynn gave up his post just 24 days after he took office in the middle of the rumors that he had given Vice-President Pence misleading information about his post-election ties with the Russian Ambassador in the United States.
Flynn was also granted criticism for cross-border payments made to him during his work in the private sector following the resignation of the Director of the Defence Intelligence Agency in 2014.
In the information previously published to the investigators of the House of Representatives, Flynn declared that in 2015 the related entities received around 68 000 dollars in fees and payments.
In addition to Russia's income, the information provided on Thursday revealed that Flynn received at least $5,000 for the consultancy service for the construction project of the nuclear power plants in the Middle East.
Flynn's work on the project was published earlier, but it was not known that it was paid for.
The updated information also confirms that Flynn had agreed to cooperate with the SCL Group - at the time Cambridge Analytics British parent company - that is, with the company hired by Donald Trump as part of the campaign.
Cambridge is one of the main donors of the hedge fund magnate Robert L. Mercer, whose daughter Rebekah is an influential financial supporter of the conservatives.
Washington Post announced in February that Flynn was hired as an adviser to the SCL Group.
According to the people who knew his role, Flynn’s aim was to help SCL’s American subsidiary to win new public contracts with the United States.
SCL also hired a former Flynn colleague to lead the efforts to conclude public contracts with the Head of State Intelligence.
Flynn did not receive any compensation or actual work from SCL, according to the person who was aware of his activity.
With the new information, Flynn received some 28 000 dollars in connection with Trump's transition to the Presidential Office.
The largest source of revenue disclosed is $140 000 for Flynn's work as a consultant and consultant at NJK Holding Corp, Minneapolis. This company is run by Nasser Kazeminy, a businessman born in Iran and currently living in the United States.
On Thursday evening, the Associated Press announced the statement by the NJK "to advise Flynn NJK Holdings on the interest of investing in the company's securities".
NJK finances the technology company GreenZone Systems, which is vice-chaired by Flynn.
GreenZone i is run by Jim Kian, Flynn's business partner Flynn Intellis, a company currently under investigation for its role in lobbying on behalf of a company in the Netherlands, which is related to the Turkish Government.
Earlier on Thursday, Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), a leading democracy in the Committee on the Monitoring and Government Reform of the House of Representatives, asked Kian to provide information on the foreign business contacts and travels of Flynn.
As part of Flynn's earlier security check, Kian told military investigators that his partner had several foreign business contacts.
According to Cummings, Flynn told the same investigators nothing about such contacts.
However, according to a person who is familiar with the situation, Flynn nevertheless passed security controls at that time.
The main performer was alive on the stage in August Babylon, and the singer was taken to Tallinn with an ambulance.
Ivan was able to play the set to the end when he was hit by a medical condition.
An ambulance was called in, massaging his heart for several decades," says Indrek Ditmann to Life24.
"There was a delay in the plan, but the festival goes on," he says, "The public has been informed, of course they saw everything that happened on the stage."
Currently Ivan is on his way to Tallinn with an ambulance and it is not known whether he will survive or not.
Of course we hope for the best," says Ditmann to finish.
The witness told Western life that there was a medical incident during Denisenko's performance.
First the man stopped singing, then the piano game began to pass, and the man fell on the stage.
The stage was attended by Jan Uusföld, who asked if there was a doctor among the audience.
A little later, he asked me to pray for Denise.
Ivan Denisenko / August
Ivan Denisenko, or Ivan Blues, is a well-known Ukrainian artist and cultural figure.
Ivani musicians began in parallel with art studies at the Ukrainian National Academy of Arts and Architecture.
At the university, he was immediately fascinated by his incredibly deep bass and was invited to sing nationwide folk choir Golden Gate.
He became friends with the people who introduced him to the blues and later became his bandmates.
The first concert of the Ivan Blues & Friends band took place on 31 December 2007 at a bar in Kiev called Rag-Time.
From there the band has been operating regularly, performing in clubs, concert halls and schools across Ukraine.
English author publishes the book in the back of the book
The Helping Hand is the first book of Michaels, the former editor of BBC and the mother of two children. He has previously written to Singapore Tatler.
It took three years to finish the book, and it is dedicated to his Philippines assistants Maricon Espiritu and Ginalyn Naragi, who help keep the son, Joseph, four-year-old, and daughter, eight-year-old Florence.
The assistants he describes as "family members" helped to test recipes while writing the book. This is the first such book in Singapore, which is published in both English and in the back of the log.
"The Helping Hand" is available in bookshops everywhere in Singapore at 39.90 SGD and also in centres of migrants abroad, including Hong Kong, Dubai, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines.
He thought he had an abdominal virus from his colleague.
But why were his symptoms so different?
At the trauma point, he was given a high dose of acetaminophen to reduce fever.
For the rest of the day, he was kept being questioned, stabbed, crushed, and investigated.
No test showed anything, but they didn't want to send him home.
He understood the reason.
For the last two years, he had taken a medicine called etanercept to treat Sjögren syndrome.
It reduced the ability of the immune system to fight infections.
Sjögren is an autoimmune disorder - a rather mysterious disease in which the body’s own white blood cells attack normal tissue, as if it was an invasive organism that sow chaos in both the glands that produce tears and saliva as well as in some joints.
The weekly injections of etanercept had been helpful by reducing his joint pain.
However, he knew that this medicine caused him to be quite helpless in case of severe infection.
When acetaminophen started to work, the patient felt much better.
The doctors at the emergency room decided to leave him at the hospital at night.
If it's a virus, as the doctors suspected, she'll be fine the next day and she'll be released home.
When Girard first heard of his new patient, he took a course of infections to which people who were given etanercept are susceptible.
That list was long.
The virus cannot be treated before the diagnosis, therefore it focused on bacterial infections.
One of the bacteria that attacks people with immune deficiency is a food-transmitted liseria bacteria.
It is often found in unpasteurised milk and cheeses, causing terrible nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, which he did not have.
Legion business disease is another infection that is common amongst those taking this medicine, but it did not have cough or shortness of breath.
Even more common bacteria in Staphylococcus aureus can cause joint infections, but, again, he had no joint complaints.
Nevertheless, the doctor planned to start extensive antibiotic therapy to cover all these risks.
However, when faced with the patient, it did not seem that he could suffer from severe infection.
The doctors at the trauma center had not given him antibiotics.
The doctor had the opportunity to delay the administration of antibiotics and simply monitor and wait, but if the patient had one of the infections he had read about, the treatment could have been delayed by a few hours.
The situation made it even more difficult for the patient to think he was allergic to penicillin, although he did not remember what happened when he took it.
It created a risk-benefit-to-risk shift.
The decision to start antibiotic treatment normally with low contributions will change if its effects are so dangerous.
He asked a colleague, another resident, to evaluate the patient.
Girard didn't tell his colleague that he was planning an antibiotic treatment, he just asked the patient to review it and give his recommendation.
The colleague met with the patient and agreed.
Although he looked good, he would be virtually vulnerable to infection.
The doctor should give the patient antibiotics.
Since the patient has had penicillin allergy, Girard should have him tested to check that he or she tolerates a medicine that is not a penicillin but a close relative to him or her.
Girard asked me to give you a test dose.
If she had had a serious reaction, she would have had a rash or a fall in her blood pressure.
Neither of them happened.
Therefore, he was given a full dose.
A few hours later, Girard got a call.
The patient's body temperature had risen to 39 degrees.
She rushed to see the patient.
The patient's face shined out of a thin layer of sweat and her cheeks were pink.
Although he seemed uncomfortable, his heart and blood pressure were fine.
The doctor thanked himself for giving the patient antibiotics.
He asked for another dose of Tylenol, and when his patient came over for the last time, he slept deeply.
The fever had stopped.
The sweaty coum and pink cheeks were gone.
The next night, when Girard returned to the hospital for a night shift, he first visited this patient.
He had also received five other patients, but because of this patient Girard was most concerned at home after handing over to his daily team.
During those hours when he didn't see her, the lab had grown into her blood organism.
It was too early to say exactly what it was.
It was clear, however, that this is a bacteria that is powerful enough to allow Petri to grow rapidly, and that it is not Staphylococcus aureus or legionary disease.
The list of other options was long and none of them actually saw what was right.
It took them two more days to finally identify the bacteria.
It was a liseria bacteria.
Girard, like everyone else who cared for the patient, was surprised.
As a doctor, you'll get pictures of the diseases in your head.
For Girard, listeriosis was a disease derived from non-pasteurised milk and soft cheeses causing nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
He worked further on the material for this unusual infection and found that although people with a normal immune system may experience these symptoms, they usually recover as a patient’s colleague.
However, in pregnant women, older than 65 years of age and people with a impaired immune system, the infection may become dominant outside the gastrointestinal tract - sometimes without showing any symptoms - and enter the bloodstream.
It could spread over the whole body like a fire.
This type of infection, called invasive listeriosis, can occur in up to 30% of patients with this infection.
Indeed, although it is not as widespread as botulism, listeriosis can be equally lethal.
Early antibiotic therapy can save your life.
When it comes to a food - transmitted disease, what food carried this bacteria?
Although the patient and his colleague had not consumed non-pasteurised milk or soft cheese on the trip, the Internet search this summer in Scotland identified a list of cases related to smoked beef.
Neither of them had eaten smoked beef, but they ate some smoked salmon.
Where they picked up the bacteria exactly remained a secret.
Once the doctor’s team found out what was wrong, they were able to adjust the antibiotics.
His three-week treatment ended in July.
The doctors suggested that he take his time until the end of the summer, but by now he feels quite well and has returned to the museum and his beloved work.
He was praised for preventing a global cyber attack.
And then he was arrested.
When the malware from Krono was first advertised in Russian underground for the first time in 2014, the price charged for it indicated that the sale of the malware was a profitable undertaking.
Kronos was advertised as hacking tools capable of obtaining data, including usernames and passwords, ATM PIN codes and personal information useful for breaking security issues.
Motherboard announced on Thursday that Hutchins was held at Las Vegas airport after a weekly visit to the security conferences Black Hat and Defcon.
He was planning to fly back to his home in Britain.
The security community reacted to the arrest of its valued star with wonder and scepticism.
Some warned that claims against Hutchins could undermine the relationship between "white" hackers - researchers who are looking for the weak spots of software to identify and solve problems, not to commit crimes or sow chaos - and law enforcement authorities.
Others were suspicious that Hutchins could have created such software.
In July 2014, he asked on Twitter, and no one has a sample of Kronos, which seems to be a strange request when he himself was the author of the malware.
Although the exact details of Hutchins's malware connection are not clear, security investigators have often ignored legal problems when searching for vulnerable areas in the computer code.
In recent years, large technical companies have put in place "problem money" to formalise the process of reporting problems for researchers and compensating for their work.
The Defcon conference, the unlimited gathering of security experts from all over the world, has also had an intense relationship with law enforcement agencies.
In 2002, the FBI arrested a Russian encryption expert in a hotel room in Las Vegas, for example, after publishing software that, according to the authorities, could damage the security of certain types of e-books.
In his statement, the Digital Fronter Foundation said that he was concerned about the arrest of Hutchins and was looking into it more closely.
WannaCry's ransom infected computers with older versions of Microsoft Windows.
After its spread, it encrypted software on computers and locked user files, folders and disks.
If the infected device was connected to the network, other devices on the network may have been infected.
The attackers demanded that the victims pay hundreds of dollars to the bitcoin address.
Hutchins became a so-called random hero.
The interview to the Guardian in May told Hutchins that he registered a web domain after discovering that malicious software was trying to connect with it.
By registering the domain for $10.69, he launched a so-called kill switch that stopped the software from spreading.
His original intention was not to stop the attack, but to monitor its spread.
Hutchins, who works as a Kryptos Logic investigator at a cybersecurity company in Los Angeles, said that he did not attend college and has learned how to write software himself.
The company did not provide its comments.
Hutchins tried to remain anonymous, interacting with the media through his grip on the MalwareTech, but the British tabloids revealed his identity.
He was praised in the cybersecurity community for this achievement and received special recognition for the SC Awards Europe industry event.
The Senate confirmed Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets, as ambassador in Britain.
Johnson was the largest financial supporter of Trump during the presidential campaign and was appointed financial manager of his inauguration committee in November.
The long-term Republican donor Johnson also helped to raise money for George W. Bush, John McCain and Mitt Romney, when they were party candidates.
He used to be a financial manager of Jeb Bush during the 2016 campaign.
Johnson’s grandfather set up a company that produced medical supplies, Johnson & Johnson.
In the past, the United States Ambassador was Matthew Barzun in Britain.
Barzuni appointed Barack Obama in 2013 and he resigned from his post in January of this year before Trump's oath.
The Belgian authorities already knew about the contamination of eggs in June.
"We knew already at the beginning of June about possible problems with insecticide fipronil," said Katien Stragier, the press representative of the Belgian Food Safety Agency, in the VRT religion.
We immediately started an investigation and talked to the D.A. about the case, because it might have been a fraud.
From there, the investigation became secret.
We understand that people have health issues and we try to answer them," Stagier added.
The AFP news agency has been trying to get information from the D.A. in the last few days, but it didn't say anything, because the D.A.J. banned the publication of the information.
Eggs have been removed from the market in Belgium as a precaution until the results of the analyses have been established.
Millions of Dutch eggs withdrawn from sale in the Netherlands and Germany.
The German Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt has invited officials from the Netherlands and Belgium to clarify quickly.
"No one has obviously contaminated eggs with a criminally banned product," said Schmidt to the German newspaper Bild.
According to the Estonian Veterinary and Food Office (VTA), eggs contaminated with pesticides produced in the Netherlands are unlikely to be present in Estonia.
"We do not have Dutch eggs in Estonia," said VTA's press representative Martin Altraira BNS.
He added that there were no other products produced in Estonia from Dutch eggs.
According to Statistics Estonia, eggs have not been imported from the Netherlands in the last 10 years.
Last time, eggs were imported from the Netherlands to Estonia in 2006.
The Dutch authorities suspect that the pesticide fipronil reached the canals following the attempt by the Dutch company Chickfriend to treat the chickens suffering from the disease.
The Dutch and Belgian media reports that the substance containing the pesticides reached Chickfrienden through the Belgian company have not yet been confirmed.
According to the World Health Organization, fipronil is a moderately dangerous substance in larger quantities and can have a negative effect on people, especially children, kidneys, liver and thyroid glands.
Is there finally a solution to avoid boring robotic calls?
For Michael Rizzo, answering the phone is often a waste of time.
His Sports City Pizza Pub, in Buffalo, New York, depends on customers calling and ordering chicken wings, pizza and potato pilots.
But most of the time, it's about automatic messages trying to pull through fraud.
"It's getting there so far that it won't allow any other callers to catch us," said the 24-year-old bar owner.
Help is on the way, though slowly.
Over the last year, new tools have been added to mobile phones, with government inspiration, to prevent unwanted "robot calls".
The Federal Communications Commission has proposed allowing telephone companies to block more spam calls and hopes to scare fraud with large fines.
According to the experts, these steps are not the final solution, but they are a good start.
Federal and state-owned non-voting lists should protect people from unwanted calls from remote distributors.
But traitors don't care if they break the law.
Cheaters reach people cheaply and easily using "auto-choicers" that automatically make a lot of calls at the same time.
It is estimated that the Americans receive tens of millions of robotic calls a day.
Of course, not all of them are fraudulent.
Pharmacies send, for example, automated messages on how to fill your prescriptions.
But too often, the situation is as follows: You owe money to the tax authorities; Microsoft calls to fix your computer; free cruises are offered!
In addition, spam speakers use complex technology that shows a local or important-looking number on the phone, such as the tax administration.
The implementation of appropriate measures for "stealing" numbers would make fraud more difficult and would help consumers in the United States to save millions of dollars, as stated in the FCC document by the State Attorney General Group.
Phone companies and independent applications are capable of screening or blocking unwanted calls compared to known databases of problem numbers and analysing suspicious behaviour, such as a number that calls many people on non-speakable lists.
Wireless service providers also have tools that add such warnings to incoming calls as "likely fraud", but are not available on all phones or to many customers with prepaid cards.
They can be ordered from Verizon and Sprint for an extra fee.
Some Android phones, including Google Pixel, are screening spam calls for free.
Multimedia producer Jen Vargas (39) from Orlando, Florida, said that his AT&T app labeled and blocked certain fraudulent calls on his cell phone, but he has given up on telephone lines.
"I rarely receive calls from numbers I don't know," said Vargas.
Apps such as YouMail and Nomorobo offer free, but limited relief for home phones.
In the case of YouMail, the operator must allow "conditional call directing", which will direct the calls if the line is not answered or if it is busy.
Nomorobo is not available for all home telephone service providers and does not work on older copper-based telephone lines.
It is also possible to buy widgets, some of which are rather sticky, which block calls on home phones.
Verizon also tests the display of warnings on suspicious calls on home phone numbers.
Phone companies are already able to block certain calls that are fraudulent.
The FCC has proposed rules to formalise such practices and allow for the blocking of other suspicious calls.
This means that Verizon may block a tax-free number which receives payment for calls, but never initiates any.
Operators would also be able to block calls in which they know that they are not legal, e.g., 911-coded numbers.
These rules still need to be finalised.
Maureen Mahoney, a public policy aspirator in a non-profit-making consumer union, said that these developments are 'supervising', but do not protect consumers from all unwanted calls.
Firstly, non-speakable lists do not apply to certain types of callers, such as debt collectors and political campaigns.
In addition, according to Mahoney, FCC rules would cover only counterfeit numbers.
Not all robot calls are meant to cheat.
The Consumers' Union wants telephone companies to make their call blocking tools available free of charge to all consumers.
In the longer term, the FCC will support the industry's efforts to confirm that the caller is indeed the one who claims to be.
Perhaps one day you can see a green bird on the smartphone screen if the caller is legal.
U.S. Telecom says it may take several years to put it into service, but it would be a powerful tool against robotic speakers.
The FCC is also looking for ways to stop boring calls from following consumers who change numbers.
If you register now in a non-speakable list, but later get yourself a new number, the distributor may not know it and may start to bother you on the new line.
"Robot speakers will not disappear anywhere," said Aaron Foss Nomorobos, a service for blocking calls for mobile and home phones.
"They're criminals and they find a new way to get past any system.
But our job is to make it as complicated as possible for them."
There are several logical measures that consumers should take.
Don't answer the phone if you don't know the number.
Yeah, unfortunately, it's not practical for corporate phone calls like in Sports City.
Cancel unwanted calls.
Do not speak back or press any buttons.
If you interact with them, they can identify you as someone who reacts and bury you in more talks.
If possible, block the number after the call.
Use call blocking applications.
If you have concerns about privacy, check the application rules to see if your voice or contact information is shared with distributors.
Do not provide telephone calls with personal information such as bank account or social security number.
Rasmus Mägi: preparation has not gone quite the way I saw it in my eyes
"Not everything has been exactly the way I saw it in my eyes," said Mägi MMi about previous trainings.
Friday-Sunday is an important moment that shows how the body is exactly.
And the competition will show us what we're going to analyze here anyway.
Today, I believe that my preparation has been high-quality, both this year and in previous years, so that it is possible to run normally.
Nothing special has taken place on Sunday according to Estonia time 13.05 after the home championship, the pre-run Mägi started.
In recent weeks, training is often carried out too often.
I should have some freshness, and it might be very useful that the last week before the MM was a little easier.
The days left over from the physical side are like this: yesterday the obstacle runner rested, today is a warming exercise.
However, he does not want to go far into his spiritual preparation: "Because I have in time developed my own routines.
There's a lot of silence and peace and no rock music I'm not gonna put on my ears.
I do not need to watch any motivating videos or read self-help lessons, but to be here and at this point to assess the possibility that athletes from all over the world have come together to compare their abilities in one place.
This, by itself, creates a speciality.
The MM has, of course, been the top event of the year for every light-powered player, and Mägi has tried some technical nuances, compared with some competitors for every previous start, including the Temant League.
There's no chance for an experiment at the title contests anymore.
"There's a purpose just to run fast," says Mägi, but it adds that if the pre-driving and potentially even semi-finals manage to keep up even a percentage or a few energy reserves, they will certainly benefit from the next run.
The Finns had a dance for their men.
When the first men's dance was held in Rakvere 11 years ago, the organizers probably never dreamed that the northern neighbours would set an example from a small town in Estonia.
Today, however, the first Finnish men's dance will be held in Lappua, West Finland.
"The representatives of the city of Latvia were so excited about the men's dance in Rakvere, the last friendly city, that they wanted to organize something similar," said Kairit Pihlak, the Deputy Mayor of Rakvere.
"This is how 2 performances will take place in Lapua's baseball stadium in Finland today in the course of the 100 festivals of Finland, including 100 men from Virumaa," said Pihlak.
According to the Bible, this is an excellent example of good cooperation between the two cities of friendship.
It also celebrates the jubilee years of the Republics of Estonia and Finland.
Among the hundred dancers there are also Rocket 69 winners of the previous season in Karl Rimeubja.
"I have the honor of being one of the 100 men who, with their participation in Finland, show what Viru's men are capable of," he said.
"The men dancing with Rakvere have put all their joints in order to show a proper level with the northern neighbours in preparation for the Finnish men's dance," commented Ain Suurkaev, a member of Rakvere City Government.
The performance of Virumaa's men has been completed by the art director of Tarvanpää, Tiiu Poison, together with the well-known choir leader Elo Ülioja.
Estonian choreography is based on Estonian choir music.
The first Estonian men's dance was held in 2006, while the last one was in Rakvere in 2015.
At the end of the evening's disc emissions: does Gerd Kanter make MM history?
The current World Cup is the eighth for Kanter, and none of his competitors in London have reached such a conclusion.
In addition, Kanter is the only disk thrower in history who has won a complete set of medals (gold, two silver and two bronze) from MM.
As of today (5 August 2017), Kanter is 38 and 92 days old.
If an Estonian throws himself twice as world champion, he will become the oldest disk thrower to win the gold medal in the World.
The Polish violent Pjotr Malachowski (34 and 60 days of age) has a similar opportunity.
More exciting facts:
More than once, sportsmen from only two countries have become World Cup of Disk Emissions.
Germany has nine gold medals, Lithuania has two.
The World Championship record belongs to Virgilijus Alekna, which has been cast in Helsinki (in 2005) 70.17.
The lowest result that has been won is 66.20 - this was done by Riedel (1991).
The results of the study show that the cockroaches also spread seeds.
Like birds and mammals, cockroaches spread seeds.
These insects are mainly known as breakers who help to break down substances that fall under the forest.
The peaches, however, also help to spread seeds.
Japanese scientists found that cockroaches play an important role in the distribution of seeds to the hum of the forest species Monotropastrum.
It's an unusual plant.
It does not contain chlorophenyl, therefore it is not capable of photosynthesis.
Instead, the species receives its nutrients from ground-growing mushrooms.
The plant sells small, odourless and pale white fruits to the underworld.
Fruits have very little taste or lack of taste, and Japanese researchers found that bird and mammals are not interested in them as food sources.
Only a handful of vertebrates were consumed by the flesh and the wild peacock Blattella nipponica was the only species that regularly visited the fruits.
The investigators checked the feces of the cockroaches to determine whether these insects would help spread plant seeds.
Scientists found that each fecal tom after eating the fruit contained on average three seeds.
Further tests confirmed that most of the digested seeds were viable.
Scientists assume that this unique plant species has probably learned to exploit the ability to spread peach seeds in the course of evolution.
The plants are hanging near the ground and ripen at the same time as the cockroaches leave their larvae.
Researchers published their findings this week in the Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society.
"In view of the fact that some 4600 species of cockroaches have so far been identified, the distribution of seeds through cockroaches can be a much more extensive and still undocumented mechanism, not a unique skill of a particular plant species," said Naoto Sugiura, co-professor at Kumamoto University.
"It is hoped that public findings will encourage people to pay more attention to the relationship between plants and cockroaches and to look for further examples of how cockroache seeds are spreading."
A childhood friend of Cambridge's Duchess should have had the "right to die"
According to his mother, a child friend with a fatal illness should have been allowed to end his life.
Isobel Kennerley, who was a member of the Duke's gadget group, begged after three years of struggle with a brain tumor that caused him "extreme pain, suffering and loss of dignity" to be allowed to die.
A 34-year-old woman with cerebral paralysis was diagnosed with brain tumours in 2014, but according to her mother, she suffered terriblely before she finally died in May.
Christine Eleey, 65, from Newbury Berks, has called for the amendment of the law that would allow people with terminal illness and mentally competent to "check their death in a manner and timing".
He said that the painful death of his daughter caused a "serious trauma" in him and wanted the law to allow him to put in place a plan that would allow his daughter to die with dignity when her condition deteriorated.
Chinese online sensors play a complicated cat and mouse game
According to the experts, this shift, which may have a large impact on users from researchers to companies, suggests that China is increasingly concerned about the influence of the Internet.
"It seems that restrictions are becoming more intensive, but at the same time the internet is more powerful than ever," said Emily Parker, who has written a book "Now I Know Who My Conrades Are" on internet influence in China, Cuba and Russia.
The restrictions on the Beijing Internet are proportional to the influence of the Internet in China.
According to the experts, China's control has not yet been fully strengthened, and in many cases the game of cats and mice continues.
One day after Apple i tour last week, people began to spread Chinese social media a way to get access to these tools, which are so easy that even a foreigner can do it.
This included the registration of a human application store in another country where VPN applications are still available.
However, the Thursday test shows that China wants to change the game in favour of the cat.
A number of Chinese internet service providers said on Thursday in their social media accounts, websites or emails that Chinese security officials are testing new ways to find Internet addresses for services that host or use illegal content.
If they are found, the authorities will, according to these companies, ask internet service providers to require their customers to stop doing so.
If the customers continue, the service providers and Chinese officials will interrupt their connection minutes.
The Ministry of Public Security did not reply to a faxed request to comment on the matter.
Studies suggest that tens of millions to hundreds of millions of people in China use VPN and other types of software to get past the Great Firewall.
Although blocking foreign television and pornography puts many people away, they present only small challenges to China’s enormously large online internet user community.
The Chinese President, Xi Jinping, has been responsible for new Internet control elements over the years, but has also highlighted technology and the Internet as critical factors for China's future economic development.
Since cyberspace has started to play a more central role in the whole of China, government control elements have developed.
It is difficult to find out the scope of the new efforts, since many users and companies do not discuss them publicly, fearing that the Chinese government will be adversely affected.
Some frequent users have said, however, that it is becoming increasingly difficult to avoid restrictions.
A student who studied in the United States and returned to China for summer vacation said that he was blocked by the local VPN.
According to him, he took this period as a certain form of meditation away from social media and left a message to his friends to explain why he was as though he had fallen underground.
A doctoral student at one of China's universities in environmental engineering said that without Google, research has become more difficult, although the university has found alternative publications that students do not always need the internet.
According to him, he has now found a new way to go past the Great Fire Wall without disclosing what it is.
According to Chinese internet observers, some VPNs are still in operation and China would be able to take much more action to intensify the restrictions.
"We believe that if the government had decided to do so, it would have stopped the use of VPN much more by now," said VPNDada, a website set up in 2015 to help Chinese users find VPNs, a representative.
"If the government had sent out more cats, it would be much more difficult for mice," said the representative who refused to mention himself as a result of the delicateness of the group's work in China.
"It's obvious they didn't do it because they have to leave some room for people or businesses."
China's online restrictions are often cyclical.
The current climate is partly due to the important meeting of the Chinese Communist Party, the 19th Congress of the Party in the autumn.
Five years ago, VPN was hit by unforeseeable interruptions prior to a similar meeting.
Like economic policy or foreign affairs, censorship in China is also part of a complex and often incomplete political process.
Analysts say that government ministries are under pressure from the party in front of Congress to show that they are effective and able to intervene in the event of a problem.
"This is certainly not the apocalypse of the VPNs," said Paul Triolo, head of the global technology department of Eurasian Group.
"A more complex environment for users to navigation and new opportunities and approaches will simply enable China to switch off certain parts of the use of VPN at the selected time and place of Beijing," he said.
At an earlier age, the Chinese population will learn to cope with these difficulties.
Earlier this summer Chinese internet giant Tencent began to limit the time during which younger than 18 are allowed to play a popular online game "Honor of Kings", allowing it to be done an hour a day for those who are younger than 12, and two hours for those who are 12-18.
Therefore, the Chinese young people have started using the evangelical solution - fake documents.
Is your "Honor of Kings" game time restricted?
Are you interested in obtaining a document that shows that you are older than 18?" asked the recent ad in Chinese social media.
"No problem.
Contact me to get a cheap document."
Estonian heavy-duty horses will be assessed in the agricultural museum tomorrow
This Saturday, August 5th, the Estonian Day of Heavy Truck Horses takes place at the Estonian Agricultural Museum.
The Estonian heavy-duty horse is one of the three Estonian horse lifts next to the Estonian horse and tori horse.
The day of heavy horses takes place this year 23 times, and 17 heavy horses across Estonia arrive at the event of the year of work horses.
On that day, young Estonian heavy-duty horses, horses and mussels will be compared and evaluated.
In addition, the work done by the best breeders is recognised.
There are over 350 heavy-duty horses in Estonia at risk.
The conservation of the breed and the use of horses will also be introduced in the High Hormone.
On the same day, it is possible to visit the exhibitions of the Estonian Agricultural Museum, get to know EV100 cereals and rye fields and participate in thematic workshops.
Visitors of all ages will find activity.
There are exciting games for children, the opportunity to ride a pony or a horse, participate in a drawing competition and visit the Three Pigs Science Theatres.
There is also a summer pass offering Estonian food and handicrafts.
The day of Estonian heavy horses is organised jointly with the Estonian Horse Farmers' Society, the Estonian Heavy Horse Farmers' Association and the Estonian Agricultural Museum.
The Estonian Tõulomävatuvatus Liitto is supported by breeders.
A cancerist cat named Genie a year cat
The rescued cat, who was a supporter of its owner during treatment for bone cancer, was named a national year cat.
Genie was recognized for comforting her owner, Evie Henderson (11), from Lincoln, during six chemical sessions.
Evie was diagnosed with bone cancer in March 2016 and Genie’s society helped her cope with several painful surgery and long-term hospitalized time.
The cat recognized the cat charity at the Cats Protection ceremony in London.
Image signature: Evie said the cat was there for her when she lost her long brown hair due to chemotherapy
"I think he's the best.
He deserves it.
He's always been there for me," Evie said.
"He came to my foot in my cast and sat next to my feet.
He smelled the cast and then jumped on the couch to put his paws on my knee.
When I was too sick to visit or go out and sit at home, she came to me and made me happier by offering great comfort."
Evie says she has a special bond with her pet, which was a huge support to her when she lost her hair because of the exhausting treatment.
"It really upset me because I had long brown hair.
But since it was spring, Genie was hairing the same way, and I lost my hair and Genie's own, a little relaxed the whole shock."
Evie's father, Chris Henderson, said that the cat has been "a great distraction" and described how Evie used to watch her favorite videos in a hospital bed.
"Evie was in the hospital for over 300 days, so we spent a lot of time there, and it offered her something to expect when she got home for a valuable day."
11-year-old said, "I missed him every day I was in the hospital, and my family said he missed me too.
He's my best friend, and I really don't know what I'd do without him."
Report: Mueller convened the jury in the Russian-related investigation
The Wall Street Journal announced on Thursday that the jury of the Russian and Donald Trump presidential campaign has been convened by a special prosecutor on possible ties.
The newspaper states that the jury is a new and significant step forward in the investigation of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller as regards whether Trump or his main advisors held a secret advice with Moscow to promote the Republican presidential campaign in 2016.
NBC News has previously announced that before Mueller, a former FBI director who is now in charge of this critical investigation, the state prosecutors had used the jury's collections as part of the investigation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and Trump's former campaign leader Paul Manafort.
One of the president's personal lawyers, John Dowd, told NBC News that he was not aware that Mueller had started using the jury.
"We've been working with Bob Mueller and his team since June 1, because we want to get along with this," he said.
"We have no reason to believe that President Trump is under investigation in the light of the news of the convening of the federal jury."
NBC News has not independently confirmed the data of the Journal.
The use of the jury is a normal part of a complex investigation, and it is not a tool aimed only at listening to the evidence, but also at obtaining information and obtaining data from individuals or businesses.
This is a powerful tool that prosecutors can use to apply for charges and summons, and this could indicate that Mueller's work is far from being done.
Trump has denied that he or any of his team was planning a campaign with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Moscow officials have also denied the role of playing Trump in a surprising victory last November.
Special Adviser to the President Ty Cobb said that he was not aware that Mr Mueller had started using a new jury.
"It's usually secret that the jury is involved," said Cobb in the statement.
The White House is in favour of anything that speeds up the completion of his work fairly.
The White House is fully committed to cooperating with Mueller.
The former FBI director Jim Comey has said three times that the President is not under investigation, and we have no reason to believe that things have changed."
"A flying American" under the black sail
Of course I've heard of "flying" ships.
Who wouldn't be?
After all, several times a day the Tiburs differ between Tallinn and Helsinki.
That's not much.
The Swiss company Supramar introduced the first "foiling" boat, Freccia d'Oro or Golden Arrow to the market in 1952.
The technology was there before, but now I have a wind-moving base.
Catamaran, yes, but still sailing.
What formula is that supposed to take off?
However, let us save ourselves the formula (it is not difficult to find) and let us look at the concept of "filming" by a simple peasant.
Why do planes stay in the air?
The shape of the wing is such that, when the plane continues to ingest at high speed, the air flowing under and above the wing produces an aerodynamic lifting force due to the difference in pressure, at one point it exceeds the mass of the aeroplane and lifts the entire machine into the air.
In essence, the same process takes place in the water.
The right shape of the wing generates the lifting force as it moves forward at high speed, and in turn it lifts the "active" base out of the water.
Easy, isn't it?
It's gonna get complicated when you get to the numbers.
The plane needs a minimum speed of 150-250 kilometres per hour to take off, and the world record of sailing speed is currently "only" 121.1 km/h.
But let us not get involved in high school physics.
Today I have come to see the "flying" catamaran, which bears the name NACRAF20 Carbon FCS.
NACRA will meet with the leading stars of the North-American Catamaran Racing Association.
FCS is a short cut from the Flight Control System.
It is a system that allows the crew to configure the base also in the "flight", and 20 shows the length of the sail in the legs.
As soon as the catamaran is released from cover, it is clear that this is not a gentleman's Sunday sail.
Dr. Monokkel and Captain Sametvest are in the well today.
Pippi and the Glasses couldn't board.
This is hardcore.
It's in the Speed Cube.
"It's a carbon fibre?" I ask by pointing to the sail.
Yeah, it's all carbon fibre.
I don't really get it.
"No, the whole boat", sounds like a little bit of an answer.
170 kilos - the three of us that are going on board will certainly weigh more than 170 kilos in total.
I compare everything from the laundry to the cars until nightfall, and I can't get around it here either - NACRA F20 is like a mistletoe that's not suitable for a street trip.
Damn Zonda R or Ferrari FXX.
Built with one specific goal - to drive well-frequently under controlled conditions.
A lover of horse sailer would also stun the amount of safety equipment to be put on before going to the sea.
Watertight suit, crackers, special grips, sailsuits, cells, special life jacket, helmet.
In combat equipment, it seems that oxygen cylinders, in addition and as well as the sea, could be colonized by Mars.
"There's a great chance of going around?" I ask a funny tone.
"Yes," sounds a short answer.
"You've been around a lot?" I'm gonna hang out.
Okay, that can't be a joke.
I'll fasten the seatbelt, I mean.
It also stresses the fact that the Nacra F20 FCS requires an auxiliary boat and a minimum of two crew members to get to the sea.
Maximum three, so there's not a lot of playroom.
It's starting to wonder why it's not a Sunday cruiser.
Find Forest Storys " Blog Archive " Repair works of lands and roads
At one point in life, all kinds of land improvement work will now inevitably remain in my eye, whether in the forest or in the field.
Machines and work quality have improved considerably, and everything is going to be more powerful than it is in time.
Currently, mainly old land improvement sites are being renovated, errors and congestion are being sought and repaired.
Stronger environmental requirements have been added, which have not been addressed decades ago.
Construction materials have been renewed, for example, plastic tubes are now being used instead of old concrete pipes for the construction of constructions, as well as fabric in addition to stones, the so-called geotextile.
In the past, mouths and drums were secured with cast concrete plates (MP, VKP) and rottings.
In order to protect the environment, sediments that should clean the water from possible residues of agricultural fertilisers and poisons shall be mined before land-based dregs, ditches, etc. are reached into natural streams or rivers.
The new settbains or ponds are often planted with wolves, or they start to grow themselves from the seeds that have flowed there.
The wolves have a capacity to filter out toxic substances from the water.
The pond in the picture was dug last year and this week in the surface of the pond, a concrete ring well was built to take the fire water.
And so that some of the machines don't hit the pond in a hurry, it's likely that's where the big rocks were dragged to the ground.
In addition to cleaning the fields, the improvement of the forest roads is also at hand.
The interforest section in the picture should be part of the freeway, which also becomes an additional crucifix.
The state forest is left to the right, the road to be restructured immediately ahead of the slope and will soon be completed.
There's a private forest on the left.
The main road continues, and there is also the renewal of the fields and roads and the correction of the droughts that have become apparent.
