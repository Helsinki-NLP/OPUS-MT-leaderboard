I've won the horses, sir.
That's what I said, but I didn't mean it.
I told you this wasn't gonna work.
I said no.
Thank you.

I'm sitting next to him.

That was seven or eight years ago, where exactly were you?
I still don't understand anything.
I still don't know why you did it.
I still have a lot of time to have fun.
There's one or two things left to put in the suitcase.

I stopped by today, but you weren't home.
I stopped talking.
I study for about two hours every day.
I study hard at school.
I suggest you talk to Mari.
I suggest you talk to Tom.
I guess you're packed and ready to go.
I must have heard that sound somewhere.
I swear I'll make it up to you.
I swim regularly.
I swim two and a half kilometers a day.
Is your daughter feeling better?
Are you doing dangerous work?
Is your mother home?
Is your mom home?
There's no doubt.
It affects everyone.
It's not over until we're over it.
I'll take his place.
I go on a train every day.
I spoke to Tom a few times.
It's up to you.
It came out of nowhere.
You must be better off with your sister.
It comes with the love I feel for you.
It cost me a lot more than I expected.
The price of this is two euros.
It could be a problem.
It could be expensive.
It would be a shame to see all this work wasted.
He obviously freaked me out.
It's not broken.
I wasn't wrong.
That didn't help much.
The snow didn't stop.
The snow hasn't stopped.
Lets me see if you're coming.
He's not doing anything!
It doesn't matter who started it and why.
It doesn't look that complicated anymore.
That doesn't seem right.
I teach Chinese.
It's like they poured it on me.
I slowly realized that I misunderstanded him.
The last day was snowing.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for your confidence in me.
This was at the beginning of last week.
This is exactly the day of our marriage, dear.
There had to be some reason for this.
It happened all of a sudden.
This happened when he was outside.
It happened to me several times.
Sometimes it happens.
It happens to everyone.
It doesn't taste good.
It's got its own value.
It's raining since Tuesday.
I think every fat man should be on a diet.
I think everyone's hungry.
I don't think he can help you.
I think you'll be fine with your neighbors.
I find your novel boring.
I think there's a couple of movie cubes out there.
I think I can do it.
I don't think I can kill.
I don't think I could kill.
I don't think I understand you.
I feel better.
I think I have the answer.
I think I'll buy it for Tom.
I think I'm dying.
I think I'm losing my head.
I think I'm ready to change.
I think I need more time.
It's like I saw a rat.
I think I have time to do that before Tom gets here.
I think it's better that way.
I think it's right.
It's a very small probability, in my opinion, that you can do it by yourself.
I think he's leaving.
I think it's time for a career change.
I feel like it's time to take a break.
I think it's unfair.
I think that's right.
I think it was Tom who helped Mari.
I think you should leave now.
I think my idea is better.
I think my neighbor might have died.
I think you'll be fine with your neighbors.
I think there's someone at the door.
I think something's wrong.
I find spiders cute.
I think he's at home right now.
I think my idea is better.
I think he's coming.
I think Tom said something else.
I think we should forget about this.
I think that would explain everything.
I'm thinking, so I'm drinking.
I'm thinking, so I exist.
I don't think it makes any sense that we're trying to convince him.
I think you've done a great job.
I guess that's exactly what Tom wants.
I don't think that's enough.
I think this medicine will do you good.
I think time will solve this problem.
I think Tom's been there.
I think Tomi's exhilarating.
I think Tom's still unemployed.
I think Tom must be hungry.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I think Tom needs more.
I think Tamás wants to do it tomorrow.
I think Tom's gonna be able to help.
I think Tamás wins.
I think we can handle it.
I think we need to be patient.
I think we're in the wrong direction somewhere.
I think we should be careful.
I think we're safe now.
I guess you're all cuckoo now.
I think you called the wrong number.
I think you know him.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know what Tamás's girlfriend's name is.
I think you're gonna make it up to him.
I think you look great.
I guess you'd like it.
I think you misunderstood.
I think you should go in in person.
I think you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I think your job is really good.
I think you smell nice.
I don't think you've been convincing enough.
I think you were right.
I was thinking about Tom.
I thought if we went out to eat, it would cheer you up.
I thought I could trust you.
I thought I'd go with him.
I thought I knew her.
I thought it might be worth something.
I thought it was clear what I wanted.
I thought my head was going to explode.
I've been thinking about my future.
I thought it was a good idea to put the key under the towel, but it wasn't.
I thought Tomi was still living in Boston.
I thought you trusted me.
I thought Tom was coming.
I thought Tom was still home.
I thought you were him.
I threatened to kill the neighbor.
That hurts!
It hurts.
I'm under his influence.
I was very impressed.
This is dangerous!
It's a historical play.
It's hard to put it into practice.
It's hard for everyone to get in the mood.
It's hard for everyone to please.
I have doubts as to whether it will work.
It's getting very late.
He's gone.
We're half an hour after midnight.
Some people are hard to understand.
It's high time you start a new business.
It is important that we promote our language in every way possible.
It's basically your fault.
He's in the kitchen.
Wonderful!
It's noon.
This is my bedroom.
We need to prepare for the future.
You need some rest.
It's never too late to learn.
It's good to see you again.
It's not easy to solve the problem.
The smoke detector cannot be turned off.
It's not the best solution.
It's not the right thing to do.
It's not too much to say he's a genius.
It's not a secret.
I'm not the one Tom's having a problem with.
It's not that expensive.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not working.
Maybe he's lying.
It doesn't fit to talk with a mouth full of mouths.
It's snowing.
He's still moving.
Wow, it's really bad today.
It's so expensive.
30 meters long.
It's time to go to bed.
It's too easy for him.
It's up to you.
It's useful information.
The heat's high at night.
It's very important that you wash your hands thoroughly after you change the baby's diaper.
It just didn't work.
It'll be dangerous.
It'll be dark by the time we get home.
It'll be ready by then.
He'll be ready by the time we have to.
It'll take some time to get used to wearing glasses.
He'll be knocking off soon.
It'll work if I change the polarity.
As a result, it looks bigger.
It looks good.
Looks like I'm not needed here.
You could use a shave.
Looks like you're not feeling very well here.
Looks like you've been thinking about everything.
It makes me sad.
That's what matters.
This could be a long time.
Maybe it's a trap.
It can save your life.
Maybe we'd enjoy trying.
I might be late.
You have to wash it.
You have to report something.
It must have been love.
It must have been stolen.
We need to fix it.
He never existed.
It should never have happened.
I lied to her even though I didn't want to.
I told him I'd do the best I could.
I told him to come.
I told Tomi not to give up.
I told Tom where I bought my bike.
I told you, but you didn't listen to me.
I told you, I'm fine.
I told you not to go on foot.
I told you three weeks ago.
I told you you'd like Tomi.
I have a question for you too.
I took a bath for a long time.
I've been in the tub for a long time.
I've arranged it.
I went on route 58.
I was sure you were on our side.
I took my cat to the animal hospital yesterday.
I took my shoes off.
I completely forgot.
It'd probably be cheaper elsewhere.
It rained yesterday morning.
It rained yesterday.
It's raining a lot.
I work two hours a day.
I've traveled all over Russia.
I've traveled to the United States through and through.
It's actually working.
It's really sad.
I tried everything I could to keep him alive.
I tried to forget.
I tried to help Tomi.
I'd trust my life.
I'm trying to keep you informed.
I'm trying to get my thoughts together.
That's a nice flag.
Big-bodied cat.
It's a little early for the drink, isn't it?
It's a boring word.
It's a delicate situation.
It's a dictionary.
Good plan, at least on paper.
A grey stone building.
This is a housekeeper.
It's half an hour till lunch.
It's a hot day.
It's a kitchen knife.
It's all dark out there.
It's all mine.
It's all right, it's over.
That's nice and good theory, but will this work in practice?
It's all your fault.
It's seven o'clock.
It's already in progress.
It's ten o'clock already.
One of my dreams was always living next to a stream.
It's always the same song.
Environmental disaster.
It's a dirty business, Watson, a dirty, dangerous business, and the more I see it, the less I like it.
What a shame.
Too bad I'm late.
Too bad Tomi's leaving.
It's a pretty big weirdo.
It's a nightmare.
It's freezing.
It's just as much art as science.
It's the past.
She's at school.
It's a very dangerous sport, where a slight mistake can lead to serious injury.
It's a very old book.
Waste of money.
That's a weird question.
That's terrible.
It was a crazy week.
It was a long day.
It was an amazing trip.
This day is exhausting.
It's a tough day.
This has happened before.
It's not like it's been a week.
It's been two years since he left me.
That's better.
It's better to spray the garden at night.
Fire heat.
Oh, my God.
Cheaper bus.
This is Chinese for me.
It's closed on Sundays.
Closed every Sunday.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's cold at home.
It's cold.
It's cold outside.
Why don't you get yourself a sweater?
It's common knowledge that the bear likes honey.
It doesn't matter if Tom did it or not.
It's perfectly normal.
All right now.
It's dangerous here.
It's deep in here.
It's delicious.
It's done!
It's easier not to start than to stop.
It's easy to be brave far away.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't like Mari.
It seemed like an eternity to me.
Looks like the bus was late.
That sounds ridiculous.
Looks like it was just yesterday that we went to school together.
Doesn't look like anything's changed.
It looks very strange.
Apparently.
Looks like he's lying.
Looks like Tom's in no hurry.
It's like you don't want this to happen to me.
Looks to me like you're honest.
It seems to me you're wrong.
Looks like we're having an extraordinary guest.
It's embarrassing to be late for a date.
That's exactly what they want.
Oh, dear.
It's only fair if you get the same pay for the same job.
It's not nearly perfect.
It's far from ideal.
It's for you.
You know, that's funny.
It's starting to freak out.
It's getting serious.
We're gonna have a hard time.
It won't be easy.
It's good luck to see a shooting star.
It's good to be gay.
It's good for learning.
I'm so glad you could make it.
I'm sure you're gonna laugh.
It's hard not to come to that conclusion.
It's hard to believe the weather has been clean and sunny all this time.
It's hard to describe.
It's hard to find a bench in this town to sleep on.
It's hard to put it in words.
It's hard to express words.
It's hard to steal a thief.
It's very nice.
He's got a disproportionate head.
High.
The kids are already in bed.
Stop throwing money!
It's warmer than usual tonight.
It's illegal.
It's important.
It is important that parents are on the same page when they are raising children.
It's important to help those in trouble.
That's impossible for me.
You have to drown in here.
You can't breathe in here.
It's impossible to meet your expectations.
It's impossible to meet your terms.
We don't know what tomorrow's gonna bring.
Unbelievable, you know?
This is inevitable.
It's inspiring.
It's just a hunch.
Just outside.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets in trouble again.
It's just a phone.
It's just that I don't want to die today.
It's kind of hard.
That's pretty important.
It's really nice of you to take me home.
It's nice of you to say that.
It's late.
There's a laundry today.
It's like a submerged field, and the turtles, the sharks and the sharks over it, like flying creatures.
It's closed.
It's me again.
It's me again, Tom.
It's me!
It's me.
It's pathetic as you live.
It's too cold to swim.
That's my horse.
This is my life!
This is my life!
That's my problem.
This is my suitcase.
Now it's my turn.
It's never too late to be what you could have been.
It's none of your business.
It's not a bad idea.
It's not a bank.
It's not as watchful as it sounds.
It's not complicated at all.
That's not enough.
That's not gonna happen.
It's not Mennad's job to change Egypt.
It's not mine.
It's not my fault.
It can't be negociated.
It's not that far.
It's not that simple.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not what it looks like.
It's not about what you do, it's about how you do it.
There's no point in whining about it.
I wasn't talking to you.
I wasn't talking to you.
I didn't tell you.
There's no point in confessing to the priest if you don't testify.
It doesn't make sense to be sad about the past.
The snow's on.
It's obviously broken.
It's definitely impossible.
It's obviously weird.
It's obviously very painful.
It's okay if some people think I'm a peasant.
It's okay if you're gay.
“ It’s been three months, and Tomi’s already says that she speaks French liquidly. ”
It's only three days.
It's on the other side of the park.
Sounds good.
It's over, isn't it?
It's over.
It's personal.
It stinks like I'm pouring it out of jujus.
He opened his wings.
That's amazing.
It's pretty convincing.
It's pretty simple.
It is quite clear that these mizanthropod theories are meant to be reflected in the defamation of the working class, exonerating imperialism from the responsibility of the bloody wars it extremises, and believing in the idea that the aggressive tendencies of endless wars are the cause of man’s being born.
It's urgent.
It's raining in my heart.
Few large gardens are located in Japan.
It's real, isn't it?
It's really a big number.
It's over there.
It's rude to ask someone how much you're making.
They say the Czech girls are pretty.
They say they're leaving Tokyo soon.
Shit!
It's just disgusting.
It's snowing here.
It's snowing in Boston.
It's so good to stay home.
He's still moving.
It's suicide.
That's technically possible.
This is the best book I've ever read.
That's the least I can do.
It's theoretically possible.
It's the same for everyone.
Same old problem.
We still have to answer that.
It's time we took our tent tree.
It's time to get out of here.
It's time to go.
Time!
It's time to remedy the problem.
I should have my hair cut off by now.
It's time to rest.
It's time to tell the truth.
It's high time we did something about this.
It's Tom's birthday.
It's Tom's decision.
Tomi's voice is against Mari's word.
It's too dark to play ball.
That's expensive to me.
It's too hot for this.
Too late.
It's too late to worry about that.
It's typical autumn time.
It sucks to get cold.
It's ugly, curly yellow and it doesn't have anything to do with anything, but at least they don't run off in the dark.
It's under the table.
Maybe he's not as stupid as you think he is.
It's unlikely that anything serious will happen.
It's up to them now.
It's up to you to go there or not.
Very attractive.
It's very boring.
It's really cold in this room, isn't it?
It's very disturbing.
Very amusing.
It's gonna take a lot of time to live here.
That's very kind of you.
It's very white.
It's hot.
That's what we agreed on.
It's your only chance.
It takes about 10,000 hours to learn a language thoroughly.
You have to be brave about success.
It took me almost three years to build my house.
It took me nearly three years to build my house.
Everyone got caught by surprise.
It took me an hour.
It took me a lot of time to write this book.
It took me over a month to recover from the cold.
It took Tom a long time to pick a pair of shoes.
It took me a long time to find him.
I turned into a little alley.
I've been working.
I'll turn left.
It was a beautiful summer day.
It was a difficult time.
It was a friendly competition.
It was a mistake to do that.
It was fun.
It was dark in the night.
It was a real challenge.
That was a stupid question.
That was a stupid idea.
It was a tragic accident.
It was really great food.
It was just a waste of time for all of us.
It was so weird.
It was a wonderful day.
It was a wonderful night.
It was a defeat.
It was clearly very enjoyable.
We had a good time yesterday.
It was hard at first.
It was hopeless.
It was hot and wet.
It was hot, and the weather was so humid.
It was just a run-out.
It was just too easy.
I told you.
That's what I wanted.
It was almost dark.
That was shortly before John had an idea. John always knew a way out of seemingly hopeless situations.
It wasn't a very interesting novel.
It wasn't easy for me.
It wasn't easy for me to keep my promise.
That was a low-belt blow.
It wasn't interesting.
I wasn't the one who cut the door.
It wasn't my fault.
It wasn't deliberate.
It wasn't our fault.
It wasn't that bad.
It wasn't the first time they've done this.
It wasn't Tom.
It was a joke.
The only way I could find out what he really meant was when I met him.
It didn't hurt.
It rained last night.
