The members of the Wales National Assembly fear that they look like the Muppets.
Some members of the National Assembly have been surprised by the recommendation to convert their title into MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament or Member of the Wales Parliament).
The theme has begun with the plan to convert the name of the National Assembly into the Wales Parliament.
Representatives of all political trends in the National Assembly are concerned that this may lead to ridicule.
A member of the National Assembly of Laborists said that his groupmates are concerned because it mutters with the words Twp and Pwp.
For explanation to readers outside Wales: the word daft means napkat and pwp means poop.
A member of the board said that the whole group is “not happy” and has proposed other names.
A member of the Conservative Party of Wales said that his group would accept the name change "receptively", but noted that the word "MWP" was very similar to "Muppet".
For an explanation: the word "w" is similar to the word "u" in the English language of Yorkshire.
The Committee of the National Assembly, which is currently drafting a draft law on name change, said: "The final decision on all the names by which the members of the National Assembly are invited, of course, will be taken by the members themselves."
The Wales National Assembly was granted the right to change its name by law of the Welsh Government in 2017.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public survey on proposals for names, which gives broad support to the idea of re-electing the National Assembly as a Wales Parliament.
As regards the appointment of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission preferred the name ‘WMP Members of the Wales Parliament’, but the participants in the public interview preferred the most option ‘MWP’.
Members of the Assembly are likely to propose other names, but reaching an agreement may be a challenge for President Jones, who should present a draft law on amendments in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation also includes other changes to the working principles of the National Assembly, including the rules on the withdrawal of the rights of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
The final vote on the appointment of the members of the National Assembly shall be held by the members of the legislative process.
The Macedonians will hold a referendum on changing the country's name
The voters will vote on Sunday whether or not their country will be renamed 'North Macedonia'.
A referendum will be held to resolve the decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its province of Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that the name of its northern neighbour represents the requirement for this territory and has repeatedly objected to the application of the EU and NATO.
President Gjorge Ivanov of Macedonia against the roll-call referendum has said that he intends to ignore the vote.
However, the referendum advocates, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev, claim that the change of name is only the price the country would pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells remain silent because the churches of Harlem are in trouble.
“The older people I've been talking to have said there was one bar and one church on every corner,” said Mr Adams.
"There is no longer either."
He said that the loss of bars is understandable.
“People communicate differently today,” he said.
“Bars are no longer neighbourhood living rooms, where people are present every day.”
However, as far as churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders hope, and “they will be back at the beginning sooner or later”.
Adams added that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings full of people who do not extend help to the remaining churches of the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of those buying apartments in these buildings are white,” he added, “who therefore speed up the day when all these churches close their doors because it is unlikely that most of the people living here will become members of these churches.”
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, the Church of St Martin ten years later.
The original congregation of white Methodists left in the 1930 ’ s.
The black congregation, which had so far worshiped God in the vicinity, took over the property of the building.
At the head of the Afro-American congregation in St. Martin's Church, Reverend John Howard Johnson led a boycott against the main shopping street of Harlem 125th Street when they refused to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when the members of Father Johnson’s congregation planned to restore the building, they introduced a cattle or watch play.
Father Johnson's son and heir to St. Martin's Church, Reverend David Johnson called the shepherd proudly "the bells of poor people".
However, the jubilee, acting as a shepherd, gave it a second name: "cultural value" and "an irreplaceable historical tool".
The expert at Tiffany Ng Michigan University also noted that it was the world’s first cattle played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who continued to play a larger cattle 18 years ago in the Riverside Church.
Mr Merriweather said that the Church of St Martin did not replace him.
What has been playing in St Martin’s Church in recent months has been a story of architects and contractors, some of whom have been involved by secular leaders of the church, others by bishops.
In July, the congregation governing body of secular leaders in the church complained to the bishops in writing that the bishops “received to pass on the costs,” although the presidency was not even involved in the hire of the architects and workers sent by the bishops.
Some of the members complained about the poor transparency of the bishop’s actions.
In California, shark injured a 13-year-old lobster boy.
According to the authorities, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who dived into California on the opening day of the lobster season after the lobsters.
The attack took place just before seven o'clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB-TV that he and his friends had been diving for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cries for help and then swam over there to help the boy get out of the water.
Hammel said that he initially thought that the boy expressed his enthusiasm for receiving the lobster, but “he then realized that he was screaming,“ I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
Hammel described the sight he saw when he arrived at the boy.
"I called on everyone to come out of the water," Hammel added.
In a life-threatening situation, the boy was taken on a plane to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego.
The species of the attacked shark has not yet been known.
The rescuer and Captain Larry Giles said at the press conference that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but then it was established that it was not a dangerous species of sharks.
Giles added that the victim's injuries were at the top of the body.
For 48 hours, the authorities closed down access to Ponto Beach, Ecinitas, from Casablanca to Swami, for research and safety purposes.
Giles added that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury plans to take over the UK beauty market
In Sainsbury, he takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains, setting up a supermarket for beauty products, where expert advisors also work.
As part of an important invasion of the United Kingdom’s GBP 2.7 billion beauty market, which, as the sales of fashion and household goods continue to be on the rise, 11 stores of beauty products will be tested on a wider scale and will, if successful, be introduced in other shops next year.
The investment in beauty products is because supermarkets are looking for ways to make use of the shelf space previously allocated to televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said that it intends to double the range of its beauty products up to 3000 products, including, for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw.
Existing product selections from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in brand areas such as those currently found in Boots' stores.
The supermarket also brings back its series of make-up products Boutique, where most products are suitable for vegans, as young shoppers increasingly demand.
In addition, Fragrance Shop, a perfume retailer, is experimenting with the exclusive sales license in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second is opened this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Shopping online and switching to daily shopping for small quantities of food from local grocery stores means that supermarkets must try more to convince people to visit them.
The CEO of Sainsbury, Mike Coupe, has said that sales places are becoming increasingly similar to supermarkets, as the supermarket chain is trying to fight against low-cost chains such as Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and industrial goods.
In Sainsbury, Argos has put sales places in hundreds of shops. The same has been done with the sales venues in Habitats, since both chains were purchased two years ago in Sainsbury, which allegedly supported the sale of food products and made acquisitions more profitable.
The earlier Supermarket attempt to upgrade its beauty and treatment departments ended with failure.
Sainsbury tested joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended with a row about how to share the proceeds of selling pharmaceutical goods in supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after 281 sons in Sainsbury sold their pharmaceutical business for GBP 125 million three years ago to Celesio, the whole Lloyds Pharmacy trading chain.
The strategy also plays its role by including luxury skin care products in the product range of its four stores, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Sainsbury’s Business Manager Paul Mills-Hicks said: “We have changed the appearance and nature of our cut-offs for beauty products in order to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also spent money on special training workers who are always ready to advise.
Our brand selection meets every need. However, the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a competitive destination for beauty trade, which can change old shopping methods."
Peter Jones is mad because Holly Willoughby gave up a 11 million dollar deal.
Dragons Den's star Peter Jones left the “murder” when TV host Holly Willoughby gave up a 11 million-dollar deal in his lifestyle brand business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby lacks time for Truly's brand of household goods and clothing.
A couple of business is comparable to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
The 37-year-old TV show “This Morning” announced its departure in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den's star into Peter Jones's anger by stepping out of their luxury lifestyle branding activities at the last minute to focus on her new successful contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources said that Jones was “murdered” when the TV stargirl admitted at a tense meeting at Marlows Buckinghamshire, the headquarter of the man’s business empire on Tuesday, that his new contracts worth £1.5 million mean that she no longer has enough time to devote herself to the brand of household clothing and clothing, Truly.
The company is compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow brand, Goop, and it was thought to double Willoughby's estimated assets of GBP 11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced in Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain for a holiday home.
One source said: “Truly was certainly Holly’s top priority.
It was supposed to secure his distant future, so she thought she was doing it for the next few decades.
His decision to leave left everything in total disillusionment.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday because it was so close to placing the product line on the market.
There's a warehouse in Marlow's headquarters full of ready-to-sale goods."
Experts believe that the departure of one of Britain’s most paid celebrity TV shows “This Morning” can cost the company millions, because products with a choice ranging from sofa pillows and candles to clothes and household clothes have been invested in a very large amount of money.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and Dan Baldwin, the mother of three children, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016. 52-year-old Jones joined the brand as chairman in March.
Couples go on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's teleproduction company.
Willoughby becomes M&S brand broker and he replaces Ant McPartlin's ITV TV series "I'm A Celebrity".
One of Jones' close sources said last night: "I don't want to comment on his business."
It's hard to talk, "because of what we fell in love"
Trump was joking about the criticism that was directed in the news to him for a comment that some consider to be "deservable to the President" and about the excessive positiveness of the North Korean Head of State.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said with his mocking "new anchor voice":
"I have given up nothing."
He noted that after Trump welcomed their first meeting in Singapore in June, Singapore, as a major step towards a ceasefire of North Korea's nuclear weapons, he was interested in a second meeting.
However, negotiations on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons have stopped.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea would not see the US as a "equivalent response" to the initial disarmament actions in North Korea.
It noted that the US would continue with pressure-restricted restrictions in the future.
Trump's stimulating speech angle was much more lively.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“ North Korea was about to start a war.
Millions of people would be dead.
Now we're all very well."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced good results: the rocket attempts have been completed, the hostages have been helped to release and the remains of American servants have been arranged to bring them home.
He also defended his unusual communication with Kim.
"It is very easy to be president, but instead of allowing 10,000 people to wait outside to get to that full-blown stadium, it is better if we have nearly 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd facing us.
The tsunami and earthquake will destroy Indonesia's island by killing hundreds of people
When the consequences of the Lombok earthquake were eliminated, foreign NGOs were told not to need their help.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population had to be relocated, a national disaster, a prerequisite for international assistance, was not announced.
“They often express very clearly that they do not want international assistance, so the stories are a little complicated,” said Mrs Sumbung.
While the organisation Save the Children put together a team to go to Palus, it is not yet clear whether foreigners can work in the region.
Mr Sutopo, the press representative of the National Disaster Office, said that the Indonesian authorities will assess the situation in Ask to decide whether international authorities will be allowed to contribute to assistance.
Given the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is surprisingly low prepared to deal with natural forces.
Although shelters for tsunamis have been built in Aceh, they are not very widespread in other coastal areas.
Although the tsunami was given a warning, the apparent absence of the tsunami alert siren increased the number of likely deaths.
Traveling between the numerous islands of Indonesia is also quite challenging in the best times.
Natural disasters make logistics there even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which has stopped in Lombard to treat the victims of the earthquake, is heading for Palus, but it takes at least three days to reach the new accident site.
President Widodo turned Indonesia's fragmented infrastructure into a central part of its electoral campaign and has distributed money on the roads and railways.
However, the budget deficits threaten Mr Joko's government, as the new elections will be held next year.
Mr Jokot is also under pressure from the tensions in Indonesia among the friendly, where members of the majority Muslim community have turned to a more pre-religioned form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands left their homes because of the fighting between the Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets, using machetes, bows, and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge hits the fig gate against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool's defeat in Chelsea Premier League, vibrating the status of 89 minutes in Stamford Bridge, London's Saturday game.
Sturridge was fed by Xherdan Shaqir, about 27 meters from Chelsea Gate, when his team led 1 : 0.
He hit the ball to the left before he hit it in the direction of a further post.
The ball flew high above the penalty area and hit the top right of the net.
It fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabala and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get this position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq give the ball as much as possible, so I just tried to win as much time as possible for myself,” said Sturridge on the LiverpoolFC.com page.
"I saw Kante coming, I made one touch and gave a longer thoughtless blow."
At the end of the first half, Chelsea 1 : 0 was led by 25 minutes thanks to the gate hit by the Belgian star Eden Haard.
The Blues attacker fed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic in this game before he turned around on the midfield and threw it at Liverpool.
Kovacic gave fast food in the middle of the field.
Then he struck a beautiful air-breed, leading her to the Penal Area.
Hazard got through the defense and put the ball on the net with his left foot from Liverpool’s player, Alison Becker, on the further way to the remote post.
Liverpool will play with Naples in the League of Masters sub-group on Wednesday at 15.00 Stadio San Paolol in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea is facing the Videoton UEFA Euro League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of people killed in the Indonesian tsunami rose to 832.
The number of people killed in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, said the state disaster department on Sunday morning.
A number of people were trapped in the cracks of buildings that collapsed due to the 7.5-magnite earthquake that caused the giant waves that took place on Friday and led to the 18-metre giant waves, said the press conference of the pressman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was buried under collapsed buildings.
The police will arrest a 32-year-old man with a murder suspicion after he's stabbed his wife dead.
The murder investigation started this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 07:55 a.m. Grayson Mewsis on John Street. A 32-year-old man has been arrested for murder.
The police call upon them to contact people who were moving in the area who might have seen or heard something.
Police Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is just at the beginning, but I would ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead to contact us and heard or saw something suspicious.
I would also ask all cab drivers, especially those whose on-board cameras might have recorded something, to contact us because they may have information essential to our investigation."
The police spokesperson confirmed that the woman found in a building was a local resident of Birkenhead.
This afternoon, a woman’s alleged friends came to the scene and asked questions about where she was found in the morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police said they're about to inform the wife's next of kin.
The cab driver in Grayson Mews wanted to go back to the apartment, but the police told him no one could enter or leave the house.
The man was shocked to hear about the case.
The residents were told that it might take hours to get back to their house.
The police officer said to one man that the whole area is now being treated as a crime scene.
There was a woman at the scene who was tearing down.
He kept saying, "It's terrible."
At 2:00 p.m., two police buses were still in a closed area and the third was right next to it.
A number of police officers were standing in this area, monitoring the apartment building.
Anyone with information about the event will be asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call the number 101, or contact Crimestors anonymously by phone 0800 555 111, using the keyword 30 September log 247.
The shape of Parliament, Cromwell, is the last monument, which is the cause of the "historic rewriting" dispute
Removing this would be a poetic justice for the destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious objects in the Taliban’s style by the men’s inhumanly persecutive followers.
But Cromwell's association described Mr. Crick's recommendation as a folly and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, Chairman of Cromwell’s Society, said: “In the current debate on the removal of images, it was impossible to remain intact before Oliver Cromwell’s Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not loot the images of the English civil war himself, nor did he tell others to do so.
Maybe they sacrificed the wrong Cromwell man's ancestor, Thomas, for the actions of the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent presentation by Cromwell is proof of the 19th century opinion and part of the historical description of the person who, in the opinion of many people, should still be respected."
Mr Goldsmith said to the newspaper The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people thought at the end of the 19th rather than today, that Cromwell Parliament was a defender of external pressure and, of course, in this case, the royal power.
Whether this is a precise reflection is an endless historical dispute.
It is certain that the conflict in the mid-17th century has shaped the further development of our people, and Cromwell clearly represents this gap on one side.
His achievements as the Master Defender also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated."
The killer smote the Chinese farmer to death.
According to local media reports, the farmer who killed the man was attacked on the market in South China.
A man identified as Yuan with only his last name was found dead and blood-covered by an artillery near the liupanshui market in Guizhou, reported the South China newspaper "Morning Post" on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, a pig keeper was prepared in Xiningi Qinghai province, China, to vaccinate pigs at his desk.
It was alleged that on Wednesday he and his cousin had come from Yunnan, neighboring province, to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the husband’s cousin found him dead, and discovered that the next - handed splinter was open.
He said there was a big splinter with a bloody mouth.
The judicial investigation confirmed that the 249,47 kilograms of originals had, according to the report, killed the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were all bloody and bruised,” reported the words of the cousin Wu, the victim of the newspaper “Guiyang Evening News”.
The security footage showed that Yuan entered the market at 04:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig was locked up so he couldn't attack anyone else until the police collected evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market leaders are allegedly discussing the payment of compensation for the death of a man.
Although rarely, it has been observed in the past that pigs attack humans.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm. The man was seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 294,83 kg nailed the Welsh farmer’s tractor until the husband’s wife scared the animal away.
When one of the farmers of Oregon ate his own pigs in 2012, one of the farmers of Manitoba told CBC News that the pigs usually don't attack, but because of the taste of blood, they could get away with it.
“They’re just playful.
They're very curious maracrats whose aim is not to hurt.
They just have to be respected enough," said the man.
The afterwinds of Hurricane Rosa bring extensive rains in the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to be weakened, moving across the north coast of Mexico toward cooler waters.
Nevertheless, in the coming days Rosa will bring the rainstorms flooding in North Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Sunday morning at 05:00 east coast time, Rosa was classified as a first - category hurricane with winds of 136.78 miles an hour, 619.59 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a low pressure station will be formed over the Pacific, heading east towards the west coast of the United States, and when Rosa approaches the tropical storm on the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, it will be heading deep tropical humidity towards the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will arrive in Mexico, where it rains up to two and a half inches [25.4 cm] of rain.
The tropical humidity that reacts to the approaching low pressure will then cause extensive rainfalls in the southwest of the country in the next few days.
At times, the rain from 2.54 to 10.16 centimeters causes dangerous fires, flood water and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes an increase in rainfall between five and about seven and a half centimeters per hour, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is also expected that 5,08 to 10,16 centimeters of rain in certain southwest regions of the United States, especially in Arizona.
Sudden fires are possible due to the dispersal of tropical rains with rapidly worsening conditions.
Certainly, if tropical rainfalls are threatened, you should not walk in the desert.
A strong rain can cause canyons to turn into high - current rivers and lightning storms are sometimes accompanied by an outbreak of windstorms and volatile dust.
At some point, the approaching low pressure brings with it acute rainfalls in the coastal regions of Southern California.
It is possible to have a total amount of rain that exceeds 1.27 centimeters and can cause smaller flooding and slippery roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region during the rain season.
The scattered tropical rainfalls begin to approach Arizona late Sunday night and early Monday morning, and rainfalls become extensive on Monday night and Tuesday.
Strong rains reach Four Corner on Tuesday and stay until Wednesday.
In October, the United States is predicting large temperature fluctuations caused by Arctic cooling, while temperatures in tropical areas remain high.
Sometimes it causes major temperature changes in small areas.
The daily weather represents an excellent example of significant temperature differences in the central part of the United States.
The temperature differences between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) range from almost 20 degrees.
In the next few days, he's trying to get back together in a long summer heat.
A large part of the central and eastern parts of the United States is expected to start in October with a wide range of temperatures around 80 hot wires from the south to the north-east of the country.
In New York, 26.6 hot wires are expected on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that the likelihood of high average temperatures in the East of the United States in the first half of October is high.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial was attended by over 20 million people.
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday, through six television channels, the confessions of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the alleged sexual violence accused her of being indicted by Christine Blasey Ford in the 1980s.
At the same time, the political impasse continued, in which broadcasters interrupted the presentation of traditional broadcasts to reflect the last minute's turn: Senator Jeff Flake, Arizona, prepared a contract for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Legal Commission that it was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh grabbed him drunk with his head and tried to pull his wife's clothes off at the high school prom.
Kavanaugh said in his passion that he was absolutely certain that it did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people visited the transfer on Friday according to Nielsen’s report.
The company calculated the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels showing this, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also usually has problems calculating the number of people who are watching transfers by the authorities.
To compare, it's about as big a audience as it is at football finals or Oscars.
The opinion leaders of Fox News Channel, who have strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led all networks with an average of 5,69 million viewers in a full-day session, said Nielsen.
ABC 3,26 million viewers stayed in second position.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, said Nielsen.
Even after the trial, the interest remained high.
Flake was the central character of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office submitted a statement that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught a man on Friday morning when he had been subjected to a protest by protestors, attempting to go to a meeting of the Legal Commission with the elevator.
He stood down for several minutes when he was accused and transferred directly to CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
He was told: “You have power, while so many women are completely powerless.”
Mr Flake said that his department issued a statement and added, before closing, that he had more to say at the hearing of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
The cable and broadcasting networks reflected live transmission several hours later when the Committee on Legal Affairs had to vote to send the appointment of Plannaugh to the Senate for the vote.
But Flake said he'd only do it in the understanding that the FBI will investigate next week's charges against the candidate, which have been demanded by minority Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced to have a conversation with Senator Chris Coons about a friend's Democrat.
After a later conversation with Coons and other senators, Flake made his decision.
The Flake decision had an impact since it was obvious that the Republicans would not get the votes of Kavanaugh without confirmation of the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation in connection with Kavanaugh's accusations.
British Prime Minister May accuses Brexit of critics in a political game
The Prime Minister accused those who criticized his plans for leaving the European Union, of the Sunday Times, of "political play" with the future of Great Britain and harming national interest.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with the newspaper Theresa May, with former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, on the front page, Johnson pressured his attack on May’s so-called Brexit’s cable plan, saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other’s tariffs is “all-brainless”.
Shooting Wayde Sims: The police arrested Dyteon Simpson as a suspect in the murder of a LSU player
The police arrested a man suspected of shooting Wayde Sims, 20-year-old LSU basketball.
Twenty-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and placed in prison for the second degree murder charge, said Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities published a video of the resistance between Sims and Simpson, and the police added that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on the CBS television channel WAFB.
After I interviewed Simpson, the police said he confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
The lawyer stated that the male bail was set at USD 350 000 (308 600,30).
The East Baton Rouge coroner issued a preliminary report on Friday saying that he was killed in the head of the neck.
The department thanks the State Police Task Force of Louisiana, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and the people living in the region for their assistance in the investigation, which led to the arrest of a suspect.
The sports director of LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the law enforcement bodies in the region for "secure and justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
A 1,98-metre man grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball in LSU.
The average of his previous season's games was 5.6 points and 2.6 tableballs.
On Friday morning, the LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the entire team was "cut" and "shot" due to Wayde's death.
"This is something you worry about all the time," Wade said.
Volcano bursting ashes over Mexico City
The ash from the volcano called Popocatepetl has reached the southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday, telling them to stay away from the volcano, since the crate again started to operate, resulting in 183 cases of gas emissions and ash outbreaks recorded within 24 hours.
The center was roaming a number of storms and tremors.
The pictures shared in social media represented ash - covered car fronts in different parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimillco.
The geophysics noticed an increase in the activity of 72 km south-east volcano in the capital after the 7.1 Magnificent earthquake struck the central part of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police are colliding with Catalonian separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona following the conflict between the protestors of independence and the riot police. Thousands joined anti-violence demonstrations to celebrate the counter-Katolonia's counter-election vote.
A group of masquerading fighters who held back the riot police attacked the last of the eggs and powder paints, creating thick clouds of dust on the streets, usually filled with tourists.
There was also a time when the police had to use knives to control the fights.
Many hours of no oblivion, no forgiveness, the supporters of independence collided with protestors in favour of the unity of the country who called “Long live Spain!".
According to the local press, 14 protests involving minor injuries received medical attention.
The efforts will continue to be up in the area of independence one year later, when Madrid declared the referendum on 1 October illegal, but marked by the Catalans in favour of separation.
The voters decided overwhelmingly in favour of independence, although the electoral activity was low, because those who were opposed to resignation had widely ignored the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent the vote before the entire voting stations in the region, resulting in violent conflicts.
Independenceists had spent the night in front of the polling stations on Friday in order to avoid demonstrations in support of the national police.
However, the demonstrations took place, but you had to take the other way.
Narcis Termes, 68-year-old electrician, who participated in the demonstrations in favour of separation with his wife, said that he no longer had the hope of seeing Catalonia alone.
“One of the best moments of our lives took place last year.
I saw my parents crying gladly for the chance to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite the important but small-scale victory in the regional elections in December last year, the parties supporting the independence of the Catalan have found it difficult to maintain the will to do this year, as a number of more well-known leaders have either gone into exile themselves or have been detained and await the trial for their part in holding a referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
A 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Puig, who is recording a demonstration in support of his cell phone, said that the fight was driven by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junquera, one of the nine leaders of the Catalans, who have been in pre-trial prison since last year, announced that he would take part in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Advocating the European Parliament elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the pressures of the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: The man was arrested because the car was ramped to the house
Three men from the age of 33, 34, and 39 were arrested after the house was repeatedly scratched by Londonderrys.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, after British time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said that the damage was done at the gates and the building.
They could also shoot the bow in the direction of the car at some point.
Menga kicks Livingston 1-0 in front of the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston was to win
Promoted Livingston Open Rangers to lead Steven Gerrard to another loss in 18 games during which the man has been the manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's blow proved decisive when Gary Holt raised the level in seconds to Hibernian.
Gerrard will remain undefeated in the first league this season and will face the leading Hearts the next Sunday, eight of whom will be down by eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Euro League.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended his undefeated attack to seven games, while Chief Coach Holt still felt the taste of losing since Kenny Miler's replacement last month.
Livingston loses the chance to bets against visitors.
The Holt team should have been in charge a long time ago before they hit the gate, as their immediate style of play caused Rangers all kinds of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his efforts fell in front of the gate, where Alan Lithgow made efforts to catch Craig Halkett's head over the gate.
The Tugers calmly let Rangers play in front of themselves, knowing that they could cause problems for guests in certain places.
And that's the way the determining gate was hit.
The Rangers gave up the free blow and Livingston had the opportunity to play Declan Gallagher, Robinson and Menga, who took the ball and succeeded in the penalty zone.
By this time the Rangers mostly held the ball, but could not penetrate the defense, so the gatekeeper Liam Kelly side was mostly calm.
The same pattern continued during the second half, although Kelly once forced Alfredo Morelos to protect the gate.
The Rangers' goalkeeper Allan McGregor rejected Scott Pittman's blow and Lithgow shined brightly in another team work in Livingston.
The strike continued to reach the Livingston Penal Area and was consistently kicked out of it. Two of them were also targeted, one for trying to replace Halkett Glenn Middleton, and the other for touching the ball with his hand.
Phenomenal achievement from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaron Stadium
Phenomenal performance and result from Livingston.
Each player was great, crossing the ladder upwards with full expectations.
Their playing styles and players have barely changed since they returned to the top level, but Holt must be respected for his hardship since he arrived.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, providing excellently organized protection, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his back legs throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
No matter whether they were in a good position in the meantime, Gerrard remained under the leadership of a few of them, according to the examples here.
Their last possession of the ball proved to be incomplete: reaching home was only once, which could serve as an alarm clock for the Rangers located in the centre of the table.
Erdogan conflicting reception in Cologne
There were smiles and clouds of anxiety in Berlin on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial German visit to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have been excluded on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan headed to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The largest Turkish community in the city is outside Turkey.
The police referred to security by prohibiting the gathering of 25 000 members of the crowd in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters appeared near it to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan, of whom a large proportion are deaf, also made their voice heard, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to host the Turkish President in their country.
The fighting demonstrations show that the attitude toward the guest has split up: some of the Turks in Germany greet him as a hero, while others despise a man as a self - controlant.
Traffic accident on Deptford Road: cyclists killed as a result of a car crash
In London, a bicycle crashed against a car.
The collision took place on a high-speed road near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, in Deptford, in the south-eastern part of the city at about 10:15 p.m. British summertime.
The driver stopped and the help arrived to give an ambulance, but the man died at the scene.
A few months after the crash, another cyclist died in a collision about two kilometers from the Saturday accident on Childers Street, where the driver who hit the rider fled the scene.
The London police said the authorities are working on identifying a man and informing his family.
The site of the event is closed and the buses are diverted, and drivers of motor vehicles are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six prison officials were injured in the unrest
The prison office reported that six prison officials were injured by the unrest of very safe men in prison.
The peace broke out in His Majesty's Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at about 09:30 after British summer time and has not yet ended.
One of the wings is concentrated in riots involving eight prisoners, involving experts in the riot police.
Prison officials were treated for minor facial injury at the scene.
“ Special - trained prison staff are invited to solve the ongoing case in HMP Long Lartin Prison, ” said the prison press representative.
Five crew members received medical attention due to injuries.
We will not tolerate any violence in our prisons, those responsible will be handed over to the police, and their imprisonment may be extended."
HMP Long Lartin is more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, the warden was informed that he was taken to hospital after the prisoner attacked him.
In October last year, however, a riot police were called into prison to silence the serious unrests during which prison officials were attacked with pool bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden fires (heavy areas may benefit from the hurricane)
The tropical low-pressure unit does not hit Arizona often, but it is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the grueling hurricane Rosa moves across the southwest desert, leading to the risk of sudden fires.
The National Weather Service has already organised the monitoring of sudden fires in the western part of Arizona on Monday and Tuesday, in the south and eastern parts of Nevada, in the south-eastern part of California and the south-eastern part of Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is foretold that Rosa will be heading right over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the area with rainfalls on Monday.
Phoenix National Weather Service stated that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or low - pressure level within a radius of 321,86 km from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane passing 64.37 kilometers from the Arizona border."
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict rainfalls from 5,08 to 10,16 centimeters, which can range up to 15,24 centimeters in the restricted areas of Arizona Mogolon Rim.
In other areas of the Southwest of the United States, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Plain, the rainfall is likely to be between 2.54 and 5.08 centimeters, reaching 10.16 centimeters in limited areas.
The rains of Rosa may be a blessing to areas that tolerate sudden fires, since the region is struggling with drought.
Although the floods are very worrying, such rainfall is likely to be beneficial, as droughts exist in South-East America.
According to the U.S. drought monitor, at least 40% of Arizona is an extreme, or second-largest, drought, reported by Weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa Baja crossing the California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at the hurricane level on Sunday morning with the largest windmills at 6,43 miles [6.43 km] per hour, is now 619,95 miles [619,95 km] south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving at a speed of 19,31 km [19,31 km] north.
The storm comes into contact with cool waters in the Pacific, and that's why it subsides a little.
It is therefore expected that Rosa will arrive on the land of Mexico with tropical storms in the afternoon or the afternoon.
The number of rainfalls in certain areas of Mexico can be high, leading to a significant risk of flooding.
“Baja California to Sonora’s north-west can be expected with a total volume of 7,62 to 15,24 centimeters, reaching some 25,4 centimeters,” said Weather.com.
Then Rosa goes north of the tropical storm in Mexico, reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure unit moving across Arizona and reaching the south of Utah on Tuesday night.
“The danger that comes to Rosa or its consequences is very severe rainfalls in Baja California, the Northwest of Sonora and the Southwest of the United States,” said the National Hurricane Center.
These rainfalls can cause life - threatening floods and floods in the deserts and lands in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests in connection with attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested with a suspected murder after 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Sunday at 04:00 after British summer time.
The victim was taken to a hospital in a "stable" state.
A 17-year-old, 18-year-old, and 20-year-old were arrested at night in the Radstock area in Avon and Somerset, said the police.
Officials ask that any person who may have cell phone recordings be contacted.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “sported” by the Democratic Party “under the evil and the wrath”
"Supporting the Court is a voice against the ruthless and unacceptable tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in his cheering speech in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “sponsored” during the process of his appointment, the Democratic Party “under the guise and hatred”.
Kavanaugh testified to the Congress on Thursday, seriously and emotionally rejecting Christine Blasey Ford's accusations that he attacked her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
At the hearing, Mr Ford also testified his accusations.
On Saturday, the president said that "Americans saw Kavanaugh's glory, quality and courage that day".
The vote for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to appoint one of the most valuable legal experts of our time, who has an impeccable background in the public service," he said to the people in support of West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of the Republic's electoral activity in the interim elections.
“Five weeks have remained one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm actually running," he said.
"That is why I am everywhere to fight for excellent candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are on a mission that aims to "responsible and prevent".
The first main procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's application is expected to take place no later than Friday, said the senior assistant to CNN of the leaders of the Republican Party.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have killed thousands, the number of victims is rising
At least 384 people were killed and many were killed when the giant waves invaded the beach after the severe earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulawes in Indonesia, the authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had come together for the beach festival in Palu on Friday, when during the season a six - foot [6 m] waved to the beach, killing a lot of people and destroying everything that was left in the way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnetic earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people still did their thing on the beach, not immediately escaped, thus remaining victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the press conference of the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, at the press conference in Jakarta.
“Tsunam did not come alone, but took with him cars, logs and houses, wiping everything from the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving at a speed of 800 km per hour on the high seas before reaching the shore.
Some people climbed into the trees to escape from the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to Palu 24 headquarters.
The air photos published by the disaster department showed a number of destroyed buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges and water-circuited mosques.
After the coastal city continued on Saturday.
In the region with 2.4 million inhabitants, there was a wave of earthquakes.
The Indonesian Technology Evaluation and Implementation Agency (BPPT) stated in its statement that the energy released after a severe earthquake was nearly 200 times higher than that of the nuclear bomb that was dropped in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city along the long and narrow Gulf could have increased the tsunami's strength, said BPPT.
Nugroho described the damage as “preferential” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels have collapsed.
He said that the bodies of some of the victims were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were lost.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the damage could be larger in a coastal area 300 km north of Pala, called Donggala, which was closer to the middle of the earthquake.
The reports from Dongala “are completely incomplete and do not contain any information,” Nugroho said.
“More than 300 000 people live in the region,” said the Red Cross in its statement, adding that its team and volunteers are heading to the affected places.
“This is already a tragedy that can get even worse,” he said.
The Agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not notifying the tsunami in the city of Palu, although the authorities said that the waves reached the beach at the same time as the warning was issued.
Amateur cameras in social media have seen a man on the top floor of a building who is alarming the panicously moving on the street below for the approaching tsunami.
A few minutes later, the water wall reaches the beach, carrying houses and cars with it.
Reuters failed to verify the correctness of the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive cut in electricity, which prevented communication in the Palu region and made it difficult for the authorities to organise their rescue operations.
The military has begun sending transport aircraft that help Jakarta and other cities, but the evacors still need food and other basic supplies.
The airport in the city was reopened for rescue operations, remaining closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit the evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of those killed by the Indonesian tsunami increased by more than 800.
That's very bad.
Although the staff of the World Vision from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where they were hidden in the presentation tents set up in their office yard, they saw the pictures on their way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They said you saw many houses destroyed," he said.
That's very bad.
Although the reinforcements strongly started disaster mitigation operations, some complained that workers of foreign aid organisations with high experience were prevented from travelling to Paluss.
According to Indonesian rules, foreign funding, supplies and assistance can only be sent if the accident site is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster at the level of the province,” said Aulia Arrian, a press representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," we can begin to accept international aid, but this condition has not yet been declared."
When the second night came after the earthquake and the tsunami, the friends of the missing people and their families still had the hope that their loved ones would be the wonderful events that would ease the sin of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer well.
On Sunday, the saviors released a woman trapped two days next to her mother’s body in a rubble.
The Indonesian National Sliding Officers coach Gendon Subandono trained two missing Sliding Masters for Asian games that took place in Indonesia at the beginning of this month.
The rest of those trapped in Roa Roa's hotel are his students, added Mr. Manda.
“I have a personal burden as a Senior slider driver,” he said.
Mr. Gendon spoke about how, after spreading the news of Roa Roa Hotel's collapse amongst the Slug-Warker community, he desperately sent WhatsHelp's messages to Ask his competitors who were at the beach festival.
His messages, however, were marked with only one grey bird instead of two blue birds.
"I think that means that the messages did not arrive," he said.
The thieves took EUR 23 585.88 during the execution of the ATM in Newport on the Levees
On Friday morning, thieves stole EUR 23 585,88 from Brink’s ATM staff, Newport’s police station press release.
The driver emptyed the ATM at the entertainment agency and made more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in a press release.
When the man acted, “the other man ran behind Brink’s employee” and stole a delivery bag full of money.
Witnesses saw several suspects running from the scene, wrote a press release, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on the early people will be asked to contact the Newport police by telephone (+01633) 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper takes his new name Ye
The rapper Kanye West turns his name Ye.
On Saturday, when he announced a change in Twitter, he wrote, "Previous Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has been called Ye for some time now, and the man also used his name as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change will take place before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where a man is expected to publish his new album in Yandh.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled his concert “at the time of feeling”, said the author of the show.
In addition to the shortening of the present name of a man, the West has said in advance that it is a word of religious significance for him.
"I think yes" is one of the most useful words in the Bible, which means "you" there," West said earlier, discussing with radio broadcaster Big Boy the name of his album.
“So I am you, and I am you, and it is us.
I changed my name from Kanye, which means "this one", called Ye, which is just a reflection of our good and bad, our confusion, and everything else.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanye West is not the only rapper to play with his name.
Sean Combs is known mainly under the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year the musician announced that preferred names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously worked with West, has also used its name with and without a dash of thought, with capital letters and small letters.
Mexican politician AMLO promises not to use the army against civilians
At a time when the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of the bloody attacks on students, the Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use a military force against civilians.
On Sunday, at Tlatelco Plaza, Lopez Obrador promised that “he will never use an army to control Mexicans”.
The military attacked the peaceful demonstration on the court on 2 October 1968, killing 300 people at a time when all of Latin America were carrying left-wing student movements.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by paying students monthly grants and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for artificial intelligence.
"As China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount allocated to research in this field," said the funder and artificial intelligence operator Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were published after various parts of the US government made declarations on artificial intelligence, although the US does not generally have an official strategy on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, China introduced last year its plan to be the player of the renewal of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start, given that other countries are so behind the US and we are working on the breakthrough of the next artificial intelligence," said Lee.
Double funding would double the likelihood that the next major artificial intelligence achievement would take place in the United States, said Lee to the CNBC this week in the interview.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinnovation Ventures, which financed one of the most outstanding companies of artificial intelligence in China Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked with a system of artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon University that won the best Othello player in America. Later, he was the president of Microsoft Research and Google’s Chinese branch.
Lee recognised previous US government technology competitions such as the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency and asked when the next competition would take place to help identify the next dreamers.
“US scientists have to work hard to get funding from the government,” said Lee.
“China is not the one taking over the Harite, it is the companies,” said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired brilliant scientists from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can help the US to support artificial intelligence efforts.
“I think that people who have received a doctorate in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offered a green card,” said the man.
The Chinese Council of State published the next generation of AI development plan in July 2017.
“The Chinese National Science Foundation provides funding to people working in academic institutions in the same way as the public research fund and other government agencies allocate money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” said Lee.
At the beginning of this year, the US Department of Defence set up a pooled centre of artificial intelligence aimed at involving partners from both industry and educational institutions, while the White House announced the establishment of the selected committee of artificial intelligence.
DARPA announced this month that it had started financing the two-million-dollar initiative AI Next.
But the state research fund is currently funding over $100 million a year for research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the US legislation aimed at establishing a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not been amended.
The Macedonians will vote in a referendum on the change of the state name
The Macedonians voted in a referendum on a Sunday to turn the name of the country into the Republic of North Macedonia, a step which would also resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece, which has prevented the confirmation of the statements of accession to the EU and NATO of Macedonia.
Greece, where it has a province of Macedonia, claims that its name is a requirement for that territory and has prohibited Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on a new name for Macedonia, but opponents of nationalists claim that the name would undermine the national identity of the Slavic people of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he was not going to take part in the referendum and that the rejection campaign raised doubts as to whether the electoral activity would reach the 50% threshold necessary to hold the referendum.
The referendum asks: "Do you support Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU by agreeing to an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that this is the price to be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to ensure the accession of organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of our country and for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protective hand of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us,” said the 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska, who voted in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have said that they will follow the result of the vote in order to make it decisive.
A change of name requires two-thirds of Parliament's votes.
The National Electoral Commission said that there are no reports of irregularities at 13:00.
However, election activity was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko gave their vote in the Macedonian referendum on changing the name of the country, which would give them the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage, raising the chairs of tents to those who did not vote.
“We want to be a member of NATO and the EU, but we want to join the head up, not through the door of the servants,” said Kavandarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become European-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring more than 20 % of unemployment into Macedonia into the necessary investments.
"I believe that a large majority will support the change of name because more than 80% of citizens are in favour of belonging to the EU and NATO," Zaev said after giving his vote.
He said that "yes-word" would be "confirmation of our future".
The results of the survey published by the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies on Monday revealed that 30-43 per cent of voters intend to participate in the referendum, which is below the necessary electoral activity.
The survey carried out by Macedonian Telma TV revealed that 57% of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said you'd answer yes.
The rate of success of the referendum is 50 percent plus one vote.
Failure to hold a referendum would be the first serious blow to the government's Western policy after the government took over last May.
See: Manchester City Player Sergio Aguero goes to the gate through the entire Brighton defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through Brighton's defense, ensuring a victory of Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look like the gate he hit at the 65th minute was ridiculously easy.
The Argentinan attacker passed through the center field at the beginning of the sequence.
He penetrated three Brighton defenders before he got to the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He penetrated another protector before passing several players on the edge of the Brighton penalty zone.
Then he hit the ball to the left where Sterling was.
The English attacker used the first blow to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to hit Brighton Gatekeeper Mathew Ryan to the right of the network.
“Aguerol has problems with his legs,” said Manchester City Manager Pep Guardiola to reporters.
“We talked about him playing at 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he hit the gate at the moment."
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues the initial success of Premier League.
The gate was hit at 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball in this game clearly on Brighton's territory.
He sent the ball beautifully from the air to Leroy Sane on the left side.
Sane was able to hit the ball a few times before leading Sterling further away.
Sky Blues hit the ball right before it slipped out of the border.
Manchester City is playing at 12:55 a.m. at the Rhein-Neckar Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany in the Master League sub-group with Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to play cheery against Rockies
When the Nationals were excluded from the finals tournament, there was no reason for the new start.
But Scherzer hopes to land Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only when Rockiesel, who runs Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, has a chance of getting to the finals.
Rockies guaranteed the first division at least with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but the team still wants to secure its first division.
“While we don’t play for anything, we can at least try, knowing that playing in Denver with this audience and another team is probably at a higher level than any other game I can expect this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete here?"
The Nationals have not yet named a Sunday opening player, but they are supposed to be inclined to Scherzer's meal in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be 34th feeding, took a warm-up session on Thursday and would normally be on Sunday.
This Washington right-handed player will lead from 18 to 7, its ERA will be 2,53, the number of hits 300 and the favourable possibilities of its 220 2/3 in this season.
Trump is giving a cheer call in West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding the election of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, while at the same time talking about the importance of the electoral activity of the Republic in the interim elections.
“All we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before our lifetime, one of the most important elections.
This is an event where I do not apply, but I am actually running. Therefore, I am everywhere to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, terrible, extreme group of democracies, and you see it happening in front of your own eyes.
And they've decided to take back the power of any means.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive over for power and control. The only thing they want is power and control over everything, and we don't give it to them."
According to him, the Democrats are on a mission that is designed to "resist and prevent".
"And you have seen it in the last four days," he said, calling democracies "above, evil, altruistic and false."
He referred to a democratic member of the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was shouted out loud among the audience.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak this document?
Uh, ah, what?
No, no, wait – it was one of the worst examples of body language, in fact, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Laborist Party is no longer a big connection.
This is unacceptable to those who express their opinion
When the activists of my local party Momentum voted to condemn me, it wasn't surprising.
After all, I am the last on the list of Labour Members to whom they say you are not welcome, and all this for the sake of my opinion.
My colleague from Parliament, Joan Ryan, received the same treatment because he was strongly in favour of anti-Jewishism.
In my case, the judges condemned me for not consulting Jeremy Corbyn.
Responsible economic policy, national security and European issues, which are strangely similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The statement by the Labour Party of Nottingham East stated that “we would like meetings to be inclusive and creative.”
Most of my eight-year local Labour Member's experience in Friday evening meetings is exactly like that.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the case for most meetings today, and the promise to be in politics “a better and more generous” has long been forgotten, if ever remembered.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that different views are not acceptable to the Labour Party and that each opinion will assess who is acceptable to the Party's board.
It started just after Jeremy became the leader. The fellow worker with whom I thought I had previously thought I was sharing similar political views now expected me to change my mind and adopt positions that I would never have agreed to otherwise, whether it was a matter of national security or a matter of a single EU market.
Every time I step up in public, regardless of what I am actually saying, it is followed by a condemnation in social media, encouraging my resignation, ignoring party politics, and saying that I should not belong to the Labour Party.
And it's not just my personal experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my fellow workers, because comments directed at me are mostly political.
I admire the competence and decision-making of those fellow workers who face sexual or racist abuse every day, but never swear.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this policy is how abuse levels have become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality, however, is that we are no longer such a large association and that any change in "infidelity" initiative or electoral rules will make the party narrower.
I have been given a lot of advice over the last two years to keep my head down, to talk less, and "it would be all right."
But that's not what I was going to do in politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a school student 32 years ago, motivated by the negligence of the government of Thatcher, which had left the word of my big school classroom literally on the brink of collapse, I have tried to talk about better public services to those who need it most, both as a member of the local council and as a minister of the government.
I have never hidden my policy, including in the last elections.
There is no way that anyone in Nottingham East was confused with my political views or with my local leadership.
To all those who promoted the movement on Friday, I would like to say that if the country is moving towards Brexit, which is damaging households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend my time and energy, being loyal to the head of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not meant for the Momentum of Nottingham, but for my supporters, whether they belong to the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that not one threat of recallation or political consideration will stop me from acting for what I think is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr moves to the top
Two late events may have somewhat tilted the outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win this wonderfully fun Tennent first league game.
They're now the only unbeatable team at the top of the table.
After all, this team had a high level of protection and a better take of risks, which the home team's way of winning and coach Peter Murchiel has a full right to be content.
“We have been tested all the time during the games and are still undefeated, so of course I am happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "I want to tell Ayris, they took advantage of their chances better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th game-minute attempt, taken over by Frazier Climo, gave Ayri a head start, but the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was handed over to the Warriors, gave Melros the opportunity to conduct a failed attempt.
Climo increased Ayri's success by a penalty blow just before the end of the half-life, reaching a single event in favour of Ayri by the end of the half-life period of 17-5.
But Melrose successfully started the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt to take over Baggot reduced the difference by five points.
Then there was a long delay due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knox, after which the man was taken off on the carrier frame. As the game continued, Ayr increased the ground of progress further thanks to Stafford McDowall's test, which was transmitted by Climo.
The Ayur Executive Captain Blair Macpherson was then on a yellow card, but once again Melrose's player paid for the failed transmission of Bruce Colvine's attempt to repress.
However, the team playing in the home field was again in power, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow map of Climo's prevention without a ball on the line of punishment, MacPherson put the ball behind the moving Aures.
Climo gave the ball up, as he did almost immediately after the game continued, when Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's boxing and sent side protection Gregor Henry out on the fifth test of the team playing on the home field.
Still Game Star wants to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game's star Ford Kieran seems to be ready to take up the catering business after it was discovered that the man was appointed director of a recognized restaurant company.
56-year-old actor plays in a TV series known as Jack Jarvis BBC, which he writes and plays with Greg Hemphill, a long-term comedy partner.
The couple have announced that the ninth season to come will be the last of the series and that Kiernan will make a life after Craiglang's new plans.
According to the official records, he is the director of the Adriftmorn Limited company.
The actor refused to comment, but Scottish Sun's source suggested that Kiernan wanted to enter Glasgow's "flavouring restaurant business".
"The sea is ours": the sea-free Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the way for them to the Pacific
Marines patrol the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
The blue flags fly over the buildings of the Authority.
The Marine Bases from Lake Titica to Amazon have been drawn to the introduction: “The sea is our right.
Restoring it is our duty."
There is a memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the 19th century, which is still alive. It is the same living desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are sometimes highest in recent decades, as Bolivia is waiting for the decision to be taken by the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of negotiations.
“Bolivia has a spirit of momentum, unity and peace, and the state is naturally waiting for a positive result,” said the Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
A large number of Bolivians across the country are looking at the decision-making of the international court from the big screens, hoping that the Hague Court will decide in favour of Bolivia, after which Chile will be obliged to negotiate with Bolivia for decades to give the latter an independent path to the sea.
The charismatic President of Bolivia, Evo Morales, who is facing a conflict of election next year, is at great risk by Monday's decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he swore at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will probably not vote in favour of Bolivia, or if so, it would become very little.
The United Nations authority in the Netherlands does not have the power to give up the territory of Chile and it has provided that it does not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The decision of the International Court of Justice only six months after the hearing of the final statements indicates that it was not “a difficult case”, said Paz Zárate, an expert in international law in Chile.
And away from the additional causes of Bolivia, the last four years may have made the situation worse.
“The problem of access to the sea has been robbed by the current Bolivian authorities,” Zárate said.
The morals' military speech has lost all the remains of Chile's charity, he noted.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at some point, but after all this, the debate will be extremely difficult.
Two countries have not changed their ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who is a representative of Bolivia in the Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unwittingly urgent.
On Monday, Bolivia will be "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in its relations with Chile" and "to end 139 years of conflict with mutual benefit", she said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most well-known presidents of Latin America, uses the maritime issue to express political resentment.
“Bolivia will never give up her right to access the Pacific,” she added.
"The ability is to see that we have to get past the past."
North Korea said that the release of nuclear weapons will not take place until the United States can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his people will never give up nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the General Meeting of the United Nations on Saturday.
He called on the United States to review the promises made by the competitors' heads of state during the Singapore Summit.
He comments at a time when the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo almost appears to be reinitiating the impasse of nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Uni in Singapore.
According to Ri, this is airlocks, because the US is continuing to be restricted and refusing to end the war with Korea is putting North Korea in a position to surrender.
Washington is cautious about such a statement if Pyongyang does not take the first important steps towards armament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, scepticism is common, according to which Pyongyang intends to seriously abandon the arms that the state is likely to see as the only way to ensure its own safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to agree on another Kim-Trump summit.
In Paris, a series of massive caps will be brought to the viewer in the shopping streets in their neighbourhood.
If you want to increase your hat collection or fully protect yourself from the sun, you will no longer have to look.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne brought on stage a series of strange super-great roofs during their summer season 2019, which blinded Paris's fashion week.
High and impractical hats are in fashion this summer through Instagram, and these designers have sent their sturdy works to the fashions.
Valentino’s top work covered the heads of the models with an over - offered beige hat decorated with a large edge that resembled the seals.
Among the other very large clothing items were jeweled scarves, magic hats, and even pineapples, but their purpose is not to heat your head.
Thom Browne also showed a strange selection of masks, doing so just in time before Halloween.
Most of the colored masks had sewn mouths, so they looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high.
One part of the work resembled the diving suit with the air pipe and glasses, while the other reminded the melted ice cream.
And if you keep up with the giant mules, you'll be lucky.
The Moegurus predict that the oversized tops can also reach the shopping streets nearby you.
The oversized hats immediately come after La Bomba, a shoulder hat with a width of 60 centimeters, visible in the head of all the fames from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
A cult brand that created a largely impractical hat in social media sent out another major work — a beach bag of straws, almost as large as the bikini model that carries it.
The dark orange raffia bag with raffias and white leathersang was the top piece of Jacquemus La Riviera's summer collection 2019 in Paris's fashion week.
The famous Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing large hats and beach bags in the shopping streets next summer. As the designer has had such an impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for very large clothing.”
John Edward: Language skills are important to world citizens
The Scottish private schools have remained at the top of the academic excellence ranking and continued with the following outstanding exams in 2018, reinforced by personal and collective success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
These schools, where more than 30 000 students are studying all over Scotland and represented by the Scottish Private School Board (SCIS), are trying to provide their students and their parents with the best service.
Private schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen profession and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector capable of designing and implementing a learning programme adapted to the circumstances, we can see that modern languages continue to be known and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “When you speak to a person in a language he can understand, it will come to him.
If you speak to him in his native language, it will come to his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The recent results of this year's exam show that the front of the tables are the languages where the level of pass is highest among private schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages received a high A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that 72 per cent of the students were rated A in Mandarin, 72 per cent of the students in German, 69 per cent of the students in French and 63 per cent of the students in Spanish.
This shows that Scottish private schools support foreign languages as vital skills for life that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
The languages that are now among the choice of subjects are the same in the study programmes of private schools and other schools as STEM subjects (scientific, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A study carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 revealed that, among the reasons for the difficulty for employers in finding workers for vacancies, 17% of respondents had no language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly compulsory to prepare young people for their future work.
Since more desirable job offers require language skills, such skills are becoming essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career choices that have been made, the acquisition of another language will bring a real benefit to a person in the future, as language skills are life-long.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign citizens gives a multilingual person an immediate competitive advantage.
According to YouGovi survey conducted by more than 4000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent of respondents do not speak any foreign language well enough to have a conversation about it. The only language whose percentage was two-digit was 15 percent French.
Therefore, the funding of language education for children today is important.
The knowledge of several languages, especially those of developing economies, gives children better opportunities to find a good job.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in each school.
A number of schools focus on classical modern languages, while other schools teach languages that are considered the most important in the United Kingdom in view of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of the child, private schools always have the opportunity to choose between a number of languages taught by experts in their field.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares and equips children with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future brings them.
It can no longer be denied that languages are essential for the future of the country in a global business environment and must therefore be reflected in education.
It is precisely modern languages that should really be considered as "international communication skills".
Private schools continue to offer young Scots choices, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish private school council.
LeBron makes his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
Exciting admirers no longer have to wait to see LeBron James make his debut at the Los Angeles Laker.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James is playing against Denver Nuggets in the pre-season opening game in San Diego.
But his number of minutes of play still needs to be established.
“This is more than one and less than 48,” said Walton Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell giggling that James is likely to play in a numbered number of minutes.
After last week’s training, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six - game preseason schedule.
“I don’t need preseason games at this stage of my career to warm up,” he said.
Trump Western Virginia election campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will start his election campaign series tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first campaign event scheduled for the next five weeks, including stopping in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While voting for approval until Trump is elected, who will be appointed to the Supreme Court's seat, he will try to increase support for the forthcoming interim elections, as the Republicans will be threatened by the abolition of control in Congress following the vote in November.
What time is Trump's campaign event tonight in West Virginia and how to watch it online?
Trump campaign event in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place on Saturday evening on 29 September 2018 at 19:00 east coast time.
The Trump campaign event in West Virginia can be viewed online via YouTube streaming.
The Trump Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh is probably talking about the meetings of this week's trial, which became tense in connection with the charges of sexual abuse, while the Senate's approval vote has been suspended for a week while the FBI is investigating the case.
However, the main aim of the series of campaign events is to help the Republicans who are facing difficult elections in November.
Thus, the campaign leader of President Trump said that the aim of these five events next week is to "encourage volunteers and supporters when the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority of them in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters communicated.
“The control of the Congress is so important for the President’s agenda that Trump travels into as many states as possible during the election season,” Reuters said Trump’s campaign spokesperson who did not want to mention his name.
Tonight’s campaign event, planned for Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, can bring back supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and also to be reflected in the Pittsburgh media,” reported West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, this is the second time Trump has visited West Virginia in the last month. It is a state where a man received more than 40 percent of the voters' votes in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Western Virginia Republican senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is on the basis of the polls running the charts.
“For Morrisey, this is not a good sign that the President has come to stimulate his results,” said the politicalologist Simon Haeder of the University of West Virginia, Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team gets nervous, keeping their hopes high in front of Sunday’s single games
After three unilateral sessions, the games that took place on Saturday afternoon were sometimes just what Ryder Cup needed.
The fluctuating turning point on the pendulum is a perfectly fictional concept in sport, but players believe in it in real, especially in competitions like this one.
So where do they think there's a turning point now?
“They were led by six points, which have now become four, so I think I can view it as a small turning point,” said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, it is clear, because four points are being led and 12 points are still at stake.
Spieth says the Americans feel that they don't have enough wind in the sails, but they have a lot of encouragement, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each got three points out of four.
Spieth has been foot-to-mouth both in the case of tii and grin and sets an example.
These scabs of butter coming out of the throat became more and more loud in every circle, shattering the determining putt that would have led to the fourth match’s fig stand after he and Thomas were down with two.
His bottle, which won the match on the 15th, sent a similar cry that showed a man's belief that the Americans are not yet out of the race.
“You just have to play more focused and worry about your fight,” Spieth said.
That's all players can do.
Eighteen holes to leave a trail.
The only players who have more points than Spieth and Thomas after the last two days are Ryder Cup's undisputed stars on Francesco Molinar and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe is strange, but the beloved couple are four out of four, and nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't hit bogey on Saturday afternoon, avoiding bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back on nine Friday mornings.
This game and the way in which their energy flows into as loud a crowd as it returns, strengthens the opinion that the players with whom they compete on Sunday, and that when the sun sets over Le Golf National, there is no more famous player than Fleetwood or Molinari to confirm the victory in Europe.
Preferred both simultaneously to different holes.
However, the talk of Europe's glory is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did Sergio Garcia, a four-ball hero this morning, a quick job when a man was banged with Alex Noren.
Bogey and the two doubles in the first nine dug the Spaniard and the Swedes so deep that they had no hope of digging themselves out of it.
But there's no one on Saturday to help you out in August.
Four-balls and even-games are extremely binding to look closely at the interaction between couples, advice given to each other, unsolicited advice and how the way can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken the lead for the last day with a strong lead, but this fourth session has shown that the U.S. team has a nerve to fight in which some Americans in particular have doubts.
Europe is taking the lead on the last day of Ryder Cup 10-6
Europe will have a good lead on the last day of Ryder Cup, leading 10-6 to the United States after Saturday's four-balls and double-games.
The great duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari were led by two difficult-to-do Tiger Woods to raise their current score in Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who contributed two years ago to the preservation of the cup lost in Hazeltine, reigned after failing the American side in the morning in four-balls, winning the 3-1 series.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the match, winning two games, but they could not make up for the deficit.
Jim Furyk's party needs eight points from Sunday's 12 single games to keep the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row. Together with Molinar, who has been called Molliwood since this weekend, they are another couple who have won four points in the history of Ryder Cup in their four opening games.
After destroying the four-ball Woods and Patrick Reed, they continued in the same spirit, defeating Woods and the American beginner, Bryson Dechambeau.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed a random shine, but now lost his 29 four-balls and a pair of games 19, becoming seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who had rested herself in the morning, returned with partner Henrik Stenson to the double game, winning 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who is in the world order first and third.
Europe did not succeed, although the competition was held in a pleasant and windfall south of Paris.
Three-time winners, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, gave the Americans a comparison of two points on Saturday.
They won a solid victory in four-ball 2-1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, returning later and winning Poulter and Rory McIllroyd 4-3 after losing two openings.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup, the team has come back from a four-point deficit when they go to single games, although as owners Furyk's side needs only a tie to keep the cup.
Although being in second place for two days, after Sunday’s counterattack, they seem to be unable to do so.
North Korea says that "in no way" they will not arm themselves unilaterally due to lack of trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the restrictions continued to deepen their distrust over the United States and that the country would not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho, at the annual meeting of the World Organisation, said that in the last year North Korea has taken "remarkable charity measures", such as the suspension of nuclear and missile experiments, the destruction of the nuclear testing site and the promise not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we do not see that the United States has responded," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, our country does not have security, and in such circumstances we do not agree in any way to render ourselves unilaterally the first one."
While Ri repeated the familiar complaints of North Korea regarding Washington's opposition to the "phasing-up" approach to nuclear-weapons, on the basis of which North Korea will be rewarded if it takes a step-by-step approach, it seemed important in his statement that he did not reject unilateral nuclear-weapons, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Uni and Donald Trump on 12 June between the President of the United States and the North Korean leader at the summit in Singapore, when Kim promised to move towards the "decommission of the Korean peninsula" and Trump promised security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has wanted the official end of the Korean war in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax the strict international restrictions on North Korea.
"The U.S. demands "first to give up nuclear weapons" and increases the pressure of restrictions in order to achieve their goal by force, even resisting the declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
“Knowing that restrictions are forcing us on our knees is a dream for people who don’t know us at all.
But the problem is that the limitations continue to deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader in the United Nations stressed earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted the meeting between the three Kims and South Korea leaders of Moon Jae-ini over the last five months and added: "If one of the parties to the nuclear weapon issue were South Korea, not the USA, then the issue of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a deadlock."
However, Ri’s speech was very different from last year when he told the General Assembly of the United Nations that it was inevitable to turn North Korea’s missiles to the US continent after Mr. Bad President Trump called Kim’s suicide mission a “missile man”.
This year, the Trump in the United Nations, which threatened to destroy last year, in the United Nations to Kim, approved his courage to take steps towards non-armour, but added that there is still much to do and that the restrictions must remain in force until North Korea has abandoned its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timetable for this, saying: “Does it take two years, three years or five months — it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should honour the measures taken by Pyongyang.
At the same time, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the enforcement of Security Council restrictions must continue forcefully and without fail until we can fully and definitively confirm the waiver of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased the limits applicable to North Korea by trying to prevent the funding of Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Riga next to the UN General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, although the last trip did not go very well.
After his meeting with the Jew Pyongyang, he said that progress had been made after what North Korea condemned for “gangster-like demands” only a few hours.
This month, North Korea promised to demolish the missiles and nuclear complex at its meeting with Moon if the United States were to implement "similar measures".
He said that Kim had told him that, under the "corresponding measures", he meant the security guarantees allowed in Trump Singapore and the move towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn how to rest enough
This year, Harvard University offers a new course where students need to sleep more to combat the growing aggressive culture where they learn from caffeine rich night-long learning marathons.
Students who love the best academics in the world are often helpless when it comes to basics of self-care.
The designer of this course, the sleep doctor at Harvard Medical School and the expert professor at Brigham and the Women's Hospital, Charles Czeisler, thought it was the first one of his kind in the United States.
He encouraged the creation of a course after he spoke on the topic of how sleep disorders affect learning.
"A girl came to me at the end, and asked me, "Why not now, in my last year of school?"
He said that no one had ever told him the importance of the dream - it made me sick," he explained to Telegraph.
The course, which came into the curriculum for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting results and also help improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, and Director of Health at the University, said that the university decided to take a course on a curriculum after it was found that the students were in serious sleep disorder during the working week.
An hourly course includes a number of counter-active tasks.
The students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books and explain to them the effects of caffeine and light on the impact of lack of sleep on sports results and the importance of the practice of sleeping.
The second part explains how long-term sleeplessness can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
The campus map, along with the counteractive symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily custom.
“We know that this does not change students’ behaviour immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the effects of smoking cigarettes on health," added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, night learning marathons continue to be proud, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students still mean that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
“Promoting a low quality sleep time should be a secret weapon for a student to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety,” he added. “It even helps against weight gain, because lack of sleep makes the brain hungry, making people constantly hungry.”
19-year-old chemical and physical biology student Raymond So, from California, helped Professor Czeisler create a course, having attended one of his classes last year in his first Harvard year.
Raymond said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to contribute to the creation of a university course.
As a next step, he wishes all graduate students to complete a similar study programme before joining a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set the alarm clock to sleep and wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of electronic screens and LED lighting, as this could damage their daily rhythm and cause problems with sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga Gate defeated Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another poor guest game when Dolly Menga's hit, sent by Steven Gerrard, brought 1-0 victory to Livingston.
The Ibrox party hoped to win its first guest victory since February, when 4-1 St Johnstone was defeated, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerrard's second defeat as a leader in 18 games, missing eight points from Ladbrokes Premiership's lead in Hears.
Menga created its gate seven minutes before the duel of the Pole, and the poor readyness of the Rangers couldn't recover from it.
The Rangers will therefore fall to the sixth position, Livingston will rise to the third position, remaining below Hibernian with only one gate.
The problems for the Rangers may not be over, because their attacker Calum Spence needed a head wound after he was probably hit by a discarded object.
Gerrard made eight changes on the side that led to the Ayris and Betfred Cup semifinals.
But Holt went on at the same time as Liv 11 who took a point from Hears last week, and he would have been satisfied with how his well-trained boys suffocated their opponents every step of the way.
The Rangers may have been dominant, but Livingston did a lot more with his ball.
They should have hit the gate in the second opening minutes, when Menga's first shift sent Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's gate, but the half-guard didn't take advantage of his chance.
The deep spring of Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow was only able to make a wide-ranging arc in the rear post.
The Rangers did have control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in the last third of their game.
Alfredo Morelos felt confident that he should have been punished when he collided with Steven Lawless on the 15th minute of the game, Judge Steven Thomson was not satisfied with the Colombian player's complaint.
In the first half of the time, Rangers managed to make only two hits to the target, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not worried about either Lassana Coulibaly's forehead or Ovie Ejaria's event.
Although Liv’s 34th minute opening might have broken the rules of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it purely for their performances.
Once again, the Rangers couldn't control Jacobs' deeply difficult performance.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher hit Scott Robinson, who kept the peace and selected Menga, who just finished the plan.
Gerrard was on break, switching from Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, and this exchange almost paid off when the extremism split Morelos, but impressive Kelly pushed him to stop him.
But Livingston continued to attract guests to play exactly the type of game that suits them where Lithgow and Halkett picked up long balls.
The Holt side could have promoted its leadership at the end, but McGregor stood firm, preventing Jacobs before Lithgow from a large corner.
The Rangers replacement, Glenn Middleton, once again applied for a punishment when he was in trouble with Jacobs, which Thomson again failed to satisfy.
Almanahh: Geiger counter inventor
And now our Sunday Morning from Almanahhi: 30 September 1882, today 136 years ago and LONDADES ... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a invention that eventually led to a device known as Geiger counter.
From this foundation of science, Geiger’s counter also became the foundation of pop culture, as in the 1950 film “Coronado Watches”, in which these seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans were:
Man: "What's that about?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When wearing these earphones, you can hear the nucleus of atoms separated from the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: "Don't tell me, it's still bouncing!"
“Hans” Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name will live on.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system “see” Fraud cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system "see" fraud cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to feel as part of the treatment of fraud cells
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing the laboratory of these cells
Then they are able to share a common protein for many cancers and are injected back into the body.
The study vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system how to identify the transmutor cells disappeared from her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient. These cells are changed in the laboratory to obtain a ‘visa’ protein that is common in various HER2 cancers and then injected back into the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesdas Maryland explained: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 is responsible for the growth of many types of cancer, including breast, ovary, lung and colorectal cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach in which immune cells are taken from patients and taught to target cancer cells has been used to treat certain types of leukaemia.

After his third song, which was named Ghost Town and where he was wearing a hat in a letter from Make America Great, he began to play a bunch of democracies and repeated his support for Trump.
"I have spoken so much to white people who ask me, "How can you like Trump, he is a race?"
“If I were so concerned about racism, I would have moved away from America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL began the arrangement with Matt Damon, where Hollywood fame made a joke about Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judges Committee regarding alleged sexual violence by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although this part of the show didn't go on the air, West was loaded into Chris Rock's social media.
It's not clear if Rock tried to mock West's post.
He also complained to the audience that he was having a hard time with his hat behind the scenes.
“They made fun of me behind the stage.
They said I wouldn't go in there with a hat in my head.
They made fun of me!
And then they say I'm drowned in the place," he said according to the Washington Anaminer.
West continued: “You want to see a drowned place? I put on my Superman’s cape, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try it with love."
According to Variety, one person said: “All the studio remained dead quiet.”
The West was presented at the last moment to replace Ariana Grande because the singer's former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, was dead a few days earlier.
The West surprised many with the song “I Love It,” when he performed it, he looked like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who screamed: “To one brave soul: THIS IS WHAT WE DO, THAT YOU DOES NOT HAPPEN TO THE UNION.”
But the showman Karen Hunter giggling that West was just "the one that he is, and it's absolutely wonderful."
“But I decided not to reward (by buying my music or clothing or by supporting his “art”) someone who believes and spreads a harmful world view to my community.
He's free.
Like us," he added.
Before the show, rapper on Twitter announced that he's changed his name, saying he's now "former Kanye West."
He's not the first singer to change his name, following Diddy, who's also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also rapper Snoop Dog has been named Snoop Lion and, of course, a recent music legend Prince, who changed his name into a symbol.
Murder charge related to the stabilization of the Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
It is expected that the defendant will appear before the Belfast magistrate court on Monday.
The prosecution will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The fame of the Troon game Kit Harington does not approve the frame of masculine
Kit Harington is well-known for the flashing role of his sword in Jon Snowina HBO's violent medieval fantasy game of the Troons.
However, an actor (31) drops down an aggressive hero's stereotype, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit thought that "some things have gone wrong" and raised the question of how to solve a fine masculine problem in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie (31) in his Troon game, admitted that he felt "very strongly" that this problem needed attention.
“I personally feel quite strongly now that we have gone wrong somewhere with masculine,” he said.
"What have we taught men when they grow up about the problem that we now see?"
Kit believes that TV is partly responsible for the increase in masculinity, because it shows some of the masculine characters.
He continued: “What is born, and what is taught?
What they teach on TV and on the streets gives young boys the feeling that they must be just like men.
I think it's really one of the bigger questions of our time - how to change it?
Because obviously something has gone wrong for young men."
In the survey, he also admitted that after the end of the series next summer he would never participate in any of the Troon's games, saying that he was "on the one hand with his own fields and horses".
Since November, Kit Sam Shepard participates in the revitalization of True West, which tells the story of the filmmaker and his kidnapper brother.
The actor recently announced that he considered meeting his wife Rose the best thing about the Troon game.
“I met my wife in this series, so it gave me my future family and my future life,” she said.
Rose played Ygritte, the Kit character, Jon Snow, in an award-winning fantasy series with Emmy.
A couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has risen by 14%.
According to healthcare professionals, more than 820,000 suffer from this disease.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases have come from sex, changing the past.
In some parts of China , HIV was spread by blood transfusions .
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had decreased to almost zero, the Chinese health officials confirmed at the conference in Yunnan Province.
Over the years, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100 000.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but the distinction between LGBT people is allegedly high.
Research shows that 70-90% of men having sex with men eventually marry women.
Many transfers of diseases are linked to insufficient sexual protection of such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has allowed general access to HIV medicines to be used to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking the employee's GOP Senator's data, saying it's dangerous lies and conspiracy theories.
On Saturday, the US representative Maxine Waters condemned the claims that his employee had posted the personal data of three Republican US Senators on the Wikipedia pages.
Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that such claims are spread by "ultra-better" trolls and their websites.
“Values, lies and even more despicable lies,” said Waters in his Twitter statement.
The published information allegedly contained the home addresses and telephone numbers of the US Senators Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch (both Utahs).
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday. It was posted by an unknown person at the Captain Hill during the hearing of the Senate Panel in connection with claims of sexual misconduct against the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
Information was leaked shortly after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Old-fashioned websites such as Gateway Pund and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was linked to the Waters office and issued member information from the Waters employee reported by Hill.
“This unjustified claim is a complete and absolute lie,” Waters continued.
"My staff, whose identity, personal data and safety are at risk because of their fraudulent and false claims, are not liable in any way for this leak of information.
This unjustified claim is a complete and irrefutable lie."
Waters’ statement was quickly reviewed on the Internet, including one of the reviewers of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is due to anger,” wrote Fleischer.
“This indicates that he has a way of feeling that is not appropriate to a member of the Congress.
If someone is accused of something they haven't done, they can't get angry.
They mustn't be troubling.
They must not question the prosecutor's motives.
They must remain calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
The Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is running for Waters in interim elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“While it was the truth,” he shrieked.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities about their fraudulent claims.”
"We do all we can to find out the criminals," he continued, "and to place them legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous for all my employees."
Film Johnny English Strikes Again Review - underenhanced Rowan Atkinson spy parodiate
It is now common practice to search for the meanings of Brexit in all the new British films, and this seems to be particularly appropriate for the resurgence of Johnny English Reborn in 2003.
Is it humorous to joke about ourselves, how clearly foolish we are in the new country's export opportunity?
In any case, Johnny English, who is incompetent with a thick-eyed rubber face, has received permission to do things once again in his own hand - and that this broad comical creation is intended for non-English-speaking film territories.
Of course, it's a secret agent who, despite his strange pretentious stemuli glamour, looks a little like Clouseau, a little bit like Mr Bean and a little bit of the character who gave the Chariots of Fire to the Chariots of the 2012 opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London.
It is also based on the passenger and international mysterious Atkinson who was once played in forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, leaving nothing but chaos behind.
This last JE film has only one or two pleasant moments.
I liked Johnny English's approach to the helicopter when he was wearing a medieval iron suit and his helicopter wings used to wear his helmet for a while.
Atkinson's gift is shown to be a physical comedy, but humor seems to be less important and strangely excessive, especially when "serious" spy films such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves offer a comedy.
It seems that this humor is more intended for children than adults, and for me Johnny English's clever adventures are not as ingenious and focused as Atkinson's dark movies Beanina.
For the time being, there is a real assumption that Britain is in serious trouble.
The cyber hacker has penetrated the British network of top secret spies, revealing the personalities of all British secret police officers, thereby disappointing the local agent - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, who is a festive and troubled character who suffers from the burden of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing this Teresa-May character perfectly, but the manuscript does not have much to do to work on.
His intelligence counselors suggest that as all active spies are threatened, he must call back someone who has retired.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a schoolmaster in a fancy institution, giving secret lessons on how to be a secret agent: here are a couple of good places where English offers the School of Rock-type spy school.
English will be returned to Whitehall for an emergency notification and reunited with his former long-term partner Bough, who will be played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the captain of the submarine, where actress Vicki Pepperdine's talents have been seriously wasted.
So Batman and Robin, the disgraces of His Majesty's secret service are back in action, meeting Olga Kurélenko's incarcerated beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is putting himself under dangerously charismatic technology billionaires, and he claims he can solve all the computer problems in Britain: poor Jason Volta, who is being played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start with their Jantile Odyssey: hiding themselves as waitresses, they put fire on the French restaurant; they create chaos, secretly restraining Volta's luxury hunt; and English launches a genuine mess when it tries to use the main set of virtual reality to get to know the interior of the Volta house.
No brakes are used in this last section, but as cute and as stormy as it is, the whole thing has to do with children's TV maik.
That's a bit of middle-class stuff.
And as with other Johnny English films, I found myself thinking: does the British film industry really not have a role to play that is fair to his talent?
The working party denies drawing up a plan where the British work for four days a week, but they are paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party has considered a radical plan that provides for the British to work four days a week, but they're paid five days ago.
The party wants the company's superiors to pass on savings from the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to workers, giving them an additional day off.
That's how employees would have a three-day weekend - but they'd get the same pay.
According to the source, this idea would fit in with the Party's economic agenda and so the country will be tilted to the benefit of the workers.
The Thursday working week has been approved by the Trade Union Congress so that workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
The source of the working party said to The Sunday Times: “It is said that the review of the Bill will be announced before the end of the year.
“This is not happening overnight, but Thursday’s work week is an attempt that is compatible with the party’s approach to balance the economy both for the benefit of workers and with the overall industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party is not the first to support such ideas, as during its 2017 election campaign the Green Party also promised Thursday working week.
However, the effort is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
The Labour force press representative stated: “The four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not discussed.”
Asec. John McDonnell used the Labour Party Conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist turnout in the economy.
McDonald said that he had decided to take back the power of the public utility companies from "seen managers" and "benefit-servicers".
The plans of the Asekantsler also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not be able to regain their entire share, as the Labour Party could do "deductions" in connection with perceived misdemeanor.
He confirmed his plan to put employees in company management and to create inclusive equity funds to provide 10% of private companies' equity to employees, instead of providing annual bonuses up to EUR 561,65.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are on the show "60 Minutes" to see if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their mind.
The investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh by the FBI has delayed the final vote on the application to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question as to whether the Office's conclusions could affect the suspension of the support of Republican senators.
In the Sunday poll, you will be asked by Scott Pelley, co-sponsor of the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, whether the FBI could reveal anything that might change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
“I said I'm going to the interrogation. I said I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges came out and asked him, "Did you do this?"
He was decisive, certain and unambiguous."
Graham's voice seems to be bald.
"I am sure of my decision on Brett Kavanaugh and it could only be changed in the bombshell," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know how it happened, but I know Brett denied it forcefully," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he has named could not confirm it.
It's a 36-year-old thing.
I don't see anything new coming."
What is the global Citizens' Festival Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, the annual music event will be held at the New York Global Citizen Festival, which has a hugely impressive participation in celebrities and an equally impressive goal: to eliminate poverty from the world.
Now, tens of thousands of people in the Central Park's Great Lawn are being held for the seventh time, not only enjoying singers like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raising awareness of the real goal of the event, namely ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project to the global poverty project. It is an international group of lawyers hoping to end poverty by constantly increasing the number of people who are fighting it.
To receive a free ticket (unless you wish to pay for a VIP ticket), concert guests had to perform a number of tasks or voluntary activities, send e-mails to some world leader, call or do something else important to help raise awareness of their goal of poverty eradication.
But how successful has Global Citizen been if there is another 12 years to achieve these goals?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert is a real way to convince them to demand action or is it just another click-off where people feel that they are doing something important by signing an application online or giggling?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million "activities" for its supporters, seeking to achieve a number of different objectives.
According to this, these measures have helped world leaders to inform more than 37 billion dollars of commitments and policies that affect more than 2.25 billion lives by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group referred to 390 commitments and notifications resulting from their activities, of which at least USD 10 billion has already been paid out or financed.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on around 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include the UK-based partnership between investors and implementing companies in the Power of Nutrition, which is committed to "help children to exploit all their abilities", giving Rwanda 35 million dollars to help to end malnutrition after having received more than 4700 sparks from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK Government, donors, national governments and global citizens, such as you, we can turn malnutrition into a historical footnote for social injustice,” said the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition to the crowd of Tracey Ullman during the London concert in April 2018.
The Group also informed that, following more than 5000 actions in the United Kingdom that called for better mothers and children’s nutrition, the government announced a financing project called The Power of Nutrition, reaching 5 million women and children in need of nutrition intervention.
In response to one FAQ on its website, which asks, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: “It’s a long and difficult road — sometimes we fall and fail.
However, like the great civil rights and anti-parthide movements facing us, we are convinced of our success, because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Weekly, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are just a couple of performers who will perform this year's event in New York, run by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use a Navy "block" to prevent Russia's energy exports - Minister for the Interior
According to the Washington Anaminer, Washington may, if necessary, use its own Navy to avoid hitting the Russian energy market, including in the Middle East, has been published by U.S. Home Minister Ryan Zinke.
Zinke claimed that Russia's participation in Syria, in particular if it acted on the call of a legitimate government, is a pretext for the investigation of new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to channel energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, on the South European market," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to solve it.
"The United States of America has this opportunity, with the help of our Navy, to ensure that the maritime routes are open and, if necessary, blocked, in order to ensure that their energy does not enter the market," it added.
Zinke’s statement was turned over to the participants in the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit organisation that represents the US energy consumer’s voice.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, stating that they were essentially the same.
"The economic choice between Iran and Russia is more or less, strengthening and replacing fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one-tip pony" whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump Government is responsible for increasing the export of LNG to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to reject the "uncompliant" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into "the prisoner" in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's acute opposition to the project has simply been motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of putting pressure on the market and that consumers should have the option of choosing suppliers," said Alexander Novak, Russian Minister of Energy, at a meeting in Moscow in September with U.S. Minister of Energy Rick Perry.
The US attitude has been set back by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI) called on the US to refrain from EU energy policy and from the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a major problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, President of the German Industry Association (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering running for president in 2020, says the Massachusetts Senator
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that he was seriously considering running for president in interim elections.
In the Holyoke Town Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed the consideration of his application.
“It is time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and this includes the first lady,” he said, said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I seriously consider running for president."
Warren also assessed the activities of President Donald Trump at the Town Hall, saying that he “is leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I am seriously concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has published a criticism of Trump and this Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
Friday's sparkle Warren: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, the poll published on Thursday showed that most Warren's own voters do not think that they should be running in 2020.
According to the study by the University of Suffolk, the political research centre/Bobe, 58% of the “probable” voters in Massachusetts believed that the senator should not run.
32% supported such an application.
The survey showed more support for the candidate for former Governor Dev Patrick, 38% supported the potential candidate and 48% opposed it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in connection with a possible 2020 application include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd officially decide by January, Associated Press announced.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palini PTSD at Donald Trump's gathering
Track Palin (26) spent the year recruiting Iraq in September.
He was arrested on Monday night in connection with a domestic violence case and charged with assault.
“What my son is going through, what he experiences when he comes back, I can associate myself with other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers are returning to,” he told the audience at Donald Trump’s gathering in Tulsa Oktaham.
Palin called for his son to be arrested “in the evangelical space” and said regarding his son and other war veterans, “they come back a little differently, they come back in the karates, they come back wondering if there is enough respect for what soldiers and airmen and all other soldiers have given to the state.”
According to Dan Bennett, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska on Monday, and was accused of domestic violence against women, of interference in domestic violence and the possession of a gun in a drunk state.
18 states and the Columbia region contesting the new asylum policy
Eighteen countries and the Columbia region support the legal challenge of a new US policy banning asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives of 18 countries and regions submitted a brief statement by court friends in Washington to support the challenging policy of the asylum seeker, announced NBC News.
The full name of the applicant, Grace v Sessions, was not published by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the Allied Policy.
She said that her partner, “and her violent gang members’ sons,” abused her, but U.S. officials did not accept her application for asylum on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
National lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries producing a large number of US asylum seekers with a major problem of gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has reversed the decision of the Immigrant Board of Appeal in 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee from domestic violence to submit asylum applications.
Karl Racine, District Attorney General of Colombia, said in a statement on Friday that a new policy “infrings for decades national, Union and international law”.
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be resolved in accordance with certain facts and circumstances of the application, and such a claim violates this principle," stood in a brief statement by friends of the Court.
In a brief statement, the lawyers also claimed that the ban on the entry of immigrants would damage the US economy by saying that they would probably become entrepreneurs and that they would provide the necessary labour force.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges no longer to give asylum to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence.
“The application for asylum is available to those who leave home country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or a certain social group or political opinion,” said Sessions in their communication of 11 June.
The purpose of the asylum was never to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day.
Entertainmental rescue operations in prayer, where deaths have doubled in the struggle to find survivors
The situation was increasingly threatening for the survivors.
“The situation is very tense,” said 35-year-old Mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her fever in the evacuation center of Palu, a little boy.
“Every minute, new people arrive with an ambulance.
There's not enough clean water."
The inhabitants returned to their destroyed homes, sorting outaked things and trying to save everything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals affected by a 7.5-magnetic earthquake were overloaded.
Some injured, including Dwi Haris on the back and upper arm rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients continued to be treated under outside conditions for strong follow-up.
Tears filled his eyes when he recalled how a strong earthquake shook his fifth - floor hotel room, which he shared with his husband and daughter.
“There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was pushed against the wall in the ruins," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my kid.
I hope they're not in danger."
The U.S. Ambassador blames China for "smokering with ads"
A week after the Chinese official newspaper published four-page advertising under the US daily news on the mutual benefit of trade between the USA and China, the US Ambassador accused Beijing, China, of using American press to disseminate propaganda.
Last Wednesday, the US President Donald Trump referred to an annex paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's largest thiraaise newspaper - after China was accused of interference in the US Congress elections on 6 November, which China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to intervene in the US elections marked what U.S. officials described to Reuters as a new stage in the Washington expansion campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war where import tariffs are adjusted.
The Chinese countermeasures at the beginning of the tariff war were designed to catch exporters of states such as Iowa, as they supported the parties of the Trump Republics, the Chinese and US experts have explained.
The US Ambassador in China and former Iowa Governor, as well as China's largest agricultural exporter Terry Branstad, said that Beijing damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in the opinion article of the Des Moines Register on Sunday: “China has now doubled its temptation by publishing rushing advertisements in our free press.”
“The Chinese Government is using the precious freedom of expression and free press practice to disseminate its propaganda by putting its paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” wrote Branstad.
"On the other hand, there are only limited votes in Beijing Street, and there are no truly different views that the Chinese people may have on the worrying economic direction of China, given that the media is firmly at the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he added.
He added that one of the most outstanding newspapers in China refused to publish his article, but he did not say which newspaper was involved.
Analysts warn that the Republicans are alienating women before the mid-term elections with Kavanaugh fiasco
While many Republicans are waiting and defending Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court, who has been accused of several sexual attacks, analysts have warned that they will see a setback during the forthcoming interim elections, especially from women.
The feelings surrounding the situation have been in check, and most Republicans have already shown that they want to go ahead with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn," said Grant Reeher, professor of political sciences at the Maxwell School at the University of Siracus, in his article published on Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute effort to investigate the FBI was sufficient to calm the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow or November,” said Friday’s senior advisor to the Progressive Group MoveOn and national representative Karine Jean-Pierre Washington DC newspaper.
On Friday morning, the protesters repeated their demonstrations in the Senate corridor, because the Republicans who control the judges’ committees decided to move forward with the Kavanaugh nomination, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, announced Mic.
"Democratic Ind and Internal Relief are beginning to fall outside the schedule," said the informal political analyst Stu Rothenberg.
“People say it's already high, it's true.
But it may be higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters aged 18-29, who often do not like and abstain from voting."
Even before Ford's public statement describing his allegations of sexual assault on the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts predicted a setback when the Republicans moved forward with confirmation.
“It has become very confusing for GOP,” said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the National Committee of the Republicans, NBC News, at the beginning of last week.
"This concerns not only the Commission's vote, the final vote, or whether Plannaugh will be appointed, but also how the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have treated it," highlighted Mr.
However, the Americans seem to be slightly divided, who believe in Ford and who in Kavanaugh, but with a little more support for the first.
The new YouGovi survey showed that 41% of respondents certainly or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35% said that they certainly or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said that they thought Kavanaugh was probably or certainly lying at the time of his testimony, while only 30% thought the same thing about Ford.
Thanks to Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations and at least one of the other charges against Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified to the Senate Judges Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed him his genitals when they attended a party during their studies in Yale in 1980.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to start a new internet that will put Google and Facebook in the chest.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launched a start-up company that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology agent Inrupt is a company that builds up Berners-Lee open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have been given access to the information.
In an exceptional interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee made fun of the fact that Inrupt's goal was "the rule of the world".
"We have to do this now," he said about the start-up company.
"This is an historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their "personal online data collection" or POS.
It may include contact lists, task lists, calendar, music collection and other personal and competent tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all available in one browser and at the same time.
Its personal online data collection makes it unique for the user to choose who can access this information.
The company refers to it as "the granting of personal powers through data".
According to the CEO of the company John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is that the company should bring sources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid make it available to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project under contract, and a community of voluntary coders.
Since that week, technology developers worldwide can create their decentralised applications using the resources available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team will not talk to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change when all their business models are fully supported overnight.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a post published in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt aims to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid."
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an effective voice in the network's neutrality debate.
Even when Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee World Wide Web Consortia, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute will remain the founder and director.
“I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The spiritual monument of Victoria, who was crucified in World War I, was opened
In World War I alone, the Church of England, baptized by Victoria, celebrated the 100th anniversary of its hometown.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann fought his honor out on September 29, 1918 at the attack on Belleglise and Lehaucourt.
But he died four days later with a sniper bullet and he didn't know he had the highest honor of the British army.
His two grandsons opened a memorial stone on Saturday in Northamptonshire, Rushden.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it would be “genibly symbolic” if the stone was opened exactly 100 years after the grandfather’s prized struggle.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Vann led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog of japs and a machine-gunner's ammunition."
Later, he rushed to the line of attack and carried it on with “the greatest galaxy” before he alone rushed to one gun and made three opponents unconscious.
Lieutenant Vanni killed a German sniper on October 4, 1918, when the end of the war was only a little more than a month.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather’s actions were “nothing I know I can never repeat, but for which I am always grateful.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, placed a monkey after a parade led by Brentwood's gang of young people.
Michael Vann said that he has “a great honour to participate in this parade” and added that“the presence and support of so many people shows that a true hero can be appreciated.”
MMA fans were Bellator 206 to look up all night, but you only saw Peppa in Pigs.
Imagine you've been up all night looking at Bellator 206, but you're not even gonna be able to see this main event.
The San Jose match included 13 fights, including six key maps, and was shown in the UK on channel 5 live throughout the night.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousas and Rory MacDonald prepared to breast-feed each other, the UK viewers lost their mouths because the Põssä Peppa appeared on the screen.
Many were not impressed by it, especially those who had remained awake until early hours to see this struggle.
A fan described on Twitter the transition to a children's comic book as "a joke that hurts".
“This is the government’s regulation that the content was no longer appropriate at 6 a.m. and they had to switch to the children’s program,” explained Dave Schwartz, the Senior Vice-President of Bellator on marketing and communication issues when asked about the transfer.
"Peep Peppa," yes."
Bellator President Scott Coker said that they were going to work on their timetables in order to take more account of the UK viewers in the future.
"If I think about the re-enactment now, I think we can solve this problem in the future," Coker said.
“But if it is 6 a.m. Sunday morning there, we cannot do it until our own Sunday, which is their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was modified, there were many back and forth texts and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical malfunction.
But it wasn't, it was a government rule.
I can promise you this will not happen next time.
We're going to show you a reference instead of six fights, as we usually do, and we're trying to offer more fans, and we just went over in time.
It's the exact situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "low value" in connection with sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old young man said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "everyone is like him".
By participating in Lauren Laverne Radio 4 on Desert Island Discs, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others hope.
Having a parent also changed his attitude toward winning the Olympic Games, giving him the feeling that it was no longer so important.
You will be a regular long-term escort Kirsty Young had to take a few months off due to his illness.
In Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt less valuable growing up than others, because it wasn't socially acceptable when you liked boys and girls.
He said: “Until today, these feelings are that I am not worthy and feel different, gave me power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was worthy of anything, and he didn't disappoint others when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The winner of the Double Bronze Olympics has become the leader of a highly valued LGBT campaign, using his appearance in the Nations Games of this year in Australia to turn to more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said he was talking about it because he was lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wants to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - American film artist Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "contributed him as a surprise."
Daley married a 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said that the difference between age and age has never been a problem.
"If you were so young" - he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - then it was hard to find someone the same old who had experienced similar rises and fits.
The couple became parents in June, having a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his whole outlook had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning the gold medal," he said.
“But you know, there are much more important things than the gold medals in the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son got his name after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age, after he was diagnosed as a brain tumour.
Daley said that his father didn't agree to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets to London in 2012, because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him that "Dad, you can't sit in the front row because by then you're gone," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he had actually finished his breath and died, I finally admitted that he was not undefeated," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the Bronze.
"I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of the home crowd at the Olympic Games, that there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first selection of songs, Heather Small's Proud, which helped him prepare the Olympic Games and still gives him chicken skin.

Out of the format, Mickelson was removed from the game on Saturday at Ryder Cup.
The American Phil Mickelson will make a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he must improve his form to avoid unfortunate milestones.
Mickelson, who plays record 12 times every two years at the event, was removed from the game by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's doubles and four-balls.
Instead of being at the centre of action, as it has often been for the United States, the five-time winner divided his day into two, being an inspiration and working on his game, hoping to improve it.
Never the most direct hiter, not even at the top of his career, is suitable for a 48-year-old especially to play in a narrow Le Golf National Golf Course, where a long hard track punishes a constantly misguided blow.
And if the field itself is not scary enough, Mickelson will be standing on Sunday, at his ninth competition, facing the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinar, who has joined forces with the beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his competitions this week.
If Americans who are behind four points at the beginning of the 12 single games start with a fiery start, the Mickelson competition may be extremely important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, but he didn't have much else to add.
"He fully understood his part of today, patted me on the shoulder, put his hand around my shoulder, and said that he would be ready by tomorrow," Furyk added.
“He is very confident.
He's a celebrity and he's given so much to our teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't see him play two games.
I saw more than that, but that's how it went, and we had to choose this way.
He wants to be out like everyone else."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record on Sunday as the most participating player in Ryder Cup games.
This may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which has never responded to his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said that his presence has provided the team with an additional spiritual contribution.
"He's funny, funny, funny, he likes to have fun with people, and he's just great in the team room," he explained.
“I think that younger players had a lot of fun this week when they went against him, and it was nice to see him.
He's offering a lot more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great country of progress will soon be lost
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows from his experience that Ryder Cup's last day's great leadership at the beginning of individual games can easily become an unpleasant experience.
The Dane stood before the public at the 1997 contest in Valderram, where, together with Captain Seve Ballesteros, five-point progress was held in front of the Americans, but when it reached the finish line, it had fallen dramatically, only won 141⁄2 : 131⁄2.
“You will even remember that we had a great lead in Valderram; we also had great success in Brookline, where we lost and in Valderram, where we won, this victory came very little,” said Bjorn, in the picture after the Class of 2018 victory 5 : 3 Fridays and yesterday’s success 10 : 6 Le Golf Nationals.
So history shows me and the whole team that it can happen again.
You're going to do your best tomorrow.
You're going out and doing the right thing.
It's not over until you have points in it.
We have a goal that is to win the cup, and so let's focus on it.
I've been saying all along, I'm focusing on 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of who our opponents are - the best players in the world."
Being satisfied with how his players played on this difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I’m not going to rush ahead with things.
Tomorrow we're dealing with completely new obstacles.
Tomorrow, personal performances will read, and so it's something else.
It's nice to be with the opponent when things go well, but if you're there personally, you'll be tested to the fullest extent as a golfer.
It's the message you have to pass on to the players tomorrow, give them the best of you.
Now that you're leaving your partner, he's got to go, he's got to get along."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk hopes that his players will work better in person than with the opponents, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who received three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced both in these last days, being part of Brookline's victory team before becoming part of the defeat, when Europe defeated Medinah's miracle.
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to the question of how Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 encouraged his players to put all his game on the last day.
“We will have 12 important games tomorrow, but you will have to start hot, like at Brookline and like Medinahi.
If the speed goes in one direction, it will put great pressure on the average competitions.
Let's set up our team accordingly and put the boys on the field in a way that we feel that tomorrow will be a miracle."
Thomas is assigned to try to run the competition and he's against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahmi, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the best Europeans in the competition.
“I put my boys in this order because I think we are properly covered,” Bjorn said of his choice of single games.
Germany’s new warship continued to delay
The German Navy's latest high-speed sailboat should have come into operation in 2014, replacing the old Cold War war war ships, but this will not happen before the next year due to defective systems and increased costs as a snowball, the local media reported.
The launch of the new Baden-Wuerttmberg class high-speed sailboat ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 in accordance with the military press release published in Die Zeit.
The ship should have joined the Navy already in 2014, but the worrying post-transmission problems did not make the fate of this ambitious project easy.
Four of the Baden-Wuerttberg's class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aged Bremen class with high-speed sailboats.
It is understandable that they have a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some concealment technologies such as radar, infrared and hearing signals.
Other important options include longer maintenance periods - the latest high-speed sails should be able to leave the port for up to two years.
However, persistent delays mean that top-level warships - which allow Germany to strengthen power abroad - are getting old by the time they enter the service.
A failed F125 high-speed sailboat appeared in the news last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Hamburg Blohm & Voss shipyard.
This was the first time the Navy has sent the ship back to the builder since it was received.
The reasons for the return were little known, but the German media quoted a number of important "software and hardware gaps" that made the warship unusable if used on the battle mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important since Baden-Württemberg class ships are operated by a team of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of the old Bremen class.
It was also found that the ship is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to incorporate future innovations.
The 7,000-ton ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ is probably twice as heavy as the class ships the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price of the entire project, including the training of the team, becomes a problem.
It has been said that it will amount to EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - compared to the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest high-speed sails become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German Navy will be reduced.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Chairman of the Committee on Defence of the German Parliament, acknowledged that the Navy has in fact "has run out of eligible vessels".
The official said that this subject had grown over time as a snowball because old ships were removed, but no replacement ships came.
He regretted that none of the high-speed sailboats in Baden-Wuerttmember could join the Navy.
National Trust is investigating the secret life of bats.
The purpose of the new study in the Scottish mountainous region is to reveal how bats use the landscape to find their own food.
It is hoped that the results will provide new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future protection measures.
The study of Scottish National Trust researchers follows the usual and sopra peppers in the Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross, as well as the brunts of long ears and Daubenton bats.
Special recording agents are placed in the main locations of the area to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers shall also conduct field studies using hand-holding sensors.
The competent assessment of all recordings shall determine the frequency and species of bat call.
A habitat map and a report will then be created to create a detailed landscape view of their behaviour.
The NTS Nature Councillor Rob Dewar hopes that the results will show which habitats are the most important for bats and how different species use them.
This information will help to determine the usefulness of the management of habitats, such as the creation of meadows and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other associated species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom as a whole, the mortality rate of bats has decreased considerably in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect their habitats and their loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, such as flying papers and chemical treatment of certain building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
But their night hunting makes their ears more useful in catching prey than their eyes.
They use complex echo location techniques to identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
More than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land maintenance in the whole country are very serious for bats.
They have ten trained experts who regularly conduct studies, surveys, and sometimes save.
The organisation has even created the first and only special bat reserve in Threave, Scotland, in Dumfrie and Galloway, where eight of the ten bat types in Scotland live.
Real estate manager David Thompson says this area is the perfect territory for them.
"We have a large area for bats in Three," he said.
“We have old buildings, many old trees and a great place to live.
But there is still much to discover about bats, so the work we do here and in other areas will help us understand better what they need."
It stresses the importance of checking bats before starting care activities on the property, as the unwanted destruction of a single place of pregnancy and childbirth can kill up to 400 women and young people, and even destroy the entire local population.
bats are protected, and killing, disturbing or destroying them is illegal.
The Scottish officer, Elisabeth Ferrell, has been encouraging the public to contribute.
He said: “We still have so much to learn about our bats, and we just don’t know many of our species and how their deaths feed.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges, while lawyers plan to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has rejected the charges of rape against him as a "venture news", saying that people want to advertise themselves, using his name.
His lawyers intend to bring charges against the defendant of the German newspaper Der Spiegel.
The attackers of Portugal and Juventus have been accused of the rape of American woman Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He has allegedly paid the women EUR 330 643,10 not to speak about the incident, announced by Der Spiegel on Friday.
When turning to Instagram directly to their 142 million followers for hours after charges, Ronaldo (33) reported that it was "the news of debt".
"No, no, no, no.
What we said today is in the false news," said five times to the winner of the Ballon d'Or.
They want to advertise by my name.
It's common.
They want to be famous by my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to refer Der Spiegel to the Court for "unauthorized disclosure of suspicion of privacy".
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player is seeking compensation for “a moral injury corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged case occurred in a suite in the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
After a night club meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the hotel room of the player, where he was allegedly raped, according to the Clark County District Court, on the basis of the documents submitted in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was a “99 percent good man” of whom one percent failed.
The papers say Ronaldo confirmed a couple of sexual relations, but it was not unanimous.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photographs of injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court solution because she was afraid of a "hand tax" and was concerned about "public humiliation".
Now a 34-year-old woman says that she is now trying to override the solution, as the alleged case continues to trauma her.
Ronaldo had left Manchester United and joined Real Madrid during the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italy for a transaction of EUR 100 million in giant Juve.
Brexit: The United Nations can begin to regret car manufacturers leaving forever
The United Kingdom would “during it forever” if it lost its position as head of the world’s automotive industry after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that the U.S.G. had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily suspend their production at the plant near Derby in Burnaston.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of border crossings without Brexit’s agreement could be paid for jobs.
The Burnastonian plant, which manufactures vehicles in the Ayeota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that, when Britain starts leaving the EU at the end of March, we will see a stop in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Burnastoni Tokyo.
Other UK car manufacturers have also feared to leave the EU without an agreement, worrying about the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will shut down the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to supply chain risks in the absence of a Brexit agreement.
The Tokyo production line operates as required, where spare parts arrive from both the United Kingdom and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement of 29 March, there may be disruptions at the border which, according to industry, may result in delays and a shortage of parts.
Tokyo would not be able to keep supplies for more than one day at its Derbyshire plant, which is why production has to be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May Chequers' plan for future EU relations is "accuracy calibrated to avoid such border controls."
“We need an agreement. We want the best solution to enable what we want, and not only to make use of the current success, but also to make use of the opportunity,” he said to the BBC Radio 4 show Today.
"Certains not only from Tokyo but also from other producers show that we must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
In the long term, it was not possible to say how long production would be stopped, but in the long term, it warned that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually pay for jobs.
Peter Tsouvalari, a 24 - year - worked union in Burnaston, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “We know from our own experience that when jobs disappear, they will not return.
The government spokesperson said: "We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says the White House
The large-scale meeting of Donald Trump with Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be postponed for another week, as the fight against the highest-ranking candidate Brett Kavanaugh is continuing, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein is monitoring the work of Special Commissioner Robert Mueller, who is investigating the intervention of Russian elections, the links between Trump's assistants and Russia, and the prevention of possible justice by the President.
Whether Trump fires the D.A.'s deputy and thus threatens Mueller's independence has been firing rumors in Washington for several months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times announced that Rosenstein was discussing the use of wiretaps to record conversations with Trump and the possibility to remove the President through Amendment 25.
Rosenstein didn't confirm that.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, reporting that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he didn't want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a coincidence with the hearing of the Senate Committee of Judges, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both gave a lesson.
On Friday Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, postponing the Senate vote.
Trump's spokesperson Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday in Fox News.
When asked about Rosenstein’s meeting: “This date has not yet been set, it may be this week, but it may be delayed for another week, taking into account all the matters involved in the Supreme Court.
But let's take a look at this, and I'll keep the press up to date, as always."
Some journalists would challenge this argument: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since 10 September.
The broadcaster, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of information lessons was not the result of deliberately disappointing TV journalists, although he added: “I do not object to the fact that they have been disappointed.”
He then suggested direct contact between Trump and the press.
The President will do more questions and answers than any president before him," he said, without adding any evidence: "We have looked at these numbers."
The briefings continue, Sanders confirmed, but “when the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly from the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of things, and you've seen how we've been doing it in the last few weeks, so it's going to take place during the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States of America."
Trump will regularly answer questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with guests.
Solo's press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president, perhaps, demonstrated why, before attending the assembled journalists on a leisure trip and sometimes in a strange look.
The Minister of Health wrote to EU workers in NHS Scotland about Brexit’s fears
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in NHS in Scotland to express their gratitude and wish to be present after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent his letter if the United Kingdom has been out of the EU for less than six months.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering expenditure related to the established status of EU citizens working in its public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “In the summer negotiations have continued on the withdrawal between the United Kingdom and the EU, heading towards the expected decisions of the autumn.
However, the UK Government has also made preparations for a possible non-agreement scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for you.
That's why I wanted to repeat how much I appreciate every employee's contribution, regardless of his nationality.
Professional partners from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and benefit patients and communities that we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie passed the emergency surgery after the head trauma
Christion Abercrombie, the Tennessee State Tigers support player, performed an extraordinary operation after the main injury and defeat on Saturday 31 : 27 from Vanderbilt Commodores, published by Mike Organ Tennessee.
Tennessee State's head coach Rod Reed told the journalists that the injury happened just before the halftimes.
"He fell on the side and just collapsed," said Reed.
Coachs and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side before being placed on the carrier frame for further inspection from the field.
The Tennessee State official told Chris Harris (WSMV - Nashville, Tennessee) that the Abercrombie operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there are no details of the type/range of the injury yet, and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
The second year of Abercrombie with the red shirt was in Tennessee State during her first season after the crossing from Illinois.
He had five battles on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 fights this season.
Foreign buyers pay higher stamp duty when purchasing real estate in Britain
Foreign buyers must pay higher stamp duty if they purchase real estate in the United Kingdom using this additional money to help the homeless under the new Tory plans.
It's a way of damaging Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters.
The stamp duty will apply to those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that it will create up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers have to pay a higher tax on stamps when they buy real estate in the United Kingdom, using this additional money to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
Movement is considered to be an attempt to unharmed Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters with promises to offer them affordable housing and to target people with high incomes.
The stamp duty will be applied to individuals and companies who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom, directing the additional money to the government's desire to combat homelessness.
The premium - which is in addition to this tax on temples, including the higher levels introduced two years ago in the second home and purchases linked to refurbishment - may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance expects this movement to generate up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of the property purchased in London belongs to non-UK residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to get their feet down when purchasing housing.
Many of the wealthy regions of the country - especially in the capital - have become ‘creative cities’ thanks to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country.
A new policy will only arrive a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the tax on temples to help young people get their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping real estate prices high, if they buy land but do not use it, and invited Maya to give up affordable home quotas in order to improve Britain's "hot shame".
Corbyn has announced the reform of the eye-catching residential economy, including the control of rent and the cessation of the harassment of innocent people.
It also wants to give the councils greater powers to build new homes.
May said: “At last year I promised my commitment as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream — that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means improving our broken housing market.
Britain is always open to people who want to live here, work and build their own lives here.
It is, however, right that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies located abroad, are as easy to buy homes as British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of having a home has become too far away, and tough sleeping conditions are a normal reality."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland"
The leader of Sunderlan, Jack Ross, says that his "final goal" is to become the leader of Scotland at some point.
The Scottish (42) welcomes the challenge of revitalizing the North-East club, which is currently the third in League One, with only 3 points behind it.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Masters League last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got to class B and that's what it was all about," Ross told the BBC Scotland show Sports Sound.
“But I grew up with my father looking at Scotland in the Hampden, and that’s always something that has pulled me back.
This option, however, will only come if I succeed in managing the club."
Ross' predecessors, Mr. Sunderland, have been head of Dick Advocate, Mr. David Moyes, Mr. Sam Allerdyce, Mr. Martin O'Neill, Mr. Roy Keane, Mr. Gus Poyet and Mr. Paulo Di Canio.
Former Head of Allaoa Athletic says that he did not fear such great and well-known names, having previously endured both in Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"It's a success for me right now if I can take this club to the League of Masters."
Because of its structure and facilities, this club is undoubtedly part of the Masters League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get here, but I can only see myself as successful if I can get the club back there."
Ross has worked as a leader for only three years, being presiding Deputy Director of Dumbarton and 15 months among Hears' leading staff.
Then he helped Alloo recover from the third level and made St Mirren the lowest position winner of the next championship.
And Ross says he's more comfortable now than he was in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academics during his career.
“It was a real crossroads,” he recalled the takeover of Alla.
“I really believed that management is more suitable for me than playing.
It seems strange because I did it, received a reasonable income, and enjoyed a few peaks.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot of things to be done every week.
I am still experiencing this in the light of the tension and pressure of my work, but the management just seems to be more appropriate.
I've always wanted to drive, and now I'm doing it, and I feel more comfortable now than ever when I was a grown-up."

According to the study, the best time for the surface is at 5.30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat has improved the turnover of British troubled pubs, but more pressure has been placed on restaurant chains.
The figures showed that the turnover of pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, while restaurants had decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a representative of CGA’s business consulting company, wrote: “The continuing participation of the sun and England in world championships meant that July was similar to June, when pubs’ turnover increased by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants became even more difficult.
In June, the trading of reduced restaurants deteriorated further in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars were the most successful trades, and restaurants that sought to be the worst.
Food - based pubs suffered despite the sun, though not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between controlled pubs and bars, the sales of beverages increased by 6.6 per cent in the month, while the sales of food fell by three per cent."
Paul Newman, an analyst for leisure and hospitality, said: “These results are continuing the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sports events remain the biggest factor in sales outside the home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant chains continue to fight, although the decrease in sales by 4.8% compared to last year is particularly painful in addition to the current price pressure.
Long and hot summers could not have come at a worse time for food business and only time shows whether the more moderate temperatures we have experienced in August provide some urgent relief."
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown of trade mark-related institutions.
The sales monitor of the Coffer Peach Tracker industry in the UK's pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyses performance data from the 47 operational groups, with a total turnover of over GBP 9 billion, and is a well established industry benchmark.
One of the five children has secret social media accounts they hide from their parents
The study concluded that one of the five children, some of them 11 years old, has secret social media accounts they hide from their parents and teachers.
A study among 20,000 gymnasts found growth in “Velts Insta” pages
The news heightened the fear that sexual content would be posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a basic account to show parents.
The study concluded that one child in five, some only 11 years old, creates secret social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study among 20,000 gymnasts found a marked increase in “Vallts Insta” accounts (reference to the list of images on Instagram).
The news heightened the fear that sexual content would be posted.
Twenty per cent of the students said they had a basic account to show the parents as well as an acceptable one.
One of my 13-year-old daughter's secret pages saw that the teenager called others to rape.
Digital Software UK and Headmasters" and Headmistrasses" Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles and half of them recognised the existence of personal accounts.
HMC leader Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing to see that so many teenagers are tempted to create accounts online where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilith Doyle will be the spokesperson for athletes at the Scottish Athletics Board.
Eilith Doyle was elected head of the management's executive management at the annual meeting of the Scottish Athletics Board.
Doyle is one of the most respected lightweights in Scotland, and Chairman Ian Beattie described what happened as a good opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from his extensive international experience in the last decade.
“Eilidhi is respected everywhere in Scotland, in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in sports communities, and we are confident that Scottish athletes will reap the benefits of inviting her management,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I wish to be a spokesperson for athletes, and I hope that I can make a real contribution to Scotland's sport and contribute to its development."
An American who won four Olympic gold at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games at 200 metres and 400 metres in total and now often shares his opinion in the BBC could not walk after the transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I received a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said if I was going to recover, and then, to what extent, only time would show.
I've done a hard job, but I've fully recovered, I've learned to walk again and I'm already doing speed training!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
Breast pump advertising that compares women to cows, divides the Internet into two
The breast pump company has shared the Internet with two camper ads comparing the suckling mother with milking cows.
According to reports, in order to celebrate the presentation of the “first silent breast pump in the world”, the consumer technology company Elvis published a similar advertising on ironic music video in order to present the freedom that this new pump gives to mothers who want to live.
Four true mothers dance in a table filled with hay with cows and sing, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see my tail" and "If you didn't notice, these aren't the cubs, these are my breasts."
Repeats the verse: "Pump, pump, feed children, pump, pump, fill my ladies with milk."
However, advertisements published on the company's Facebook page have created opposite opinions on the Internet.
77,000 times viewed and thousands of comments from video viewers disagree, many of them say that it illuminates behind the tents of the dairy industry.
‘The use of cows to promote this product was a very poor decision.
As we do, they must become pregnant and give birth to milk, but the difference is that children are stolen from them within the days of birth," wrote one.
Elvis's breast pump does not stick to the eyes of the breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commentator said: “It is obvious that it is traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not use these children to promote a mother's breast pump?"
Someone added, "A totally unspeakable ad."
A woman thought the story was super fun.
“I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I were still breast-feeding.
Pumping milk made me feel like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but let's just take it the way it is.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another commented: “This is fun advertising for mothers who are pumping (often in their own workplaces or in the bathrooms) and who feel like cows.
This advertising does not praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they've all danced in bras with non-sightly pumps.
The idea of a campaign is based on the fact that many women pumping milk from their breasts feel like cows.
However, Elvis Pump is completely quiet, no wires, no pipes, and does not look like a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep children and even go outside while pumping.
Mother’s partner and ECD Ana Balarin commented: “Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserves a bold and annoying introduction.
In comparison with women's opportunities for expression and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all its challenges, while presenting in a entertaining and familiar key the extraordinary sense of freedom created by the new pump.
This isn't the first time the news has reflected Elvis's pump.
In London’s fashion week, the mother of two children carrying Marta Jakubowski’s product appeared on display.
Thousands of migrant children quietly went to Texas border tent camp
The number of children arrested has increased sharply, although monthly border crossings have remained quite the same, partly because the harsh rhetoric and politics put in place by the Trump administrator have made it difficult to establish children with the help of sponsors.
Usually, most sponsors are document-based immigrants and are afraid to violate the possibility of remaining in their country, so the child's right to care is required.
The threat increased in June when national authorities announced that potential sponsors and other household adults could provide fingerprints and data sharing with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, the senior immigration and customs administration officer, admitted to Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied for financial support for non-emergency minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no criminal history.
"About 80 per cent of sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegally present in the country and a large number of them have criminal backgrounds.
So let's keep following them," said Mr. Albence.
In order to deal with children more quickly, officials enforced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of the arrest.
Many defend their legal content to the judge of immigration by means of a videoconferencing.
Ineligible to be released, the state is quickly deported.
According to the asylum workers and based on the system reports published in recent months - the longer the child is in custody, the more likely they are to become nervous or depressed, which can cause violent protests or attempts to escape.
According to the lawyers, these concerns are more topical in large detention facilities such as the Tornillo, where the child may be caught in difficulties due to the size of his or her eyes.
They added that moving children to the tent without giving up enough time to get used to hours or to say goodbye to friends can cause traumas that many already have difficulties with.
Syria calls for the immediate departure of the US, French and Turkish occupational forces
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem invited Syrian refugees to come home at the UN General Assembly, even though the country has been at war for the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally involved in the fight against terrorism on the Syrian soil and are being dealt with accordingly.
“They must leave immediately and unconditionally, he said in the Assembly.
Moualem claimed that the “war against terrorism is almost over. Since 2011, more than 360 000 people have died and millions have left their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to fight “in this holy war until we have cleaned up the whole territory of Syria” both from terrorist groups and from “any foreign force illegally present.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and consulting the Kurdish units as well as Syrian Arabs, who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
In France, more than 1,000 troops have been ravaged from war.
Speaking on the issue of war refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were appropriate and that he accused the senseless fears that prevented refugees from coming, spreading part of the Western countries.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help with their neighbours," he said.
"They are politicalising something that is just a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no rehabilitation aid will be granted to Syria until there is an end to the war between Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which will create an Idlib buffer zone in the last rebel base, has created an opportunity to make progress with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented the widespread raid of the Syrian forces supported by Russia in the province of three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem stressed that the treaty had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would hit the Nusra Front soldiers associated with the jihadists, including Al-Qaida, who would be "killed".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes soon to convince the new Committee of Government and opposition members to draft the post-war Syrian Constitution and pave the way for election.
Moualem made demands for the Syrian Government to participate in the Committee, saying that the panel's work could be limited to reviewing the current constitutional articles and warned against interference.
Why Trump is also elected for the second term of office
According to this logic, Trump could win in the next elections in 2020 if his office and scandal have not been completed before, as likely by liberal viewers.
Which would undoubtedly be "the most exciting end of the presidency!"
At the moment, the viewers do not show signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak-hour ratings have doubled in CNN by more than 1.05 million and in MSNBC almost tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on top. Compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, their number has increased. MSNBC will receive the Rachel Maddown Show with 3.5 million cable viewers who have kept its rating high during the main evening news.
“This is the tension that we are involved in, because we do not understand it,” said ABC’s head of drama “Designed Survivor” about the Secretary of State, who will become president if the attack destroys Parliament’s building.
Nell Scovell, who is an experienced comedy writer and the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, is a second theory.
He remembers the pre-election taxi ride in Boston.
The driver told him he was voting for Mr Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
“He said he made me laugh,” said Mrs Scovell.
All this chaos has entertaining value.
Of course, not as any other TV show, Washington’s rumors can be fatal to Roe v. Wade’s future and to the reuniting immigrant families and the global economy.
Avoiding the theme is only a luxury for the viewers.
However, the six-hour talk show of Bob Woodward’s “baseline background study” for his book ‘Fear’ and Paul Manafort 13 225,73€ from the ostriches of Bomber jacket (Washington Post said about it in “extreme self-assuring clothing”) and Stormy Daniels’ motives regarding the description of Mr Trump’s anatomy ore, the viewer is more than a educated citizen.
For example, I will never watch Super Mario feel the same again.
“One of his activities, which may seem like a reality series, is that he shares something every night,” said the CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the series Brent Montgomery Trump with intermediate actors and day-to-day plans (breeding with NFL, Kim Jong-uni praise).
You can't skip two or you'll be down for a while.
At Fleiss's place this week, her home was 80 degrees north of Kauai, but she was in a room to watch MSNBC while she was recording CNN.
He was unable to give up watching Brett Kavanaugh deal with the Senate Legal Committee and how the fate of the Supreme Court hangs on his hair.
“I remember how we did all sorts of crazy shows in our time, and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” said Mr Fleiss.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

There's cash flow to the most acute White House intermediate.
It is no wonder that District 17 of Pennsylvania receives a cash flow through the restructuring of the Congressional Region, receiving two dominant undertakings in the same place.
As a result, Conor Lamb, who won a seat in the second district in the last spring in extraordinary elections, was once again elected.
The Lamb’s opponent is Keith Rothfus, a Republican who is currently representing the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17 in the larger section.
The maps were changed following the January decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which is why the old districts were divided into constitutional electoral regions, favouring the Republicans.
The new 17th election has launched a campaign in which the financial departments of the largest political parties - the Democratics' campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Committee for the Republican campaign (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a shortage of victory much viewed in the March 18th Congress District of Pennsylvania in extraordinary elections.
This has been the case for several decades, and President Donald Trump won the division by 20 points.
Political opinionators have given the Democrats a small advantage.
The US El Salvador was punished for supporting China and then withdrawn
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama already acknowledged Beijing, a small setback to Washington.
Mr Trump met Juan Carlos Varela, President of Panama in a friendly atmosphere in June 2017 and held a Panaman hotel until the partners expelled Trump's corporate administrative team.
The Foreign Ministry officials decided to recall the American leaders of the diplomatic mission from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama, as the Ministry's press representative Heather Nauert said earlier this month that these countries had recently stopped supporting Taiwan.
However, only El Salvador was planned to be punished, which received USD 140 million in 2017 from the United States, including drug surveillance, development and economic impetus.
The recommended penalties, including reductions in financial assistance and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment rate and the number of killings.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity to organise a waste of a similar meeting that took place last year, which was seen as a development in efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But in the middle of September, the high officials explained that they wanted to continue the meeting and conclude the debate on any penalties in El Salvador.
According to the diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pence is now being judged, who will speak at a meeting in mid-October to speak about the views of the government.
And three American ambassadors secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new hard reports or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesperson, Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the three American officials, including the two diplomats who agreed to discuss national discussions on the request for anonymousness.
Their discussions were confirmed by a close analyst who also spoke on request of anonymity.
Study History
Next, special prosecutor Robert Mueller will publish a report on Trump's possible justice, for which there is a lot of evidence in the state archive.
Mueller is also allegedly investigating whether Trump's campaign is related to Russia's attack on our elections.
If Congress had to change the party, Trump would have to make sense of this institution as if it were going to go back to talking to voters and perhaps even its peers.
There are many, and I do not want to point out that the withdrawal of Trump and his European counterparts is inevitable.
We all on both sides of the Atlantic need to make a choice that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938 the German officials were ready for a coup against Hitler if only the West had prevented him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent multi-annual slaughters.
History goes around such turning points and the unloved march of democracy is getting closer or delayed.
The Americans are now facing a number of turning points.
What do we do when Trump fires Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in boiling water since it was announced that last year he proposed secret recording of the president and speculationd that he was incompatible with his position.
Rosenstein says The Times' statement is inaccurate.
"How to react if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete and fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite reliable accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, do we vote for Congress in the middle elections if Trump is to be responsible?
If these tests fail, democracy will take a long winter vacation.
But I believe we will not fail because we have learned from Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once took over and used our ambassador's home.
He survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, he sent me a Sabbath candle light on a board with a hammer.
With this legacy, how should I not be optimistic about our future?"
Brookings Institution's Senior Officer Norman Eisen, who is also the leader of the Washington Citizens' Association of Responsibility and Ethics, and the book The Last Palace: the restless century of Europe in five lives and one legendary residence.
The Rangers' Graham Dorrans is optimistic before the Rapid Vienna battle.
The Rangers will organise Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over Australia, which followed the impressive fig that was received in Spain at the beginning of this month against Villarreal, will put them in a strong position to become the European League G Group.
Kneel injury did not allow the central player Graham Dorrans to see the first appearance of the season before 2 : 2 pin-on game against Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a board for better results.
“This was a good point for us, because Villarrea has a strong opponent,” said a 31-year-old player.
“We went to the game believing that we could achieve something and left the game with a point.
Perhaps we could have achieved more, but it was generally a fair result.
They were better in the first half of the game, and we in the second half of the game.
Thursday will be another great and important European night.
Hopefully we get three points, but this is going to be a hard game because they got a good result in their last game, but since the people support us, I'm sure we can bring ourselves together and get a good result.
Last year was hard, thanks to this, I was injured and changes took place inside the club, but now we all feel good inside.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; training is good.
I hope we can move forward now, leave behind last season and be successful."
Women cannot sleep because of the fear of pension insurance
Despite the fact that the interviewers had a clear idea of how they wanted to be looked after, few discussed it with their family members.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their husbands about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 percent said they've talked to their children about it.
“People want family members to take care of them, but at the same time they do not speak on this subject,” explained Holly Snyder, Nationalwide’s Vice President for Life Insurance.
This should, however, begin.
Talk to your husband and children: You cannot prepare your family for care unless they know your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and family by discussing where and how to get care, as these choices may be extremely important in relation to costs.
Talk to your financial advisor: Your advisor may have a good plan on how to pay for these costs.
Your funding options for long-term care may include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with financial value to help cover these costs, or an asset self-insurance policy - as long as you have the necessary money.
Prepare your legal documents: Stop all possible legal battles already in the front.
Ask yourself for a health certificate to identify a trustee who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals follow your wishes at a time when you cannot communicate.
Also consider the trustee in relation to your funding.
Choose a reliable person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid even if you are incapable.
Do not forget small details: Imagine that your old mother has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write these things down so you'll be ready if you have to.
"This is not only a financial aspect, it is also important who would be doctors?" Martin explained.
“What are the drugs needed?
Who takes care of the dog?
Put it all in place."
Ilfracombe has been shot several times at a gun.
The master fan was fired from the air gun several times when he was on his way home after a night out.
In the '40s, the victim was shot in the Ilfracombe, in the Oxford Grove area, in Devon's chest search, in his stomach and in his hands.
The police described the shooting of the night at about 02.30 a.m. as a random act.
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are asking all Witnesses to contact him.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit Palu in the Indonesian city of Indonesia on Friday, officials reported that the number of deaths was still increasing.
As the communication has been broken, the rescuers have not received any information from the Donggala agency north of Palu, which is near to the epicentral of the 7.5 Magnite earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
The following are some important facts concerning Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawes, located on the narrow Gulf of Sulawes on the west coast of the island of Sulawes, and the population was estimated to be 379 800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was suddenly hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
The Donggala Regent is an area extending over 300 km (180 km) in the north-west part of the island of Sulawes.
The Regent, an administrative area under the province, was estimated at 299 200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of the Central Sulawes province, in particular the Donggala coastal area.
The mining of nickel, which is mainly concentrated on the opposite coast of Morowal, Sulawes, is also important in the province.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, tsunamis have hit Palu and Donggala several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people in Donggala and destroyed hundreds of houses.
In 1996, the western part of Donggala was hit by tsunami killing nine.
Indonesia is seismically located in the Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
The following are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: The great earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh, Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, triggered a tsunami which struck 14 countries and killed 226 000 people on the Indian coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: In March and early April, a number of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8-degree earthquake hit Indonesia's most populated south of Java Island, creating a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: The area near Patang, the capital of Western Sumatra Province, was hit by an earthquake of 7.6 degrees.
Killed over 1,100 people.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 degrees hit one of the Sumatra Islands - the island of Mentawai, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 metres high, destroying dozens of villages and killing some 300 people.
2016: The deep earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh, sowing destruction and panic, reminding people of the death of the earthquake in 2004 and the destruction of the tsunami.
Tsunam was not produced at that time, but more than 100 people died in collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Indonesia by killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily abandoned thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for charges of domestic violence.
The oldest son of Track Palin, former Governor of Alaska, and vice-president of the Vice-President, Sarah Palin, has been arrested in connection with the attack.
According to a report published by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, Palin (29) was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, in connection with suspicions of domestic violence, interference in domestic violence and resistance to arrest.
According to a police report, when a female tried to inform the police about the alleged crimes, Palin took his phone.
The Palin is held at the Mat-Su preliminary investigation office and held against an outstanding bail of 500 dollars, reported by KKUU.
He appeared on Saturday in court, where he declared that he was “in no way guilty,” reported a news network
The Palin is facing three class A misdemeanors, which means that he can be expected to be imprisoned for up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been accused of a class B misdemeanor, which is punishable by a one-day imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with a criminal charge.
He was accused of attacking Father Todd Palin in December 2017.
In connection with the alleged attack, his mother, Sarah Palin, was called by the police.
The case is currently being discussed by the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic attack, of interference with the domestic violence report and possession of a weapon, all in a state of drunkenness.
His friend said he hit him in the face.
Veterans groups criticised Sarah Palin in 2016 when she linked her son to the violent conduct of PTSD, which is due to her service in Iraq.
The tsunami followed the earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died following an earthquake on the island of Sulawes, Indonesia, Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake triggered the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working and the number of victims is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake struck the outskirts of the downtown town of Sulawes, which lies northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
The social media shows videos showing the moment of the earthquake.
Hundreds of people had gathered at the festival on the shore of the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors in NYC are seeking a rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks.
Federal prosecutors in New York are applying for the death penalty against Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of indictment of eight people in the New York terrorist attack, and this rare punishment has not been carried out for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov (30) allegedly used Home Depot's rental car to attack bicycle roads along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, cutting pedestrians and cyclists on their way in October.
According to the request for a death penalty in the south of New York, prosecutors have to prove that Saipov deliberately killed eight victims and caused serious injuries on purpose.
In both cases, on the basis of the case-files, there is a potential death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury issued a 22-point charge to the whole of Saipov, which included eight counts of murder charges involving extortion commonly used by federal prosecutors in organised crime, and charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “several planning and intent,” said the prosecutors, describing the action of Saipov as “murderful, cruel and depraved.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damascus Pagnucco’s family and friends,” says the report.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last death of the New York South District District District Court.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but as a result he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death sentence was executed in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a federal case in New York, where a married couple were executed after the conviction in a conspiracy for spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an ancient worm, showed no regret in the days and months following the attack, according to the documents of the court.
According to the police, he had told the investigators that he was pleased with what he did.
According to the charges, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack to set up the ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, he also wanted the ISIS flag to be exhibited in his hospital palace.
In a 22-point charge, he hasn't taken the blame.
David Patton, a national defender in Saipov, said that they were “extremely disappointed” in the decision under procedure.
"In our view, the decision to apply for the death penalty will prolong the trauma of all those affected by the death penalty," said Patton.
Previously, Saipov's defense team asked the prosecutors not to file a death sentence.
According to Tory's Member, NIGEL FARAGE should be appointed to lead the Brexit negotiations.
During today's Tory Conference protest, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the People's Army".
The former UKIP leader said that politicians had to "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics, as one of Theresa May's own parliamentary members recommended to lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a simple member of the conservative Lower House, said on Mars in Birmingham, that the UK would "be out by now" if Mr Farage were the secretary of Brexit.
However, Mrs May is facing the problem of reinvigorating her deeply divided lines, which were stressed by the conservatives in favour of staying, joining her protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is in trouble with keeping his Chequers plan in the middle of Brexit supporters, the icers and the EU attacks.
The Allies called for it to continue the transaction with Brussels, despite its opposition, and for Eurosceptics and Liberals to choose between their own package and their "loss".
Bone said at the meeting in Solihull that he wanted to give up Chequers' plan.
He recommended taking Farage as a partner and giving him responsibility in negotiations with Brussels.
'In his responsibility we'd be out by now,' he said.
Wellingborough, Member of Parliament, added: "I stand outside Brexit, but we must give up Chequers' plan."
In reflecting his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be subject.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone rejected the recommendations that the public opinion has now changed since the vote in 2016: "The belief that the British people have changed their minds and wish to remain is not true."
Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of Tory Brexit, was also on the march and told the reporters: “I only say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to people.
“The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our party and among our activists who actually walk the streets and choose us at all.
Please leave the Chequers plan and start listening."
With a message directed at Mayle, he added: “The Prime Ministers can keep their jobs if they keep their promises.”
Farage said that the politicians who were attending the meeting should be placed “to feel the heat” when they plan to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us – people – and our political class" he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that "we're not going to let that happen."
He added: “I want you to make our political class at the edge of Brexit’s treason uncomfortable.
"We are mobilizing the national army that gave us a victory with Brexit, and we will not rest until we reach an independent, local, proud Britain."
At the same time, the icers marched through Birmingham before the two - hour gathering at the center of the city.
A handful of activists were waving "Torians Against Brexit" slogans after the group was set up this weekend.
The Liberal Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security issues that were involved in their party's application when the conference was opened.
"These are people who say that IT systems can be established and all technology can be brought to Canada and more, would be a smooth border crossing, a cross-border trade in Ireland without restrictions," he added.
“This is a full farce.
There is no such thing as good Brexit," he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
According to Elizabeth Warren, the United States is seriously considering running for president after the elections in November.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future on Saturday at the West Massachusetts Town Hall.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will be running against Geoff Diehl, GOP’s National Representative, who was Vice Chairman of the Massachusetts campaign in Trump in November next election.
Speculating that it may be against Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in the Town Hall after Trump took office.
The host asked if he was going to run for president.
Warren replied: “It is time for women to go to Washington and improve our broken government, which means that it is also on the front.”
There was an arrest for shooting LSU Sims.
On Saturday, the L.A.P.D. in Baton Rouge reported that a suspect in the murder of the shooting of LSU basketballman Wayde Sims took place on LSU Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department reported 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson's arrest at 11 o'clock in the morning at the ET News Conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help to identify a man on the frames.
A 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University City early Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died behind it,” said Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, through 247sport.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and got shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned, and he confessed to being on the scene, possession of a gun, and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
The young man Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games last season, 10 of them in his original composition, an average of 17.4 minutes, throwing 5.6 points and taking 2.9 tableballs per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the world champion after the team records gave him the victory over Sebastian Vettet.
From this moment on, it became clear that Valteri Bottas qualified Lewis Hamilton for the great role of the Mercedes team in the race.
Bottas was a good start and left Hamilton almost neglected when he first defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first went to the boxing stops and left the back of the Hamilton group in close traffic, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the box stop round later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton went next to him to lead when the Ferrari leader willingly left the inner side to pass after the attempt to protect it with a double move.
Max Verstappen started the competition from the rear row of the square and was the seventh in his 21st birthday at the end of the first round.
He then led the competition most of the time, driving towards the finish of rubbers and passing Kim from Räikkönen, taking the fourth place.
He finally took the 44th round to the box stop, but he failed to increase the speed of the last eight rounds, which gave Räikkönen the fourth place.
It's a tough day because Valter did a good job all week and was a real gentleman walking me around.
“The crew has done an excellent job to have one of the two,” said Hamilton.
It was a very poor body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at his Saturday gathering because of the incident that he had not leaked a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accused of sexual harassment of the former Supreme Court's nominal Brett Kavanaugh.
When speaking about the meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly address the testimony issued by Ford before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, but instead commented on what is happening in the Senate at the moment, which shows that people are “bad, disgusting and lying”.
“The only beautiful thing that has happened in the Senate in a few days is that you see anger and anger, evil, disgusting and lying people,” he said.
“Look at the press releases and the leaks they say: “Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember his answer to the question, “Did you leak the document?" — Ah, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak," he added to the senator's face.
In July, Ford sent a letter to Feinstein about the charges against Kavanaugh and it was leaked at the beginning of September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his job.
The Hill stated: “I did not hide Dr. Ford’s accusations or leak his story,” Feinstein told the Committee.
"He asked me to keep confidentiality, and I did so according to his request."
However, his denial was not suitable for the president who commented during the gathering on Saturday: “You know what, it was a very poor body language.
Maybe he didn't, but it's one of the worst body languages I've ever seen."
Continuing the protection of the Supreme Court candidate accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that Democrats use these charges for their own purposes.
“They have decided to take back the power without choosing the resources.
You see this evil and disgustingness, and those who are hurt by them, who need to drive over to gain power and control," said the Media President.
Eliteliiga: Dundee Stars 5 : 3 Belfast Giants
Giant Patrick Dwyer created two gates against Dundee
Dundee Stars won the Belfast Giants at the re-election of the Friday elite League on Saturday, who lost to Dundee 5 : 3.
Giants took the game early with two gates to lead Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home team to the fig before Dwyer took the Giants back to lead.
Francois Bouchard equalized Dundee's position before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's gates secured their victory.
It was the third loss for Adam Keefe's men, who came to Belfast on Friday night to win the Dundeed as of 2 : 1.
It was the fourth meeting of the parties of the season, of which the Giants won three previous games.
The Dwyer Open Gate came at 3:35 a.m. with the help of Kendall McFaull and David Rutherford, when Beauvillier doubled the ground four minutes later.
Sullivan brought the home team back to the game in a hurry of 13:10 before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie hit the violin gate at 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants would lead before the first break, catching the end of the first third of their evening at the second gate.
On the home field, players regrouped and Bouchard put them back on the ground with the numerical overweight of the minute 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen first give Dundee a leading position at the end of the second third of the game, securing the victory in the last third of his team's attack zone.
The Giants, who have now lost four out of the last five games, will meet Milton Keynes at home in the next game.
The pilot dies to save hundreds of people from the earthquake.
One Indonesian air traffic controller was declared a hero after he gave his life to ensure safe take-off of hundreds of people.
The great earthquake that struck the island of Sulawes Friday caused the tsunami, after which more than 800 people were killed, many of whom were unknownly lost.
The region is surrounded by strong extremisms and many people are trapped under the ruins of the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung’s colleagues fled from the fluctuating tower at the airport of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri, he refused to leave.
He remained at the post to ensure that, at the same time, Batik Air flight No 6321 was safe for take-off.
Then he jumped out of the flight tower thinking it would collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia’s press representative Yohannes Sirait confirmed that his decision might have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia’s ABC News.
We set up a helicopter to transport Kalimantan from Balikpapan to another city's major hospital.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before he arrived at the helicopter's prayer.
"We were extremely sad when we heard of it." added the spokesperson.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can increase to thousands. According to the National Disaster Reduction Agency, access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was restricted.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's press officer, said: "The number of deaths can increase, because the bodies of many victims are still in ruins and have not been saved."
The six-metre waves destroyed the city of Palu, where mass burial takes place on Sunday.
Military and passenger aircraft provide assistance and equipment.
Risa Kusuma, 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “Ray help will make new sacrifices every minute.
Clean water is rare.
Small markets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we cannot tell them what they can find there.
It is already a tragedy, but the situation may get even worse."
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, arrived on Sunday at Palusse, and told the army of the country: “Please work nights and days to carry out all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready for that?" reported CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Lomboki, in Indonesia, suffered an earthquake involving more than 550 deaths.
Micronesian aviation accident: Air Niugini claims that one man has disappeared since the lagoon air accident.
Although it was said earlier that all 47 passengers and the crew were safely evacuated from a submerged plane, the airline now claims that the plane that crashed the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia was missing.
Air Niugini said in his statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not find one male passenger.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately reply to the passenger’s details, such as questions about his age and nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crews after the plane crashed to Chuuk's airport when it landed.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but they were stable.
The circumstances of the accident and the exact chain of events are still unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said that the plane landed far from the lagoon airway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane was passing the flight path.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane was flying very low when it landed.
"This is very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the rest of the passengers were able to arm the sinking plane in the high water until the emergency exit.
He mentioned that cabin crew were panicking and screaming and that he had a little head trauma.
The U.S. Navy and sailors who worked on a nearby well also helped to rescue people by using full - breathing boats to take them to the shore before the plane sank about 30 metres [30 m] below water.
The safety data provided by the Air Safety Network show that 111 people have died in air accidents involving air carriers registered to PNG in the last two decades, but none of them were related to Air Niugin.
Analyst is preparing a schedule for the night the woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecution closed the case for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The US Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett spent several hours as an expert observer in the analysis of intelligence data.
He pointed out to the jury how he used his mobile phone extracts to re-establish the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers' movements on the night of her death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he received location information from several mobile phones indicating that Telli was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to the earlier claims made by the young man.
When the data showed that he had been with Chambers, the young man himself claimed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, which is why the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford joined the courtroom on Saturday and admitted that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis had told the truth when he said he had been in Sanford's car, Sanford said that Tellis was "false because my car was in Nashville".
Another mismatch was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
The phone records showed that women had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers died, Tellis erased Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from her life," said Hale.
The defense is planning to make its trial call on Sunday.
The judge said he thought the case was going to be discussed by the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is aware of the hippop?
Hypop trio wants to fight negative genre definition by adding positive messages to music.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that the hiphop has moved away from its political message and social problem-solving initiatives.
They want to go back to the roots of the hippo and make the conscious hippo popular again.
Bands such as The Fugees and Common have recently re-encouraged popularity in Britain thanks to bands such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
New York babysitter's suing a racist message for a couple of months.
A couple of times after an accidental message from the mother, where the mother complained that the nanny was a ‘serious black’, the New York nanny was suing the court for discriminatory dismissal.
Couples deny that they're racists compared to blackmail.
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed her resentment when she learned that their new child care provider Giselle Maurice was black when she came to work on the first day in 2016.
Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to her husband saying: "EIIIIIIIII III, JERJEKORD MUSTANAHAL."
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, the uncomfortable Plasco-Flaxman, after understanding his protagonist, fired Miss Maurice, claiming that their social babysitter, who was African American, had done a bad job and he had been waiting for the Philippines instead.
Miss Maurice was paid one working day and then sent home with Uber.
Now Maurice appeals to a couple of courts to obtain compensation for the dismissal she wants to receive on a daily basis for the next six months, and for the same work she was initially hired to do, but without a contract.
"I want to show them so that they can do it," he said to The Post, adding, "I know that this is discrimination."
A couple have rejected the claim that they are racists, saying that it was reasonable to end their business with Maurice, because they feared that they could not trust her again after insulting her.
“My wife sent him something he didn’t mean.
He's not a racer.
“We are not racists,” said the wife’s wife Joel Plasco to The Post.
“But would you let your children be kept by someone with whom you have been rude, even if it was involuntary?
My newborn?
Come on."
Commenting on the comparison with blackmail, Plasco said that his wife was two months away from the birth of a child and was in a "very difficult situation" situation.
“Could you go against someone like that?
That's not very nice now," added the investment banker.
Although the case is still ongoing, the public opinion has quickly condemned a few in social media, where they are severely judged because of their behaviour and their thinking.
The new letter reveals that the Paddington publishers were afraid that readers would not deal with a talking bear.
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born immediately after the adoption of the book, wrote: “It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of a man who read it for the first time before publication.
It's very fun now to know what we know about Paddington's great success."
He said that his father, who was inspired to write a children’s book on a small bear, worked as a cameraman for BBC, would have been optimistic about rejecting his work, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book was by the death of his father with a shadow of a nucleus last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom he described as “a very important member of our family”, he added that his father was silently proud of his final success.
"He was quite a quiet man and was not a proud man," he said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like a feeling when your child achieves something: you are proud of them, even though it is not your achievement directly.
I believe he looked at Paddington's success in this way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always acknowledged Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
On the ground, his daughter was rushed to Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctors worked in vain to save his life.
“They called regularly to say that her condition was very bad and that they did not believe that she would survive,” said Mrs Ednan-Laperous.
“Then I received a call from Nadi, who said that my daughter would die in two minutes, and I have to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said: “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll see you soon.
Soon I'll be with you.
The medications the doctors gave him to keep his heart beating began to disappear quietly and to leave his body.
He was just before then dead, and now all the systems started to stop working.
All I had to do was sit there and wait, knowing what was going to happen.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to stay together."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperous, who now mourned her daughter, went on a plane with other passengers who knew nothing about her experiences.
"No one knew that," he said.
“I kept my head down, and tears flowed all this time.
It's hard to explain, but on this flight, I felt terrible sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her."
Post-cards from a grieving woman prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones’s way of killing themselves work together to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have glued cards to the Wales Bridge with inspiring messages and telephone numbers that people can call for support.
Miss Davis' son Tyler was 13, when she suffered from depression, and 18 when she killed herself.
"I do not want any parent to feel what I feel every day," he said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
“All knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile would make the whole room shine."
Nevertheless, he stopped working before he died because he was "in a very bad place with his own."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old, found his brother after he had taken his own life.
Mrs Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that it has a domino effect."
Miss Davis created these maps “to let people know that there are people to approach and talk to, even their friend.
Don't shut up – you have to talk."
Ms. Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms. Davis for years, lost Mark, a 15-year-old partner, not long after the husband's mother died.
"He did not say that he felt unwell or depressed or anything," he said.
“We noticed a change in his behaviour a few days before Christmas.
He was at the lowest point on his first Christmas holiday – when the children opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them or anything."
Ms. Humphreys said that the man’s death was a terrible trauma to them, but they have to deal with it: “It’s tearing the wound into the entire family.
It'll tear us apart.
But we have to move on and continue the fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on hair while the FBI starts investigating.
“I believed that if we could actually have something he wanted – a limited time and scope study – we might be able to achieve unity,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the Committee would “fall together” in the midst of a persistent blockade.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate it?
Their opposition was due to timing.
The interim elections will be in just five weeks, on 6 November. If the Republicans are not expected to do well, they will be visibly weakened in their intentions of becoming the head of the world's highest court.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone to call the senators by lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI presents its report?
The vote will take place in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes in the Senate to allow Vice-President Mike Pence to give a decisive vote and to confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
The number of troops in North Korea “returns” under Kim’s government
South Korea's legislation has said that the number of North Korea's troops in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
The Park Byeong-seug, quoting South Korea's data from the Ministry of Harmonisation, said that compared to 2011 military vehicles (2706), their number has fallen last year (1127).
Mr Park said that the main factors are stronger border controls between North Korea and China and a larger number of traffickers.
Pyongyang has made no public comments.
A large number of North-Fishers have been offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul magazine, more than 30 000 North Koreans have been crossing the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most escapes through China, which has the longest state border with North Korea, and which is easier to overcome than a heavily protected demilitarized area between two Koreas.
China takes troops as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often sends them back to their homeland by force.
The relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the heads of the two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the abolition of nuclear weapons that have stopped.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-uni in Singapore, where they generally promised to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US of a lack of progress in sanctions.
"Untrustably the United States of America, our country does not have security security, and in such circumstances we do not agree in any way to unilaterally dearm ourselves first," said Mr Ri, in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that the man was unfit as Judge of the Supreme Court.
The opposition leader of the Chamber of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, appointed Brett Kavanaugh as the “hysterical” candidate for the Supreme Court and said that the man was unable to serve as the judge of the Supreme Court.
Pelosii delivered an opinion on Saturday’s interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I inevitably noted that if a woman had been so present, she would have been hysterical," said Pelosi about her reaction to the testimony given before the Senate Legal Committee on Kavanaugh Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotionally that he had sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both teenagers were.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening remarks, describing his family and high school years, he almost screamed from time to time, and sometimes remained speechless.
He also explicitly condemned the members of the Democratic Party in the Committee, calling the accusations against him of the loss of the Presidential elections in Hillary Clinton in 2016 as organised "grotes and a coordinated murder of reputation" by angry liberals.
According to Pelosi, he believes that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that a man was not qualified as Judge of the Supreme Court because it showed that he was inclined against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with these proclamations and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats,” he said.
The fears remained modest when asked whether he was trying to withdraw Kavanaugh from office if the Democrats were to receive a majority in the Chamber of Representatives.
"I say so much – if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he doesn't just fit as a Supreme Court judge, but he doesn't fit into the court where he's currently working," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is now a court of appeal in the Columbia District.
He added that he was concerned, as a Democrat, about decisions against Kavanaugh’s possible Affordable Care Act (health Cares Act — Translator’s Note) or Roe v Wade (abortion’s legal predecessor — translator’s Comment) because he is considered to be a conservative judge.
At his confirmation session, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court rulings.
“It is not really a time when a hysterical tilted person could become a judge and expect us to say, ‘Isn't it nice?’ said Pelosi.
And women have to wear it.
It's a fair choice of words, months and years of excessive anger, and he can't get away with it without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” said Ms Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do I?"
He continued: “I received help from a woman who was somewhere in the manager; she said that she also cried how angry she got, but she worked out a method that consisted of her being angry and started crying, and she said to someone she was talking to, "You might think I'm crying because I'm sad.
I'm angry."
And he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are partially accepted as an output of rage because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories is an early job with a majority of men in the office, where I once found myself inexplicable with rage when an older woman — a strict leader who I had always feared — grabbed me and dragged me to the stairwell.
"Don't ever show them crying," he told me.
“They don’t know you’re mad.
They think you're sad, and that gives them satisfaction."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Party Congressman Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in a man's presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart missed a yacht called Monkey Business with an extramarital love story and ended the campaign, Schroeder thought that there was no reason why he should not think of running as president himself.
“This was not a well-designed decision,” he told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were seven candidates and the last thing they needed was someone else joining."
Someone said it's like "The Snow White and the Seven Knife Boys."
Since the campaign was over, he was late to raise money, and he promised not to run if he didn't make two million dollars.
It was a hopeless battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters who donated $1,000 to men gave him only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he thought.
When he gave a speech stating that he did not launch the official campaign, feelings — gratitude to the people who supported him — became irritable against a system that made it difficult for him to turn to voters instead of money and delegates, and hatred for sexism — so overcome that he had tears in his throat.
“You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” recalled Schroeder’s reaction to the press.
“I could have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they wrote on my gravestone.
"He cried?"
How the US-China Trade War Can Be Useful for Beijing
The openings of the trade war between the US and China were curious, and although the battle is far from over, according to experts, the interstate gap can be useful for Beijing in the long term.
This year, President Donald Trump of the United States issued the first warning shot by imposing taxes on essential Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important evolution took place this week with new tariffs for USD 200 billion ( GBP 150 billion) in goods, substantially imposing taxes on half of the goods from China to the USA.
Beijing has responded the same every time, with the latest tariffs ranging from five to ten percent to 60 billion dollars for American goods.
China has promised to let the US answer by shot, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to be blinking soon.
Getting back to Washington would mean giving in to demands, but publicly worshiping the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that, if Beijing's cards are correctly displayed, the trade war with the US can support China in the long term by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions leading to the loss of economic control in another country is in fact far more dangerous than bystanders have previously admitted,” said researcher Abigail Grace, who focuses on research into Asia at the Center for New American Security.
According to the Foreign Minister, Syria is ready to return to refugees
According to Syria, the country is ready for voluntary return of refugees and is asking for the reconstruction of the country after more than seven years of war.
When speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country would improve.
"The situation on national territory is now more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to restore normality in the regions destroyed by terrorists.
Now there are all the conditions under which refugees who have left the country because of terrorism and because of the unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods can voluntarily return to the country.
According to the United Nations forecast, 5.5 million Syrians have fled from the country since the start of the war in 2011.
A further six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would gladly accept aid to rebuild a ruined country.
At the same time, he stressed that the State would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the resurrection.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup Competitions by defeating the US Team's final result of 16.5 vs 10.5 at the Le Golf National Golf Course near Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and Ryder has not won the cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe was once again crowned when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team became 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
Phil Mickelson, a star of the United States throughout the tournament, hit par-3 in 16 waters, giving the victory to Francesco Molinar.
The Italian golfer Molinar shined in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players who have won the tournament in the current 1979 format 5 : 0 : 0.
Jordan Spieth, the American, was made by 5+4 the lowest Dane Thorbjorn Olesen on the European team.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, followed Ian Poulter with 2 and 1 English, who could have been the last of the Ryder Cup.
The eight Ryder Cup Veterans, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most successful European of all time.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t hold back.
It's been a hard year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy we got the cup back.
It's a team spirit, and I'm glad I could help," said the emotional Garcia for Europe's victory.
He will pass the torch on to a fellow Jon Rahm, who won a single US golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 on Sunday.
“I feel extraordinaryly proud that I won Tiger Woods – I grew up looking up to him,” said Rahm, a 23-year-old.
Woods lost all his four fights in France and now he's written down a career in Ryder's cup competition 13 : 21 : 3.
Strange statistics for one of the best players of all time who's won the 14 titles of the tournament, missing only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team spent the entire weekend finding fairways; the exception was Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
After the team’s disappointment, US Captain Jim Furyk said: “I’m proud of the guys, they were cute.
There was a moment this morning when we put pressure on Europeans.
We fought them.
A hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players did a very good job.
Let's get together, work with America's PGA and our Ryder Cup Competitions Committee and move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to lift the hat.
We were better played."
New information on flowering: concentration decreased in Pinella, Manatees and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission (FWC) shows a general decrease in the concentration of booming algae in the Gulf of Tampa.
