The city of Juankoski joins the city of Kuopio at the beginning of 2017.
The Kuopio City Council unanimously approved the alliance on Monday.
The Juankoski City Council approved the alliance last week.
The municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved in the settlement, but its council decided that Tuusniemi would continue to be independent.
Kuopio and Juankoski decide separately on the implementation of the following municipalities.
The following municipal elections will be held in 2016.
After Juankoski joined, the population of Kuopio is about 111,000.

Putin: Ukrainian troops shoot civilians
On Monday, President Putin accused Kiev of refusing to have direct political discussions with the separatists in Eastern Ukraine.
At the moment, Kiev's leadership does not want to carry out an essential political debate with the eastern part of its country, and Putin said according to Itar-Tass.
He also said that Russian-minded separatists, who are said to be assisted by the Russian army, tried to push Ukrainian troops further away from their current positions, where Putin said that Ukrainian army forces were shooting civilians.
The goal of the militia fighters is to push out these armed forces and their artillery so that they do not have the opportunity to shoot the people in the area, Putin said.
The event took place on Fridays and Saturdays at the Ryrmi Repair Station.
It surprised me that the crowd came from the very beginning of the night.
Over the last two days, there were visitors expected, says Promotor Tom Kangas.
The Hypop Festival was held for the third time in the Wall River.
Next year again.
We're still going to be hip-festers, which means there's no pops on the list, Kangas assures us.
In Finland, on Tuesday, a law will enter into force that will limit the acquisition of substances suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, individuals will have to apply to the Police Department for permission to buy or hold substances or mixtures that could be used as a ‘premium’ for explosives.
Such substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate and mixtures containing them, if the specified concentration levels are exceeded.
Hydrogen peroxide, for example, is present in cleaning and washing agents, but concentrations do not generally exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane is used, for example, in the acceleration drive.
However, starting materials obtained before the entry into force of the Act may be held and used until 2 March 2016.

In accordance with the judgment of the Judge, Lady Rae, the trial will be held in Edinburgh on 17 November before the Supreme Court.
Valioliiga: Super Raheem Gleazy - Mario remained in the shadow - Valioliiga - Evening Sanomat
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling showed again why he is considered to be the hope for the future of English football.
On Sunday, White Hart Lane had an electronic atmosphere when the strengthened Mario Balotelli arrived at Tottenham.
The first appearance of Super Mario was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian working in the field with a different attitude from that of Manchester City.
The ballet was still a long way from its peak.
The Italians lost three high - quality goals and fed only half of their sixteen feeds to their own team.
Half-porters who have already accepted the player will expect a better one in the future.
The Liverpool-manger Brendan Rodgers planted Balotelli in the role of Luis Suarez as the second attacker of the team alongside Daniel Sturridge.
Instead of Balotelli, the team was starred by the tip of the middle field diamond, Raheem Sterling, who scored the 3-0 victory past the important opening goal of Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19 doesn't just shine.
The Balotellia is 20 cents shorter than the fish in the water.
The feature is not common for a player who thanks at best for about 34 kilometers an hour.
The Rodgers also deserves great thanks for Sterling's development.
After the match, the Northern Irishman told us how Liverpool has systematically developed a more comprehensive player from Wembley's Northwest chair.

I look forward to our future cooperation," he says.
Administrations of employees' organisations in the field of pension negotiations - Domestic - Regions - News - Karjalainen
A new pace is being sought for the negotiations on pensions today in connection with the own meetings of the social partners.
The management of SAK, Akava and SSTK will address the negotiating situation in the morning.
After that, the actual negotiations on pensions are scheduled to continue.
The social partners have, among other things, been affected by the dispute that retirement age should be linked to life expectancy.
Organisations have promised a career solution by the autumn, but according to the latest estimate it would occur this week.
It's a confessional tube.
Rovaniemin women's volleyball league team Woman Volley tripped with the league player Vampula Sportsmen in the finals of the training tournament in Pharjapua on Sunday.
The vampire turned to five one stretched match for a 3-2 win.
The last batch of WoVo lost 15-11.
The neighbor was one step ahead the whole time.
The fight was good, but in the defense and passport game Vampula was a little better, saw the coach of WoVo Teemu Mäkikyro.
The six of WoVo was so shaky that the 190-inch American-centre Jennifer Keddy was stuck on the back side.
As the senators, Sara Niemi played.
Karoliina Kyllönen was capable of playing despite his thumbs and formed the most powerful combination of Johanna Pekkarinen and WoVo.
Jenna Keskläki, who started as a hacker, was allowed to make room for Jana Jaudzem for the last 1.5 rounds.
The best part of the vampire was a skilled Russian pastor and a libero Hillael Hämäläinen, whom WoVo toured as much as possible.
WoVo’s preparation for the league will continue next weekend when Hämeenlinna’s HPK comes to the training camp for Rovaniemi.
On Saturday, the team will meet at the "trader" at 6 p.m. in an official training game.
On Sunday, we'll meet again at the Sports College.
Lidl takes wild numbers in Finland
During the financial year ending at the end of February, the company's sales turnover increased by almost 25 per cent to almost EUR 1.2 billion.
The company released their results on Monday.
Lidl now has 142 stores in Finland, and enlargement is planned to continue.
Lidl also reported that for the last financial year, he paid nearly EUR 14 million in taxes to Finland.
Lidl Finland belongs to the German Lidl Group.
The company has more than 4,200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer is more common due to delayed diagnosis and access to treatment in sparsely populated areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have published a video in honor of her mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
In Australia, rural women are at greater risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
In 2005, researchers reviewed the patient data of over 1,100 Australian women with ovarian cancer diagnosis and found that only 35 percent of women, or over five years after diagnosis.
The main researcher Susan Jordan of the Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
SURVEILLANCE: New medicines may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers went through women’s health history for seven years.
According to doctor Susan Jordan, the age of a woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, previous diseases and socio-economic status also affected the possibility of survival.
In older women and when cancer was more widespread, the probability of survival at the time of diagnosis was the lowest.
Women living in rarely populated and remote areas died 20% more likely during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not aim to find out why women living outside the city are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers possible reasons for delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment.
"The specialist doctors in gynecological oncology treat this disease best, and their reception is mostly located in large cities," Jordan says.
Although remote treatment is becoming more widespread and the importance of distance is diminishing, the researcher also proposes to increase the mobility of doctors in order to enable specialist doctors to care for patients closer to their home, and programmes to support patients who are far from home.
According to a study by Dr Jordan, the long-term survival rate of women with ovarian cancer is poor, regardless of their geographical location, which highlights the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programmes.
The study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old family mother in Gold Coast, found malignant ovarian cancer.
The town of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen the parking lot in the parking lot, which is located next to the hotel Pohjanhovi.
On Monday, the City Government decided that the proposal for a status plan for the Park of Friendship and its immediate surroundings would be placed on the public service point Osviitta.
The proposal for a formula is requested from the Environment Board and the Lapland Ely Centre.
With the help of a ramp change, the city wants to make it possible to continue its tourism-related motor-rolling activity in the area.
A park area is planned to be set up, which includes the area between the present park of friendship and the river.
During the period 15 November to 30 April, a maximum of 200 snowmobiles will be available on site.
Refuelling points may also be placed in a given section of the area.
Service traffic is also allowed in the new park area.
The town of Rovaniemi has rented the area of the Locality Park for safari companies to use snowmobiles during the winter.
The lease agreement was last renewed in spring 2014 and is valid until spring 2018.
Kelkkaparking and change of design have also raised the resistance of loud voices.
The inhabitants of the neighbourhood have been sore about both voice and concern about emissions.
However, the area's emissions have been investigated and studies have not revealed any findings beyond the reference values.
The renewed fleet is even more low-emission than in the past.
The park of friendship as a parking lot also supports the fact that if the place of departure were to be moved further, the safari customers of the hotel would have to transport safari to their places of departure by buses estimated to be 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the area and the surroundings of the park of friendship are also sufficiently large for the people of the city, better than the places presented as replacement destinations, such as the entrance to the eastern boat platform on the Ounas River bridges.
The park of friendship is a good thing for its location, even though in the future the activities can expand, for example, to the area of Ounaspaviljong.
The consolidation of parking activities is part of the urban strategy adopted by the City Council of Rovaniemi, according to which the goal of the city is, among other things, to create a good framework for business activities by providing adequate quality areas for places that are logistically and functionally advantageous.
The park of friendship is also marked as the starting point for snowmobiles in the central general, which has not yet gained legal power.
The fall of owner-occupied dwellings is seen in garden shops
The reduction in the number of residents, especially in a group of people under 35, may lead to a decrease in the turnover of garden shops by tens of millions, when today's young consumers reach for their age the "target group" of garden sales.
According to the Financial Times report, tenants use only 55% of the amount of money used by owners for gardening.
The study also revealed that more and more people live in very-cityd dwellings without gardens, and that the size of the garden is falling as the front yard is increasingly covered as a parking place. These factors also threaten the garden sector, which is estimated at about 5 billion pounds per year.
In the large London area, housing ownership has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, where garden products are spent least on households throughout the country.
However, according to the HTA and the British Gardens Association (RHS), the increase in renting housing or the decrease in the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
The leading horticultural advice from RHS, Guy Barter, says that "for example, plants grown in transferable growing vessels are particularly popular among tenants, as such growing vessels may be included if necessary".
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were a booming period for reselling in the horticultural sector, as housing ownership and wealth increased from the end of the 80s to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that this year, thanks to better weather conditions, trade will get worse than last year's weather in March and April.
Turkey is questioning the US diplomat for a spy report.
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has invited the country's most experienced US diplomat to report on the U.S. and British espionage in Turkey.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Bulent, the US Embassy's administrator and the Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the website The Intercept have written that documents leaked by the former analyst Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency (NSA) of the US National Security Agency reveal that Turkey has been the main spying target for U.S. and UK intelligence services.
According to the Turkish news offices, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reduced the meaning of the report, saying that all major countries have been spying on each other.
The previous report on the spying of the German primary intelligence service in Ankara has produced a more angry reaction in the Turkish Government.
Cannes winner Croze performs in a new Finnish film
The Canadian actor Marie-Josée Croze, who appeared in several success films, is attached to the female main part of the new Finnish film.
Croze plays in the film of director Mikko Kuparise 2 nights in the morning, whose descriptions start this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the Best Women's Award for Cannes Film Festival in 2003 for his role in the Barbarian Invasion.
He's been in a film by Steven Spielberg in Munich and Julian Schnabel in the butterfly glass bowl.
Two nights to the morning - the man's main film is Mikko Nousiainen.
The film will be available for Finland's first night in September 2015.
Chief of Police of Mallorca Magaluf, accused of corruption
Those who submitted the case provided evidence of the blackmail committed by the police and the officials of the Calvià City Government at the Office of the General Prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday.
Calvià, a police chief on the island of Mallorca, has been arrested as a result of charges of corruption against the shop owners and bar owners of the Magaluf area known for the wet celebration.
Captain José Antonio Navarro was put in an incarceration after several business owners of the Punta Ballena Street filed charges of corruption against him. The majority of the Magaluf bars and nightclubs are located on the Punta Ballena Street.
According to the daily newspaper Mallorca Diario published on the Internet, the parties who presented the case provided evidence of blackmail by police and Calvià city government officials in the Mallorca Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The Spanish National Guard arrested two other local police officers in connection with corruption charges, and they are to be questioned by the judge together with Navarro.
ABC, a daily newspaper published in the whole country, wrote about the partiality of the angry authorities of the nightclub owners, which significantly complicated their business.
"There is no more money in this case, but survival," said one businessman to the court.
You're not destroying our business.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in several countries in the headlines of the magazines this summer, when the YouTube video spread online, where an 18-year-old British holidayer was having oral sex with 24 men during the so-called pub crackl.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to control the drunk and uncontrolled use of Magaluf’s holidayers by reducing the number of participants in the notorious, alcoholic pub crackles.
In addition, the Playhouse Night Club, where the oral sex video was filmed, was closed for a year, and a fine of EUR 55 000 was imposed on the owner of the nightclub and the organiser of the pub crawl.
In particular, among young British tourists, its recommendation at the tourist destination of Mageluf has also become popular with the ‘balconing’ trend, which has caused several accidents caused by alcohol consumption, when people have jumped from balcony to balcony to pool or balcony.
The children of Israel return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of children from Israel returned to school in the Gaza Strip on Monday after spending a summer in bomb shelters when rockets and grenades bombed their communities in the 50 - day war between Israel and Hamas, and schools remained closed as the region recovered from battles.
The opening of schools brought joy and tension in the communities of southern Israel bombed by rockets, but the signs of battle remain visible.
In Ashdod, South, the Pashosh Day Home, the workers removed the traces of the fragments from the walls and slides before the children arrived at the day-care centre.
"We're a little scared, but also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbuts called Saad, Israeli community, and works as an English teacher at the city school.
Many children living in this area urgently need routines.
In the opinion of Bart's 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, going back to school in a long time feels a little strange.
"We've had a difficult time at times when we didn't leave home anywhere," he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited Kibbbuts near the Gaza border to provide his support.
Before the start of last week's ceasefire, thousands of inhabitants of communities such as Saati's border area had stayed indoors or left their homes for safest regions beyond Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many of the inhabitants of the Nahal Oz community near the Gaza front are suspicious of the return of the Palestinian grenade after the death of a 4-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Department of Education, about ten families had not returned yet.
For the time being, the children of these families have been placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, near the Gaza border in a city that was subject to heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that "the education and safety of children would be provided".
Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire for the time being last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately interrupted the fight, but it did not bring a solution to many key issues, such as Hamas's call for the removal of the Israeli and Egyptian archipelago and the re-opening of Gazan air and sea roads.
Israel wants to take Hamas's weapons off and return the body of two Israeli soldiers who have fallen in war.
In Egypt, a new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month.
According to the Palestinian and UN estimates, over 2 100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of which were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of the dead, according to which at least half of the dead were soldiers, although it had no lasting evidence of this.
On the side of Israel, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including Thai workers.
Hamas and other Gazan soldiers fired 4 591 rockets and grenades in the Israeli cities mostly in the south.
The Israeli army, on the other hand, carried out over 5,000 air strikes and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250 000 people fled for protection to more than 100 UN schools that had been transformed into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people were still protected and as the battles continued, school officials moved the school to the beginning of the previous week.
"I hope that the school will open soon and we will get back to school, just as the other children in the world and just as the Jewish children," said the 13-year-old Mohammed Amara, who lives in a school in Gaza City.
According to the commonly used meter, housing prices have risen to the greatest in seven years during the winter months of Australia.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing price index in the capital of Australia rose by 1.1 per cent in August, showing RP’s data on Monday.
With the rise in summer, July and August, prices increased by 4.2 per cent, i.e. more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9 per cent, which is more than twice as high as in the 12 months preceding August 2013, but prices have not risen steadily throughout the country.
According to RP Data Research Director Tim Lawless, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the price increase.
RP Data shows that housing prices rose by 16.1 per cent in Sydney and in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent in the previous year.
The housing markets in Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin are the next highest; the average price increase is from five to six per cent.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose only by 1.4 per cent per year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring start in Australia increases the number of dwellings sold over the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
"In view of the increase in the sales of dwellings to be auctioned, the generally lively rate of sales and the continuing low interest rate level, it is likely that the price of housing will continue to increase over the next three months", Lawless says.
The new Gösta Museum has drawn record audiences to Mäntta
The new museum and visual arts have attracted record audiences this summer to Mänttä.
By the end of August, more than 70,000 visitors have visited the Serlachius Art Museum.
The new Gösta Museum was opened in June and there have been classic works of pop art from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
Mäntta's art weeks once again told us that he had taken a visitor record on Monday, when 14 500 interested people visited the Wait-At this summer.
These figures are not used.
People have been torn from doors and windows," says director Pauli Sivonen of Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the number of visitors to the Serlachius Museums will be approaching 100 thousand this year.
In previous years, there have been some 40,000 visitors.
In Mäntta-Vilppula, middle of Tampere and Jyväskylä, there are about 11 000 inhabitants.
Sivonen, the museum director, reminds us that the new museums are always at the opening of phenomena.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
It is therefore hoped that the period of art will continue far beyond summer.
New exhibitions will be opened at the Art Museum in the autumn.
Police are investigating four thefts in Kajaan in the last few days.
On Sunday night, there was a breach of the window of business property at the North Bank.
Whoever did this had got a small amount of money from the cashier.
Between Thursday and Monday, the Deepwater Street had stolen fuel from the truck tank.
The boat was taken between Sunday and Monday from the boatport of Petäisnika and the boat with its rear engines.
The rowboat was a fishboard sign for the outside of the light and from the inside of the yellow.
On the inside strip, it read "OIVA" on the back of the beak.
A couple of suspects already had time to catch the police.
On Sunday night, the Tikkapuron Road broke into business property.
The police dog got a lead, and a 20-year-old Palthamom man was found hiding in the woods under a tree.
On Monday, the police captured another man from Paltamo, who is also suspected of having committed the same break-in.
The missing amphetamine brought a murder charge in Kajaan.
The disappearance of less than ten grams of amphetamines brought a murder charge to a Kajaan man born in 1977.
According to the D.A., a man had gone to the apartment with his stepdaughter and another man and shot with a shotgun the owner of an apartment he suspected to export drugs, a 34-year-old kajaan woman.
The defendant dismissed the charge and claimed to have been involved with another man as a shooter.
The case became known to the police when the police force stopped a passenger car where the company was burning clothes used for blood work.
In addition to the burnt clothes, we found a cut-off shotgun in the car.
The district court will judge the case later.
August was rarely warm in many places.
According to the Department of Air Science, once every ten years, the average number of months is as warm as August as it is.
The statistics from the AME show that the average temperature in the whole country was higher than usual.
Most of the country had an deviation from one to two degrees.
Due to the heat of July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature of the whole summer was measured at the first week of August in Pori, where the meter showed a temperature of 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says my father never hugged me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born to a family of seven children from Jamaica in Dudley, England, in 1958.
Henry's father worked at the factory and died when Henry was 19.
Henry is currently practicing for Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, which is partly based on his father's imaginary conversation and developed on the basis of a series of Radio 4 channels.
The sound track is a mix of rggata and dew on the upbeat.
Henry's been through painful childhood memories.
He has been in therapy several times since his mother died, and he is concerned about his relationship with his father.
It was very difficult to read my father.
His face was never visible, only the voice said, "Stop the noise."
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I'm looking at the cricket now.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, visited the pub with my father and discussed, for example, the shape of beer or the beauty of a cocktail.
I never talked to him about such things.
For me most of my life, he was the smileless man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal fuse in Dudley, and this gave him an idea of what his father’s life must have been like, although working conditions are better today than at the time.
The melting plants are slightly brighter today, but they are practically dark, smoked, Labyrinth - shaped depths, where flames, smoke, and nappy are pouring into the mind of the shekel.
The father used to go to the bath and only to the ground in the tub, and slowly he began to sing to himself when he washed off the molten dirt.
As I walked around the melting house, I realized that he had worked for years to get us food at the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry’s childhood lacked the closeness offered by his parents.
My father never hugged me, and he never said he loved me.
Only when my mother started to get sick a little before she died did we start to repeat to each other that we loved each other.
Henry has Billie's daughter Dawn French, and through his own child, he's been able to share the love he had when he was a child.
Do you have to keep saying "I love you"?
Stop hugging!
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn French.
Why aren't we friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry is still a good friend with French, whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn's a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to Mom's death.
When I started suffering from excessive overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to make a full translation.
After that, I began to exercise a lot, and I also had to start a heavy diet to reduce the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And boring.
Nobody likes eating carrots.
Henry’s well-known short beard may reflect his change during career development.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from critics about his role as Othello, he is embedded in the doing of the theatre.
The next item was the Comedy of Errors and August Wilson's Fences ("Aids").
Making a theatre offers a different experience than the sitcoms and comedy that Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry only started when he was a 16-year-old factory employee.
One of the dishes found him doing some imitations on the stage and contacted the New Faces.
Henry's TV career started in the middle of the '70s. "I was the only black impersonator and comedian on TV for a long time," he says.
Henry learned how to work.
I was supposed to grow up in the light bowl of publicity, I had to learn how to produce jokes from the sliders in 1975–1985, while I was on TV and I was living in a star. It was a difficult time.
Lenny New Faces in 1975
Henry's manager had stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program where the people appeared black in makeup, so Henry ended up in a comedian program for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I'd never been involved in it, but I don't regret it.
Although my position was strange and gross, I was able to work on huge events and learn how to handle the audience.
However, "the award of British TV, a multi-annual favorite and a light entertainment program" was also "a glamorous barod of black people".
Henry worked in the second comedy series in the '80s, where both ruins were made and popular with the black British culture.
The Lenny Henry Show first episode was shown in 1984, and in the 90s Henry was known for his character as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
After the next decade Henry spent with commercials, documentarys, TV series and film parts, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv, he said to himself, "What are you going to do next, Len – now it looks like you're just riding in your seat or on the sidewalk".
Next up was the Radio 4 documentary series What's So Great About...?
The first part covered Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It was not really taught to us in school properly, and I think it belonged to the white middle class, which wears pantyhose and has money.
That's why the Shakespeare theme raised fear in me.
All the people we interviewed in the program – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me: "Test.
Don't give up the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
Why do we all love Shakespeare so much?
Henry made 20 letters about Othello's last speech for the document and he was sold.
I felt like I could do this.
It seemed almost like some part of me was missing earlier, and now it was put in place.
"This is what it's all about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your sentence, do a little background study.
So the exercise process was a tough one, and I read the play for months before it was done.
The play was finally a success.
Apparently, it was expected to fail, but it didn't exactly happen.
Soon thereafter, Henry played the main part in a comedy of errors.
Suddenly I played at the British National Theatre, and I couldn't really believe it.
At one point, I was thinking, "Oh, you've changed."
There were once technical problems in the play, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
"A little voice in my mind said to me, "You need to be able to do 10 minutes alone until the computer works again."
Instead, the assistant director announced that the proposal would continue as soon as the problem had been corrected.
I walked out of the screen, and some of me felt relieved.
It's not my duty,
I can leave it to the others to take care of.
"You're part of the play, stay in your role"
Henry "Fences" at the Duchess Theatre
Learning how to play "Fences" was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes people more sustainable.
This play was also well received, so it was like a sign from the gods; "This is what you must do."
Of course, this is what Henry says with a voice.
So I decided to stick around.
I truly love this job.
I love practice rooms.
However, Henry is basically still a comedian: small humorous babies continue to interrupt our conversation when he changes his impressions.
Stand-up is a matter of will, as it seems dangerous to receive immediate thanks from an unknown audience.
If you want it all the time, it could lead to a dead end.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theatre when it feels like it, but generally it doesn't inspire me the same way I used to.
I'm gonna ask Henry if he's gonna go on another stand-up tour.
It gives me real joy to sit with the director, who helps to shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the journey, and I do not believe that I will ever give up that feeling.
So this is his new birth?
I think so.
I like acting...
It's really funny.
The play keeps telling the story, and that's what I like to do.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya is going to draw up a register of officials to remove the ghost workers.
Kenya has started to draw up a biometric register of officials trying to remove the "mortgage workers" from the government's salary lists.
Employees who did not register within the next two weeks would no longer be paid, were declared in the Board’s press release.
The government doubts that thousands will continue to be paid after they have left office.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to put out corruption in the public sector after entering office in 2013.
According to an inspection carried out earlier this year, at least one million dollars per month was spent on the wages and other economic abuses of "mortgage workers".
The government has doubts that even after a person has died or left his official duties, the BBC’s Wanyama Chebusiri reports on the capital of Nairobi.
All officials are required to report themselves to the register at identification centres for the next few weeks in order to ensure that their data are stored in biometric form, as reported in the Government’s notice.
According to the press, all those who fail to do so without due cause are removed from the pay lists.
"This measure significantly rationalises the public sector, as it defines how many people really work in their duties, and it also clears wage lists at both levels of the government, which solves the problem of "mortgage workers", says Anne Waiguru, an official of the Ministry of Devotion and Planning.
The result of the period 2015 in Seinäjoki may remain at EUR 25.5 million in deficits, unless the city adapts its activities and expenditure in a tight economic situation.
On the basis of the current budget preparation, annual margins remain at around 9.4 million deficits.
Possible means of improvement were to compromise the scope and level of services, to buy services, to sell and grant assets and to increase tax and payment revenues.
The investment target of EUR 10 million is 8,5 million.
There is no relief in the situation of the municipalities.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient tax revenue growth, increased unemployment and a reduction of 5% in public contributions further undermine the outlook.
The purpose of the economic seminar is to find new ways of balancing the economy.
The City Government agrees that savings must be made.
The ship must be translated into the strategy's objective, says Kimmo Heinonen, President of the City Government.
The City Council returned the proposals submitted to the Management Board for preparation.
The proposals of the City Council will be based on the preparation of the budget at the Council's Economic Seminar in Frama on Monday, 8 September.
After the Council seminar, the draft budget will proceed to the City Council and to the City Council through a panel discussion.
Tens of Turkish police officers arrested as suspects against the "joon" government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey as suspects of 'ungovernmental plots', local media reports.
The police did not comment immediately.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, 14 senior police officers were arrested.
Some of the police were involved in corruption investigations last December involving government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey for the organisation of a large crime belt and the follow-up of telephones.
The Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, (who acted as Prime Minister during this period) said that police activities are part of the activities planned against him and others in power of Islamist leader Fethalah Gullen.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most Ukrainian schools opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This is a traditionally important day for families, and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatseyuk took his daughter to school.
At the same time he told the waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but he said that he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The first day of September was not celebrated at every school.
There is no peace throughout Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the whole huge Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexander Pastukhov, who presides at Slavianski School, where Yatsenyuk’s daughter goes, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally come back here and that children will have the kind of learning that will benefit them in the future.
The celebrations of the first day of school include traditionally children’s written shirts, balloons, and the giving of flowers to teachers.
According to the Texas Perrys, the twiite was unauthorized.
On Sunday evening, a abusive picture of the Democratic District Attorney was sent from the established Twitter account of the Texas Governor, Rick Perry, in the middle of hearing charges of abuse of power.
Tweetti was later removed, followed by a new Tweet where Perry swore that he had nothing to do with the picture.
The Tweet was sent unauthorizedly from my account.
"I don't accept the Tweet and I've deleted it", later publication said.
Perry's backups did not respond immediately to requests for clarification.
Although the Tweets were sent from Perry's confirmed Twitter account, it is unclear who published the photo.
The first twiit contained a depraved image of Travis' district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drinking the wheel in April 2013.
Perry blocked Lehmberg's funding when he refused to resign, which led to a large jury meeting in Austin this month when Perry was accused. Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
The title of Tweet was, "I don't always drive drunk, three times more than allowed, but when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing fingers."
I'm Texas's drunkest Democrat.
Lehmberg's office didn't lead the grand jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antion, who was ordered by the Republican Judge.
Perry has said he's innocent and called the charges a political plot.
His powerful judicial team has asked the judge responsible to dismiss the accusations and said that the law on which the governor who was most in office in Texas is accused is unclear, mirrored against the Constitution.
Perry cut off $7.5 million of state aid to the state's public inviolability service, which operates in Travis County and manages public sector charges when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision led the monitoring team on the left to file an official complaint on the matter.
Perry's confirmed Twitter account is regularly updated – and sometimes also famously.
After becoming the fifth place at the Iowa election meeting during his 2012 presidential election campaign, Perry threatened to stop playing the game by publishing on Twitter a picture of himself jogging on the lake with the text "Here I come, South Carolina!"
According to Berkeley, the housing market is "normal" again.
One of London's most important builders has warned that the housing market in south-eastern England has "repaired" to a normal level of activity.
The capital city of London has been struggling with huge demand and a sharp rise in prices while fearing a widespread credit bubble, which led the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
On Monday Tony Pidgley, the founder of the high-level builder, said that "from the beginning of the financial year, the market and the number of shops have returned to normal after the peak of 2013" and added that this has enabled a "stable operating environment".
During the recession on the London housing market, foreign investors made a lot of efforts towards the capital.
According to the land register, housing prices in the city rose by 18.5 per cent only in the previous year and thus exceeded the average of England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
The average sales prices of private, affordable and student buildings in Berkeley rose by around the fifth year, reaching a price increase of GBP 423,000 by the end of April.
However, reinforced pounds have made London's property less attractive in the last few months - some of the new real estate tax laws and political rhetoric on the possible 'cartan tax' before the general elections in May.
Last week, London's real estate agent Foxtons warned that the April mortgage loan report, which reported more stringent loan orders, would lead to lower market growth both in terms of sales volume and prices of real estate in the second half of the year.
On Monday, the latest information from the Bank of England showed that the number of loans accepted decreased in July, suggesting a declining housing market.
The real estate agent Hamptons International has calculated the 2015 forecast of London real estate prices by three per cent, as the index measuring the opinion of residential owners on prices has already begun to decline.
The number of shops built in the most expensive London regions in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has fallen in the quarter to the year before, says WA Ellis, real estate broker.
However, home demand in the capital is a blessing to Berkeley, which increased revenue from the properties sold to over 2.2 billion pounds.
Pidgley added that "the demand for a well-designed, right product for the best locations has remained stable and therefore sales have remained active".
In June, the company reported that it sold 3,742 new homes in the year preceding April, which is almost a third more than at the time of the pre-economic crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profits rose by 40 per cent year-on-year to GBP 380 million and turnover increased by 18 per cent to GBP 1.6 billion.
On Monday, before the annual meeting of the company, Pidgley stated that Berkeley’s annual earnings were in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual pre-tax profit is GBP 450 million.
Berkeley's stock sold evenly at the London Stock Exchange for £23.96 this afternoon.
Hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence's nude images into the network.
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards Awards.
A hacker who claims to hold hundreds of other stars leaked images from Oscar's actor Jennifer Lawrence on the web.
The Star Star representative confirmed that the images are genuine and condemned the hacker for "absolute privacy violation".
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes the stolen images of Jennifer Lawrence will be charged.
The images originally published on the 4chan image publication page were apparently in the wrong hands due to the weakness of Apple's iCloud storage system. It is claimed that there are dozens of other female stars on the list of hundreds of other hacks, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed.
It is not known how much of the images are authentic, though Scott Pilgrim versus the World star Winstead condemned hacking on Twitter.
"For those who watch pictures taken in the privacy of my and my husband's home years ago: I hope you have a good mind," Winstead did.
However, Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and "Victoriaus" series denied the authenticity of the images and called it "the so-called nude images of me are REFERENCES, don't you understand".
Let me put an end to this right away.
BuzzFeed reported late on Sunday that the representative of the pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the images of the star.
The only impression we have of Howard Jacobson's new novel, which is about love and the letter J.
They slipped, it pictured the best of what had happened, gradually dislodged themselves like a box of cardboard left out in the rain.
Only at times did she hear that she was too serious, too difficult, intense, too loose, and perhaps also a little bumpy.
That's when he shaked his hand.
He ID'd the stick.
Yeah, he was like a silo.
His last victim had been in the early stages of an affair which, however, had been promising; it seemed that this relationship could have facilitated his lonely boredom, and it might have brought into his life even some substance.
Ailin Solomons had unsatisfied hair and was a delicately delicate beauty with a joyful heart, from the northern village, which was even worse and further away from everything that Port Reuben had.
He had come to the south with the parent’s traveling companion, whom Kevern assumed to be his aunt. The aunt had inherited a house located in a humid but paradiseous valley, and the name of the valley was appropriately the Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house in years.
The pipes leaked, there were spiders in all the bathrooms, and the etans had left behind in the windows, keeping the whole place their own, and in the garden grew weeds that resembled giant cabbage heads.
The cabin was like children's rain, at the same time threatening and magical, garden full of secrets.
The author's story: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is nominated as the winner of the Booker Literature Award in 2014.
The nominations will be published next week.
Kevern had been sitting hand in hand with Ailinn on a broken terrace chair in the middle of a long hay, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening to a dissatisfied host through which the whole country heard calming music and calming news, when the sun - tanned feet of Ailinn brought to Kevern a song that had long since been sang by a long - forgotten black performer and which his father had often listened to at the bottom of the cabin’s sleeves.
Your leg's too big.
Such songs were basically too aggressive and were no longer played in the receiver.
They were not prohibited — nothing was actually prohibited — but no longer played.
They were meant to be forgotten, as was the word forgotten.
The public opinion reached what was not achieved by the law and the proclamation: just as people in the field of literature chose to read heroes' memories, cook books and romances, and in the case of music, they prefer Ballads.
As the day went wild, Kevern began to play a imaginative piano and sing a serenade to the big feet of Ailinn with a bold comical voice.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"It was the famous song of the jazz pianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, and he naturally lifted two fingers in front of his mouth.
So his father had always done before the letter "j" could run away from his lips.
It had begun as a game between her and her father when she was little.
His father told me he played the same game with his father.
If you let a word begin with your mouth, and you didn't remember to lift two fingers in front of your mouth, you'd have to pay for a penny.
It wasn't very funny at the time, and it wasn't even now.
He knew that was what was expected of him, that's all.
He was supposed to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn had never heard of such a thing.
Even Jazz had not been declared forbidden; it was not just played.
The improvisation was no longer in the fashion.
There was only room in life for one if-word.
When the song began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
That's the way things had happened to cleverness.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the cleverness of music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10 years, jazz music had become known to him through his father's half-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailin that Fats Waller was black.
Considering Ailinn’s age, it was likely that he did not remember the time when popular singers were not black.
There was no need for laws or for coercion either.
The famous society meant that each part of it was gratefully accepted — gratefully, that they had been spared by a happy trade — by the principle that each group did its natural things.
Based on their temperature and physical characteristics, people with African-Caribbean roots are the best suited to entertain and sports, so they sang and ran.
Originally, those from the continent of India were like naturally gifted with electrical equipment, so it was their job to ensure that every family had a working telephone used to handle matters.
Those who were left of the Polish community worked as pipesmen; the last Greeks broke the plates.
When it came to being from the Gulf of Persia and the Middle East, whose grandparents had not fled blatantly in fear of being accused of flaming flames and fearing that these flames would reach them next, they opened up restaurants that served the Labneh yogurt and burned the water pipe, and continued their lives as creatures and bored.
Let every one of them act according to their gifts.
Ailinn had only heard the ballades, and it was difficult for him to understand how the offensive words that Kevern had just sang could never have been dressed as music.
The music was used to express love.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe the Bigfoots.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion of security.
No word would pass through the sound insulation of giant cabbage leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to lift two fingers on his lips with Ailinn.
Alinn thought he was weird now.
"It was funny in Dad's mind," he said instead.
Alie's head was disbelief, and his hair covered Kevern's horizon.
There's nothing to see in the whole world except Ailin's huge, shattering hair soft.
That's all he wanted to see.
"If you say so," he said, but he didn't sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
Alie seemed really confused.
Are my legs that big?
He looked again.
Your legs aren't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too soon for him.
"You're attractive to me because of your thick ankles," he tried to fix it.
I'm twisted in that sense.
This wasn't helping.
He wanted it to sound funny.
Often, when he wanted to have fun, the effect was quite different, because he, like his father, missed the convincing charm with which to control the cruelty of a joke.
Maybe his father had meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite their gentle eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and rose from his terrace chair and at the same time poured the receiver and poured out the wine they had just had.
The wine had only been made from the back of the back, so that's not what he could use as the cause of the collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed to shake like palm tree leaves in a storm.
"And your thick head is the one that's delusionally attracted to me in you," he said...
Except I don't feel like it.
Kevern felt sorry for Ailinn, both because of his own, unnecessary cruel words and because of the fear that appeared in his eyes at the moment Ailin decided to stand up against him.
Did Ailin think he'd hit you?
He had never told Kevern about his life in the northern archipelago where he had grown, but Kevern was convinced that it had basically been the same as life here.
The same vast, sublime sea that waved against them.
The same confused men, although more pale and diabolical than their smuggler and disintegrating grandparents, walked from pub to pub, ready to beat every woman who dared to resist or tease them.
Fat head?
He'd still see a thick fist if he wasn't careful!
To suck first — kissing had become the most common word for erotic encounters between a man and a woman; to suck first and then attack the antidote for meaningless loveballads pumping out of the recipient.
Kevern said it was too much, because it was already hostile to absorb itself.
Alielin Solomons' body language told him to leave.
He pulled himself out of a terrace chair like an old man.
Ailin too felt exhausted, but the depth of Kevern’s grief surprised him.
This wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailin followed him — just as his traveling companion watched Kevern go through the upstairs window — a man who was himself the cause of his heavy life.
Adam's leaving the garden, he's thinking.
He felt sorry for Kevern and the men in general, although some of them had raised their hands against him to strike.
Turned his back, bowed, ashamed, beaten man who had lost all the will to fight — why did he feel that that vision was so familiar to him, even though he did not remember that he would have seen such a thing once before this moment?
When Ailin Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the recent event, intelligent and zealous 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked in a private establishment that measured the general opinion, made a brief study of the continuation of low and moderate violence in the countries where the reduction, or even the end, was likely to take account of the money and energy used to eradicate it.
"A lot has already been achieved, and much remains to be done," he wrote, "that can be compensated for thousands of years of fighting and most of the people who have won the natural aggression, especially in those abandoned and remote places, where, despite the church towers beyond shrubs, human beings are rarely known in time.
However, some things cannot be completely removed.
The higher the tower, the lower its desires.
The public cries about sentimental Ballads, babbles about the ill-fatted stories and swears on the name of the virtues of marriage and family life, but at the same time, old-fashioned cruelty keeps both rural communities and urban cohabitation areas in its persistent grip, and there is also evidence of a new form of evil-minded argument in homes, workplaces, streets and even play parks.
"You have a unfortunate tendency to dramatise", his director commented after reading the entire report.
I'd suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum gave his eyes to the ground.
And I have to ask myself, are you an atheist?
"I believe I don't have to answer that," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to appeal to its right not to answer personal questions.
Feminist?
Once again, quiet.
"I don't ask," Luther Rabinowitz said, "because I oppose atheism, lesbianism and feminism.
There are no prejudices in this job.
We are servants of unprejudiced society.
Although certain hypersensitivity is in itself completely acceptable and respectful, it may sometimes lead to distorted results, to the kind you have just presented to me.
Clearly, you have something against the church — and what you call cruelty or viciousness, others usually call natural energy and physical strength.
It is as if it happened yesterday, if it happened at all, that it destroys the fundamental vitality of the country.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind the head of Rabinowitz, the flamingo pink LED-light declared the instruction that Offow had already distributed to the country in the previous quarter or longer.
Smile to your neighbor, respect your partner, listen to the ballades, go to the music, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than quietness and singing the word is better than writing, but nothing overcomes love.
"I understand well what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum replied with a silent voice when he was sure that his director had finished, "and I just want to say that we are not as effective as we think we are.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will see that we are repeating the same mistakes that originally led to SIIHEN, which we have applied, which we have applied.
True, this time we do not pour out our hatred and distrust in others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed the pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You've gone too far," he said, "as you pictured as a "mistake" of the actions our grandparents may have done or not done.
You will also go too far when you say that they poured out their hatred and distrust upon others.
A person in your position should not be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past or defending the present, we do not speak of 'we' or 'they'.
There was no 'we' or 'other'.
It was chaos time, that's all we know about it.
"If we are absolutely honest, in that chaos," Esme dared to continue, "no group of society can say that they have behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done was good or evil.
That's when it was.
We do not need to talk about this any more – we agree on this.
And just as it is unnecessary to divide charges, there is no need to correct them, whether they are justified or not, and even if there is a way to do them.
But for what purpose is the past, if it is not learned from it --
There's a past so we can forget it.
If I may add one more thing--
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'm going through your report," he said, and said, "It was time for Esmen to leave.
The next day, when he went to work as usual, he was hit by a motorcyclist on the sidewalk, who was described by passers as "bad-minded and angry".
It's a coincidence.
Lesotho's army denies planning an attack; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Lesotho's army officials have denied to stage an attack on the government, saying that they are acting against a police officer suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying that the army had surrounded his official apartment and occupied government buildings in Maseru.
The Head of State and his family traveled to the neighbouring country of South Africa after telling them he was threatened with death.
Major Ntle Ntoi, the military's representative, denied the attack and said that the army responded to the threat of 'political fanatics'.
"Lesotho's Defence Forces took action on several intelligence that some police forces are trying to arm young party fanatics while they were ready to cause problems," he told the Voice of America news agency.
According to the President of the South African Government, Clayson Monyela, military action seemed like a revolutionary attempt.
"Although no party has claimed to have overthrown the government by force, the activities of the Lesotho Defence Forces appear to be in every way equivalent to the signs of the revolutionary attempt," he says.
According to the officials of the Lesotho army, soldiers return to their cashiers on Sunday, and the capital had a calm atmosphere.
In the meantime, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government in the absence of Thabane.
Thabane says he believes he's on the line because he's been trying to fight corruption.
There have been tensions in Lesotho since June, when Thabane interrupted the parliamentary sessions because of differences between the government of the great coalition.
He thus denies the government's power, although it is claimed otherwise.
Shop: Microsoft to set up a data centre in Uusimaa
The IT company Microsoft has set up a large data centre in Uusimaa, where it refuses to specify its location.
In a statement to Microsoft media, the company notes that it does not provide information on the location of all its data centres for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the centre is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It's an investment of hundreds of millions of dollars for Microsoft.
In public, Oulu or Kajan had previously been taken to the centre.
Microsoft completely stops its Oulu office, which takes the job from around 500 people.
All in all, Microsoft has announced that it will quit up to 1,050 jobs in Finland.
Camilla Lindfors, Microsoft’s Communication Director, tells the STT that the company does not comment on how many staff the new data centre employs.
The establishment of a data center in Uusimaa reported on Monday in the Kauplehti.
A man is charged with driving a girl into a traffic light.
A 78-year-old man is charged with driving a three-year-old girl in a traffic light in Fife.
Gordon Stewart is accused of being hit by a girl at a crossroads at the Pittenwee Eastern Neuk.
According to the prosecutors, Stewart was driving his Audi Q3 car discreetly and causing injuries to the girl.
Stewart, from Astruther, 78, denied the charges at the Dundeen Sheriff's office.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC ordered the trial to be held in January.
Four tips for better underwater images and videos
If you want to take pictures or videos underwater, you will have several different devices to choose from.
The most affordable option is a waterproof, compact point-and-shot camera, such as Nikon Coolpixel AW120 or action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both pay about $300.
I personally took these photos at a family party using several different cameras, each of which cost less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are some rules that you should follow.
Always check your device twice.
Even if you have a watertight camera, make sure that the battery and other parts of the camera are closed watertightly.
In addition, set the camera image settings to match the images or videos to be taken.
Some cameras or combinations of cameras and video cameras have a set to optimise the conditions under water.
In addition, before you jump into the water, make sure how deep your device can be.
Some cameras can only withstand the depth of 5 feet, others can withstand the depth of 50-60 feet.
See both common and watertight models in our shopping guide and in the reviews of digital cameras.
Take several pictures — many of them fail in some way.
The compact cameras have an LCD display that allows you to compile the image, while the action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see under water, and the compilation of the image can either succeed or fail.
So take a number of pictures.
If your camera also allows for gripping, which means taking several images at a time with different settings, use this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light will decrease significantly more deeply.
If possible, stay close to the surface while you are photographing the pool, lake or sea.
This gives you more colors; the deeper you go, the less colors you see.
Try to get close to the target.
This is important advice on the country's description, but even more important under water, because light conditions are scarce.
It is very important when an action camera is in use: these devices often have a fixed lens with a broad image angle, i.e. the screen needs to be close to the target in order to fill the whole image frame.
China does not allow Hong Kong to choose its leaders — protesters swear revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided that Hong Kong voters should not choose candidates for elections in 2017, despite the growing unrest of democratic reform.
The decision is likely to give a spark to the long-awaited protests of Hong Kong's business block, after the activists started planning and implementing demonstrations only hours after the decision was published.
The decision of the People's Congress in China gives practically Communists the power to remove all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
"This was to be expected, but it is still raging," says the President of the Democratic Party, legislator Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've lied to the Hong Kongs.
It is clear that we are working with an independent administration.
Li Fei, Deputy Secretary General of the People's Congress Committee of China, defended the Chinese regime, saying that a general candidate for the election of Hong Kong's leader would be too 'lost'.
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom handed over Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised to the residents of the region that it would be able to choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
According to the Chinese leaders, Sunday's decision was a democratic breakthrough, since it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but it also makes it clear that China wants to closely control the electoral process through the Nomination Committee, which is managed by Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be accepted.
In the summer before the decision, Hong Kong held some of the largest and most noticeable protests in the region for years.
The campaign for democracy was largely behind the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, which has been threatened by organisers to prevent the business block from operating if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong a genuine public right to vote.
On Sunday night, only hours after the decision was published, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in front of Hong Kong’s main administrative buildings.
In protest, the organisers of the movement announced that the movement would move to a new era of civil disobedience and would create protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they obviously did not provide details, fearing that this would lead to problems with the authorities.
In their communication published on the network, organisers said that the movement "responsible Occupy Central as the last means to be introduced only if there is no hope of dialogue and there is no other way".
We are very sorry to announce that today's last chance for dialogue has been lost and the takeover of the centre will take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday security was tight near the government's main buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, unrest is feeding many to feel that the inhabitants are slowly losing power in their city.
The wave from the continent has led to competition for products and services.
There is also a fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are disappearing under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some have criticised the Occupy Central movement because its demonstrations threaten Hong Kong’s vitality — the business world.
"The test that they are talking about can lead to major economic losses, depending on how many people take part in it and how long it takes," says legislator Regina Ip, who has long criticised the movement.
We do not want to worry that Hong Kong is skating away from us.
This is the image that would be bad for investing.
The media of the Chinese state has also put forward stories that Hong Kong's democratic activists are the grippings of the Western powers that are hurling the revolution."
This summer activists held an informal referendum on voting rights involving 780,000 people – more than one fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the biggest demonstrations in favour of democracy in the region.
The U.S. Prom tradition hits British universities: new students with private jets
In our enthusiasm, we respond to the demand by establishing the first class of luxury travel in Britain for today's students.
In addition to private aircraft, the company also offers other vehicles, such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, so that the customer can ensure the most memorable arrival to the university.
Stewart says there's also a security aspect in the service.
The service is the best option for students who would otherwise drag their property across the country to their extremes in loaded cars.
When combined with many VIF features (VIP-friends), we are ready to offer today's students as easy and high-quality transportation as possible to the university.
According to the company representative, no reservations have yet been made, as the service has just been set up, but added that "Students will start to make orders in the next few weeks".
The company believes that there is demand for the service, although most students pay £9 000 per year.
Today's students are very different in terms of their expectations and hopes than they started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now it is more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and the VIF is just the right way to do it.
However, the national student organisation criticises a service that is not realistic.
According to the vice-president of the university section of the organisation, Megan Dunn, "this service plan seems to be really far from the lives of a student majority".
Many of their studies this month are startling at the level of living costs, when the financial support available in the form of loans and grants is behind the enormous increase in basic living costs.

Bulgarian prison staff will hold a national protest
Hundreds of prison workers throughout Bulgaria expressed their views in front of the Ministry of Justice of the capital Sofia.
In a peaceful demonstration, they declared that they wanted back the old working provisions, which were recently amended.
The wage increases are also to be discussed with Mr Hristo Ivanov, interim Minister of Justice.

The protest of the prison workers' organisation is also expected to be related to members of the Trade Union for Workers of the Ministry of the Interior.
Basketball: Fans almost too much encouragement: Sasu Salin was fainting on the field
Basketball Sasu Salin was incarcerated today by Finland's victory.
He was able to forget his temper of the U.S. match and turned the blood of the other half of Ukraine with his stop-and-go solutions.
But Salin transferred all the glory to the Susifans and did it in style:
I was going to pass out on that field at the end, the encouragement was so great.
In the eyes, it was a fog. There was nothing.
That noise and the white public sea was almost too much for me.
Salin’s power moments contained nine surfaces in a fast pace, ball-scrapes, disks, and teaspoons everywhere in the place.
I don't know how it happened, but I got into a flow state that everything worked out.
They're just coming from somewhere else, and now it's so important, Sasu was glowing.
That's my role.
Do all that.
Now it's great to see that the rest of us got caught up in the plot.
It grabbed the whole gang.
Salin is a team cheer and spirit, so it is no wonder that his example brought the whole team to a flight that was too much for the big and hard-ass Ukrainian five.
Finland in the World Cup after 32 years of break: The previous ones were remembered by an unscrupulous jury game
Heikki Montonen (right) was the head coach of Finland at the Argentina World Cup in 1982.
It has been 32 years since the Finnish men's volleyball team last played in the World Cup.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was Finland's second coach and current player agent Jouni Parkkali as a general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember the tournament just yesterday: it was a hot match against France in the beginning.
"In that game, the court game was blatant," recalled Kosonen.
We had already won, and both teams had already set foot on the back line.
All of a sudden, the game continued.
We lost it two-three, and then the pasmas went crazy more," said Parkkali.
Finland played the lead coach at Heikki Montonen's command and finally ranked at 17.
Now Finland is again among the world's elections, while Poland's MM tournament will be on the way today.
Many things have changed radically in the international volleyball over the past 32 years.
Players' power values are about the same as before, but there is now more quality and skill.
The average length of players has also increased.
The game is faster," thought Parkkali.
But what happens in Poland?
The Finnish player's material has expanded and the burden can be shared.
I expect Finland to continue from the beginning.
Then you can get tight," assessed Kosonen.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savo were hit in a winning match against Tunisia.
The current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the World Cup.
Let's hope we're deceiving 17 seats.
South Korea and Tunisia should go down," said Parkkali.
Reino Kosonen was the second coach of the national team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Kökökö vented the Tunisian match.
The sauna and the evening charter at the Buenos Aires Marine Church were part of the National Team’s World Cup’s World Cup in 1982.
Kari Kalin (O.K.) spent time with her teammates.

Finnish tourists saved Cita from mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all thanks"
When the Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and his dogs got into trouble on Thursday in the mountains, Antti and Tuomo Soini offered brave help.
At the end of the week, Mikkelsen was looking for "International heroes" on Facebook to thank his helpers one more time.
Mikkelsen told me in a public Facebook update that a Cita dog who was with him on Thursday night hurt her ass.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk in a steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to attract it and pull it a little further, but its legs didn't just carry it, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, the help was not from the police, from a nearby hotel, or from passers.
In the dark of the night, the situation began to appear threatening.
Fortunately, there were two pilgrims who were willing to help — Antti Soini, a Tamperean and Tuomo, his father.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway at Galdhøpiggen and headed to their camp when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm compared to the situation.
We offered to help her with the dog, Antti Soini says in her message to Ilta-Sanom.
Soon there was also a German man with a hiking mattress.
From the mattress to Cita, a couple of people like that were put on by an injured dog.
The German man showed up shortly after us when we thought about what to do with the dog and carried the dog in his arms for a moment down the hill, says Soini.

The dog was able to be carried down with the help of a hiking mattress.
According to Soin, the performance was not physically heavy, but it was slow to carry in difficult lands.
After about an hour and a half, however, Cita was happily down.
After what happened, Mikkelsen was still on Facebook looking for "International heroes" to thank them one more time.
Sonics responded to him on Sunday, but the German man is apparently still unreachable.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen is happy.
If they hadn't helped me, we might not have come back.
I'd like to find these people because I feel like I didn't thank them enough.
They certainly don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all thanks and honor, I will forever be grateful to them.
On Monday night, the Soinis were already on their way home.
They had heard happy things from Mikkelsen: - Cita said she was better already!

Genetic abnormalities are often misdiagnosed
For years, the British woman was afraid of death because of a misdiagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth had only a few years left because he was diagnosed with another disease.
In fact he suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth’s disease (CMT). It means a group of inherited diseases that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to the Charity CMT UK Goodwill Organization, false diagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases, as they are known to be so few.
It is estimated that some 23 000 people in the UK suffer from CMT disease, which causes symptoms in motors, such as muscle weakness, difficult walking and toes.
The disease can also cause insensitive or pain, and it is incurable and progressive, meaning that the symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13, he thought he had Friedreich's ataxia (FA), which has a really bad survival rate.
Rodgers believed that he would be in a wheelchair before he turned 18, and he would die before he reached the age of 30.
Today, 51-year-old mother of two children says, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same thing as everybody else.
I fell every day, and I took longer than anyone else.
I could never skate or skate with other children, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently than others.
At the time of Rodgers' 13-year-old, he was subjected to several amphibian surgery to straighten his legs. In the course of the surgery, after leaving the doctor's room, he looked quickly at his research papers saying he was suffering from fa-disease.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I came home, I was checking out the medical records in the library and I wrote to the FA association," he says.
When they gave me information, I was shocked and panicky.
I thought I was going to be in a wheelchair by the age of 18 and die before I turned 25 and, in the meantime, I would slowly lose all my ability to function.
I went through this to myself and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by 17 years of age, he said that his walk had not deteriorated as much as he thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, "girl, honey, I don't think you have this disease because otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair."
I think you're suffering from something much less dangerous.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with a CMT disease.
"When I was explained what a CMT disease is, I thought I'd been delayed," he says.
Charity CMT UK is organising a CMT month to pay attention to the disease.

The mad-washed attacker of Hernandez's club on record
Valioliiga Society Hull invested the record amount of the club in the acquisition of Abel Hernandez, the country team of Uruguay.
Hernandez will exchange the Italian company in Hull from Palermo for £9.5 million, i.e. some €12 million.
The deal is three years old.
Last season, Hernandez hit 14 goals when Palermo won Serie B and entered the Italian main series.
In the country team of Uruguay, he's scored seven goals in 14 fights.
Last summer's World Cup, Hernandez came in two fights for a change to the field.
Abel is a fantastic acquisition and shows us how far we have come in a short time, said Hull's chief coach Steve Bruce.
On Monday, Hull also told me that he had acquired the country captain of Senegal from Mohammed Diamen West Ham.
Russia's space test failed - gays sent on a sexual trip died
The five small genes sent to Russia to increase to space are dead, says Roscosmos, the Russian Federation's Space Agency.
Gekos traveled with the Photo-M4 satellite for more than a month and a half.
The satellite returned to the country on Monday morning at Finnish time.
The purpose of the experiment was to examine the reproductive potential and use of gems in an unweighted state.
One male and four females participated in the experiment.
Although the test sounds extraordinary, its purpose was serious.
There is little knowledge of the effects of unweight on the development of eel eggs, for example.
The effects on genes can be used to anticipate the effects of non-weight loss on humans while staying in a longer state, illustrated by New Statesman in July.
According to Roscosmos, the time of death and the cause or cause of death of gays will be investigated.
According to the news agency, passengers who were baptized "sexegek" were frozen.
The surprise is also that fruit flies along the same Photo-M4 ride survived the journey and also gained post-growth growth.
France arrested a terrorist suspect at Nice Airport
France arrested a suspect in terrorism at Nice Airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected to have been recruiting a jihadist group in Syria.
The French authorities informed us on Sunday.
The authorities were able to track him after he had been lured by money to a 16-year-old girl to go to Syria.
The girl was to fly to Turkey and then cross the Syrian border.
The airline did not believe the girl’s explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but alerted the authorities.
The authorities contacted her father, who was completely ignorant of her daughter’s intentions and told the authorities that the family had no family in Turkey.
According to the authorities, he is from Chechnya, but now he lives in France.
The French intelligence authorities had followed the man's actions before.
In France, the authorities have been concerned that radicalising young people who are attracted to Iraq or Syria are also at risk of security for France.
The authorities estimate that, during the last conflict, some 800 French nationals or those on books in France have traveled to Syria, returned from them or are currently planning to leave for Syria.
Koponen: We have a good chance of winning
The wishes of the basketball team for the next round are at stake when Finland meets Ukraine today in its second match of the World Cup.
If the opening gap for the United States had been expected, Ukraine is one of the countries from which Finland should take the necessary profits.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I believe that we have good chances of winning, Petter Koponen predicts.
On Saturday, Ukraine won the competitions in its first match of 72-62 Dominican Republic.
The team is trained by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, in whose command Ukraine plays an aggressive basketball.
The key player in Ukraine is the game leader Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a world champion of a hundred meters three years ago.
Jeter threw 16 points against the Dominican Republic.
Pooh Jeter, quick guy, but we've been played against them before, and we need to get our standard defense fixed, Koponen said.
Hanno Mötölä promised that Finland would play better than last night's loss to the United States.
We need to find our own strengths again.
I can guarantee you there's a normal pack of wolves on the field, Mötölä said.
Alleged in Hollywood stars, they're spreading online, some of which have been confirmed to be real.
There are a number of nude images on the Internet that are claimed to be displaying well-known public figures.
Among other things, actor Jennifer Lawrence has been the victim of an "infectious" campaign.
The entertainment site TMZ has published an angry comment from Lawrence's representatives that seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a flagrant violation of privacy.
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes (on the Internet) the stolen images of Jennifer Lawrence will be prosecuted, the representatives are threatening.
According to TMZ, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the images that spread about her are genuine.
He had taken those pictures years ago with his husband.
When I know that those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what a terrible trouble was seen for this.
I feel sympathy for everyone who was the victim of hacking, he writes according to the website.
Instead, the actor Victoria Justice uses her own name as a fake.
There are also genuine or counterfeit naked images from Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
The Honka painter criticized his own people: "They don't work hard enough to get out of here."
The football club FC Honka is currently in the final position of the Veikkausliiga.
After the VPS game on Sunday, the painter Walter Viitalan's comments describe the mixed state of affairs of the club.
I haven't had a goalie coach in four months.
But everything needs to be adapted," Viitala said after the struggle that ended in 1-2.
Honka made a lot of defense-head mistakes, especially in the first half of the year.
The painter, Viitala, was not in the mood for a bad defense game.
Player traffic in Hong Kong has been busy this summer, and that is why the defenders in front of Vitala have shifted to a speedy pace.
With the player’s tournament, many young players have also gained opportunities that they may not even deserve.
"Some of us don't work hard enough to get out of here sometimes," Viitala cremated and didn't name any single player.
Honga's head coach, Shefki Kuqi, was somewhat in agreement with Vitus.
"I told certain players after the game that if you came to the training and games to have fun, and you think you're a gamer and you don't have to work, you're probably wrong on the team," Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of young people time to play.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of it, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also recalled that players cannot be expected to succeed immediately when players change constantly.
This period has not had the same composition twice in a row.
Especially in the head of defense, the people have changed.
That is the main reason why we are in this position," Kuqi said.
After the VPS killing, Honka is a series of jumbos, at the same time as TPS, the second last TPS.
There are seven more laps left for the cut-off, so there's still time for the suburbs to avoid falling into number one.
I've never dropped a team, and I'm not gonna drop a team now.
We will certainly not drop out of this series," the goalie Viitala threatened.
Lars von Trier taking decades of break after the TV series

Isabelle Roberts the moment before the accident
I tried to shut my mouth, but I couldn't, my jaw was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister noticed the same thing, and they started laughing, but I had to be thanked for first aid.
A 20-year-old Brittany who took part in the super-popular challenge on Tuesday was taken to a hospital where the jaw was put back in place.
The videotape has become an Internet sensation and has been distributed thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
View angle to wolf excavation (also): How can you explain the increase in the number of fans?
It was amazing today.
So said the basketball player Sakari Pehkonen in 1995, when Finland had played against France in the EM final tournament at the football hall of Athens Marouss.
He wasn't exaggerating.
I remember the game when I was there.
So were about 100 Finns who cried out to 20,000 viewers, otherwise the noise of empty halls.
What would Pehkonen have said 19 years later after the World Cup in Finland-Ukraine?
In Bilbao, there are 80 times as many as 100 Finnish fans.
The EM Championships in 1995 was a Finnish basketball season.
The men cleared their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, at the Russian fight in the Helsinki Sports House.
That victory opened the doors to the European cream.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people like Hanno Mötöl.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann took Mötölä to the final tournament team on the lime lines.
A solution that many disagreed with.
Now it can be said that Dettmann was far from wise, even though everything did not go according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball country team went deep.
A total of just over 100 Finns were present in Athens.
It includes journalists, players' relatives, Finnish basketball coaches and some fans.
There are journalists, relatives and trainers in Bilbao, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to inexplicable proportions.
I'm sure no one can say the exact number of Finnish rivals.
Estimates have moved between 7 500 and 10 000.
No matter what number between those two, it's an inconceivable amount.
Here's an explanation for sports sociologists.
In the global economy, businesses move across borders.
There is still an opportunity for sport to look at how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can visit our girls and our boys in the world, says Professor Hannu Itkonen of Gymnastics.
Surely there are Finns in both Spain and the World Cup in Poland who are looking for an experience.
It's a shared experience.
But it doesn't explain everything.
There's gotta be some attraction in sports, too.
Itkonen brings sport into popular culture.
It's a lower threshold to go to the sports fair than to Berlin to see art.
But without success, you can't get the masses started.
Let's go back to 1995.
That was when Chief Coach Dettmann challenged the basketball union and the players to play professionally in top sports.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed and the country team was set on foot.
The volleyballs made the same move a little earlier.
Now we both enjoy the fruits of the work.
As Itkonen says, both species have managed to produce their top sport, where holy Trinity works: sports media sponsors.
The public will also be interested.
And the media has taught me what such Carnival support is, Itkonen reminds me.
Can the types of ball play transfer this massive interest to the home series too?
On average, hundreds or a little over a thousand viewers play in basketball and volleyball.
Itkonen sees the question as a good one, and it does not necessarily give an answer that promises very good for the species.
The other school department believes interest is shifting.
The other is the one who doesn't want a sweet stomach full.
This group is ready for an experience trip to the World Cup, but their basic idea of home country series is not of dual interest.
There's a challenge for the people in the middle of the drug.
Security for the property of Bottaksn - nearly 1.5 hectares by the lake
Nastola is awarded by a formula driver at the beach house of Valtter Bottaks.
The municipal government unanimously approved the delivery of 1.4 hectares at its meeting on Monday.
In the future, a leisure apartment will be on the property.
The Nastola has been watching Bottaks' success since his days in the field.
He's being tried as an ambassador to market Lahti, Lahti District and Nastola.
The gift house is located in Koiskala, on the lake Kärkjärvi.
It has come into the ownership of the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate trade.
There are seven buildings in disaggregated condition, six of which will be decommissioned by the end of this year.
In the 1st Belgian competition, Bottas achieved his fourth prize ball this year.
He's on the fifth of the World Cup.
Bottas is a native Nastolic and has lived in Villaine, Finland.
He lives in England now, but he goes to Nastola every time he's free from formulas.
Bottas has visited upper secondary schools and youth facilities.
Design-intelligence clothes come but hardly for the poor.
It presents and tests them at the U.S. Open tennis competition in New York.
Ralph Lauren's smart shirt testers are the ballmen of the field, but also the amateur Marcus Giron, one of the top players in the university, holds one.
According to him, the shirt helps him follow his own development and regulate his recovery.
Silver sensors have been woven in their cord, from which the data is transmitted to the T-shirt and from there to the smartphone or to the tablet computer.
The sensors measure heart rate, breath rhythms, stress and steps.
Before the shirt is thrown into the washing machine, the engine acting as a central unit shall be removed.
The fashion house has not told us exactly the time to start selling the shirt, nor has it even hinted at the price, Tech Times newsed.
Raph Lauren is not the only company that invests in smart clothes.
Athos, California, has brought in an intelligent shirt and a smart-short.
They measure heart rate, breathing and muscle work.
The clothes cost $100 apiece and their required thumb-sized central unit costs two hundred dollars.
Red Orbit also wrote about the technologists.
Smart Way to Save in textbooks
The cost of university books in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so soon the second year of study Matt Schroeder came up with a smart way to save his expenses.
He developed a system in which students from later years quoted their books against nominal remuneration rather than selling them straight ahead.
"My mathematics book would normally have cost 180 dollars; I paid ten dollars for its use for the entire semester, and I paid for the sandwich," says a 19-year-old, Schroeder, a 19-year-old, studying at Covenant College in the state of Georgia.
Mr. Schroeder says that his books for the last semester would normally have cost 430 dollars.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the Board of Directors of the University, the average student spends over $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but the students have many ways to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online shops and creative approaches such as the Schroeder idea.
More and more students rent textbooks, allowing them to use the book throughout the semester and pay for it clearly less than the students buying the book.
According to the company Neebo Inc., which owns more than 250 campus books, the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
The sector statistics reveal that about a quarter of the books on university bookstores last spring were rental books," says Trevor Meyer, President of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are obtained from campus booksellers.
Here, the simplest way to save clear money.
Net transactions
In online stores, you can only get a new book by one third of the price it would cost at campus bookstore.
The 9th edition of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler's "Calculus" book is almost $290, but Chegg.com's online specialty books buys $239.99.
Buy Used
Used books are a good option if the reader does not interfere with other notes and worn-out looks.
For example, "Calculus" is available at the Chegg.com online shop for 93.49 dollars.
Brigham Young University's last year student Matt Casaday, 25 years old, says he bought a book "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" using Amazon.com for only 0.42 dollars.
The new book would have cost you $48.
Ingrid Bracey and other academics at the Amherst's College Without Walls University of Massachusetts recommend that students ask their professors if they can use previous editions for the course.
At times, reforms in the new edition are not essential to teaching.
In this case, you can only find an old edition with a fraction of the price you should pay for a new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular store for used books.
Renting
You should consider renting books if you take good care of them, remember to return them and do not need them after you have completed the course.
By renting you can save more than 80 per cent of the price of a new book.
For example, renting the book "Calculus" for the entire semester costs about $20.
Please refer to the rules of the lessee company, such as notes, the use and wear of the emphasis pen, for subsequent payments.
Renter, be careful: If you forget to return the book, the late payment may be higher than the book purchase price.
E-mails
Getting e-books instead of ordinary papers can also be a question.
At times, these books are rented and paid for the right of use of the e-book to its holder, such as Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg buys a book "Calculus" in an e-book for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, many literature students save most because several classics can now be downloaded for free, while science and technology books can be very expensive.
It is worth comparing the different sellers, which option will then be chosen.
Joe Gault, 29, which will soon start in Pepperdine's law firm, recommends using the ISBN number to determine the price, as it can make sure that you are looking for the right book.
Before you order online, make sure the book is in stock, Gault says.
He himself learned through this heel.
The delivery of the book he bought was left behind for four weeks, and he eventually had to get the book at full cost from the University Bookshop.
Tampere Legion Theatre meets 20 years

Almost double the number of people killed in the fires compared to last year
This year, nearly double the number of people killed in the fires compared to last year.
According to the media surveillance of the Finnish Centre for Rescue (Spek) 55 people have already died in the fires in 49 different fires.
At the same time last year, there were 31 fire deaths.
The majority of the dead, 36, have been men.
There have been 11 people over the age of 65.
According to the Institute's fire-death statistics, the worst situation was last in 2009, when 64 people had died in the fires by the end of August.
The majority of fire deaths occur in housing.
There have been 17 fire deaths in the apartment buildings, 21 in the private houses and 7 in the row houses and other small houses.
Spec reminds me of repeating home fire safety.
At least all home fire alarms should be ensured according to Spek.
In addition, everyone should check that the means of initial fire are easily available.
There must also be an accessible exit route from all the premises of the home.
Children should also be told what electrical equipment they can use when they are alone at home.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
The opponents of the NATO Summit protested at Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered at the city center of Newport for the anti - NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people met at the Cardiff City Hall, the so - called ‘ opposite summit’.
Stephen Fairlough followed events during the weekend and spoke to protestors who had arrived even from Belgium.
The young people were rescued by air from the blue mountains of Australia
Two teenage travelers were put to safety after being trapped in the Blue Mountains in the New South Wales region of Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went on a trip to Govets League on Sunday after noon to Blackhead.
His family were concerned about young people who had not returned home and called the police at 8:00 p.m.
A search party of local police and aiders was sent to search for young people, and the twin was found at about 2 p.m. near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had broken her knee, and the man had fallen and hit his head.
The police spent the night with a couple, and they were raised to safety on Monday morning.
Travelers were taken to the Blue Mountains Hospital on an ambulance, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdrew from Luhansk Airport
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Luhansk Airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, soldiers were ordered to retreat.
According to Ukraine, the paratrooper forces have been very much involved with Russian tanks in the field.
According to the military representative, the artillery fire of the opponent has been so precise that the shooter is likely to be Russian professional soldiers.
In the last 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
In the North-East Ukrainian Sea, the Ukrainian patrol ship that received armaments yesterday drowned in the morning, reports the Border Guard.
Eight marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The Border Guard didn't have any certainty as to where the ship was shot.
The Separatists already told us that they shot the ship yesterday in social media.
According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russia will not attack Ukraine.
However, Mr Lavrov insisted that Ukrainian forces should immediately withdraw from positions from which they could not fire civilians.
According to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the negotiations in Minsk today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE should bring about an immediate ceasefire without conditions.
Mr Lavrov also recalled that Russia should be responsible for any new economic sanctions.
Firstly, we will protect our own interests, our economy, our social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions from the actions of our partners, Lavrov threatened.
The rains caused Malmo and Copenhagen to flood
The streets flooded in Malmo and Copenhagen on Sunday, when the rains hit South Sweden and Denmark.
The floods cut off several roads, mixed traffic, and buried cars under.
On Sunday, the authorities estimated that it might take time for the flood to continue, even though the rain was forecast to stop on Monday.
The heavy rains came as a surprise to the Swedish authorities, and no weather warning was given in advance of the rains.
The meteorologist Ari Mustala, who is on-call at the Finnish Department of Weather Sciences, estimates that the rainland that was in trouble with the region was very local.
The rainland looks narrow and permanent.
No wonder it's been hard to predict.
French Socialists should "be silent and help France", Francois Hollande's main sponsor says
Mr Valls urged a deeply divided left-wing 'to show his feelings' towards a socialist president in difficulty, whose composition did not give the majority of the French people the approval of the new government.
The President deserves respect for everyone, deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our job is to stay with him", Valls said and deserved the applause.
As a satisfactory gesture, the Prime Minister urged the government to leave France alone despite the 35-hour working week of the controversial debate, despite the proposal made earlier by the new Minister of Economic Affairs Emmanuel Macron this week, that the rule should be repressed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to cooperate with the government.
However, the Minister of Justice, Christiane Taubira, gave rise to dissociation by presenting differing opinions at the meeting of socialist leaders and criticising the Socialist Party for allowing 'France to give up hope for the future'.
Marine Le Pen, director of the Right-wing National Front, mocked the socialist's constant disunity and said that he believed that the new government of Valls would not last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war with calls, but so has Manuel Valls, who was obliged to form a new government after the last one could not even last during the summer.
"And the new government will not last until autumn or winter," Le Pen said to the reporters.
He reiterated his party's proposal to disintegrate the parliament and held the election victory of his party in the early elections and he himself would be prepared to lead the party.
The French ruling party suffered a crushing blow in the municipalities of March and the extreme right held the main list in the EU elections in May.
According to the opinion poll of the Sunday Journal du Dimanche, 76% of French people believe that the Socialist Party may break up with a number of competing groups before the end of the Dutch period in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, political researcher at Po University, warned that the French will soon lose their patience if the new socialist government does not succeed in improving the economy and record high unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly notice that change is happening," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may get even worse.
Pokka failed the morning morning in the recorded part of the program by Finnish planners Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda.
Last Thursday, the morning Finnish program published a funny video of the recordings made on Thursday on its Facebook page.
In the video, the designers Kirsi Alm-Sira and Nina Rahkola, as well as meteorologist Pekka Pouta, are trying to record the morning after the Finnish advertising pub, but the recording does not go exactly to the pipe.
In his words, Alm-Sira is confused when he tries to say the word 'budget', and his confusion also makes Pouda and Rahkola lose her cheeks once and for all.
And these heroes should be allowed to pull the live broadcast tomorrow, and the Finnish Facebook update will find the morning morning.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been both popular and distributed more than 10,000 times on Facebook.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked at the film office of the magazine, was third in the potrets series in 1972.
This is Israel's Prime Minister, Golda Meir.
A socialist international meeting was held at the house of the Building Masters in Fredrikinkatu in May 1971.
There were a lot of heads of state at the meeting, and security was huge.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went with him.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we were given plenty of five minutes to take pictures.
I took this picture in four to five meters.
The light and the background were right.
I immediately realized that this time I succeeded.
From the look on the face of Meir, you can see that the leaders of the Middle East have had a difficult time before.
At that time, the images of known persons or events were taken.
It is wonderful that other images can be successful today, as long as there is an idea and a visual twist.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best is Lasse Virén's fall picture of the Munich Olympics.
I didn't send it to the competition.
Statement: The Aarnio investigator has already paid more than EUR 5 million
The investigation into the legality of the work of the Helsinki police department has already cost more than EUR 5 million and has required 30-50 years of work.
In this way, Jyri Rajamäki estimated to the University of Jyväskylä in his claim work on IT.
Rajamäki suggests that the control of the legality of police activities and the fight against crime in general could be significantly improved by combining IT systems for investigation and judicial proceedings.
According to Rajamäe, modern technology allows the multi-use of forensic material.
He notes that it is possible to build a system in which the information collected to investigate the crime is automatically electronic evidence satisfying the evidence chain and at the same time allows for comprehensive law enforcement.
The claim will be checked on Saturday.
Yle: The 1999 vision of vegetable food was forgotten on the school wall: "Fish and chicken dishes belonging to Kasvisdiet"
The picture of the special announcement on the wall of the Birkhla Women's Travel School caused food shortages in social media, says Yle on her website.
Vegetarians!
Fish and chicken dishes are part of the school lunch.
Only when there's meat on the list will we make a vegetable choice!
This is found in a magazine that left behind the school wall, 15 years old.
You can see the picture from here.
The picture in social media has led people to send an infuriated feedback to Pirkkala.
Arja Vaarma, Head of Food and Cleanliness Service, says to Yle that the note left behind on the wall is not correct and should have been removed a long time ago.
Apparently, before I came, there has been a time when such an idea has been discussed with healthcare.
Each student receives a meal according to his wishes, he says to Yle.
Today, in Pirkkala schools, students are offered a vegetarian alternative only with parents’ permission and a doctor or nurse’s certificate of herbal diet.
The stake justifies the solution to Yle, who is surprised by the fact that young people’s vegetable food trials may leave nutrition scarce, and the lack of meat or chicken can be a source of surprise for students’ parents.
Norwegian Cruise near the 3 billion dollar Prestige Cruise agreement
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise company in the world, is negotiating to buy its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for three billion dollars.
As a result of the transaction, Norwegian Cruise, with a market value of $6.8 billion, would have access to the luxury cruisers and wealthy customers of Prestige Cruises as it continues to compete against the larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to the sources, information on the possible agreement may already be published this week, although it is also possible that negotiations will not produce results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 % of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want their names to be made public, because there will be no negotiations in public.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to any comments and Apollo’s representative refused to comment.
The Norwegian Cruise company in Miami has 13 cruise ships with a route map covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, the Central America and the Caribbean.
Its net sales increased by 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013, when net sales amounted to USD 2,57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which operates from Miami, sails under the names of the Oceania and Regent brand, including a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavian, Russian, Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its net sales in 2013 were $1.2 billion, which is six per cent higher than in the previous year.
The 29 billion dollar cruise industry is expected to benefit from the rise in emerging economies, such as the China-India middle classes in the coming years.
The companies compete to become the first option for these new customers to choose a cruise.
Prestige Cruises will register the first issue of shares on the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company’s shares since the 2007 trade, worth $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in 2000 with its current composition, since it joined the Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) cruise company. The latter is the entertainment and casino company of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested a billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the information published, Genting accounted for 28 per cent of the company, Apollo for 20 per cent and TPG Capital LP for 8 per cent from the end of June.
The combined share of Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise in North America’s cruise capacity is 82 %, as shown in the registration document published by Prestige Cruise in connection with the issue of shares.
The City Government of Tampere will address this issue today.
Animalia would like to see strong support from the city government for this initiative.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, Managing Director of the Animalia, the doctoral thesis for the University of Tampere, during the dolphins in Finland and around the world, there is reason to end quickly.
In recent years, fortunately, the view has become common around the world that keeping advanced mammals like dolphins in dolphins is neither animal protection nor ethically sustainable.
This view would also be taken to Tampere.
The abolition of the Delfinario is not only an animal law issue, but also a question of Tampere's image as a tourist destination," Tuomivaara points out.
According to the judge's threat, the death of Näsi dolphin confirms the requirements for a dolphin operation to run off.
The death of a man is a sad continuation of the dark history of the Delfinarion of Särkäniemi.
It is time to put a stop to the deaths, close the dolphins prison, and find out how to transfer the dolphins to a restricted sea area, to a kind of dolphin shelter, Tuomivaara demands.
The vision did not have time to go back to the original environment of dolphins, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Tääränniemi will have time to experience more than their unrevealed concrete, Tuomivaara hopes.
The aim of the Animal Protection Union is to ban the use of all wild species in circuses in the overall reform of the Animal Protection Act under preparation.
This includes dolphins.
In support of the request, the Executive Director of the Animalia, Mr Tuomivaara, is taking part in the 1.9. on behalf of the dolphins.
The Japanese Embassy's demonstration in Helsinki takes a stand against the dolphin hunt in Japan.
During the hunting season, approximately 2300 dolphins, either for use in dolphins or for food, are brutally imprisoned or killed annually.
Putin calls on Kiev to open negotiations on a new state with East Ukraine
On Sunday, President Putin of Russia said that the Ukrainian government would end the fight against separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately start negotiations on a region that is different from 'nationality', the Russian news reports.
His representative Dmitry Peskov later explained that Putin did not mean that Russia would become part of the eastern Ukrainian region under the Separatist regime, but that its role within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking population the power to defend their own rights and interests.
The demand made by Putin to the Kiev Government for negotiations with Russian rebels as equal negotiating partners is in line with his obvious strategy since the violence began five years ago: he is trying to help separatists take over the region and thus force the Ukrainian Government to give the newly declared Novorossian independence, which will allow it to turn to Russia instead of the West.
In his interview with the State Channel 1 TV channel Putin condemned the Ukrainian army's efforts to reintegrate the Eastern Donetsk and Luhanski region controlled by separatists, whose separatists took over in March and April after Moscow joined the Crimean Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and Separatists have recently baptized the area "Novorossija", "New Russia" – this term is similar to the days of glory before the major revolutions of Russia.
According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said that the planned peace negotiations are an 'inspired' as long as Ukrainian politicians are campaigning for the 26 October parliamentary elections and government forces are attacking civilians in separatists' areas.
"We must start wide-ranging negotiations immediately, not only on technical matters, but also on the organisation of society and the position of the state of South-East Ukraine, which takes account of the interests of the people who live there," he says.
According to Peskov, Putin's reference to 'nationality' relates to the broader independence which has been discussed with Kiev's leadership for months in its attempt to eliminate the fears of the Russian-speaking regions in order to threaten their cultural and linguistic rights.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need, says Peskov.
There is no debate on this issue between Ukraine and Russia, says Peskov, 'because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict within Ukraine'.
The intervention by the representative of the Kreml, aimed at correcting Putin's 'false interpretation', stressed that the Russian regime is dealing with the separatist rebellion of the eastern regions in a different way from that of Crimea, which, in practice, took over an area where the majority of the population of 2 million people is ethnically Russian.
Moscow would be much more difficult to connect even the Donetsk or the Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, because most of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russian, and according to pre-conflict surveys the majority of the population supported staying in Ukraine.
The independence which Russian diplomats have been discussing in international fora would give local authorities in Ukraine the right to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give the Kremlin, in practice, in an area of power that connects Russia to Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was annexed to Russia five months ago, is located in Russia's main fleet, as well as in commercial ports and historic coastal destinations.
In the region between Rostov and Crimea there are also mines, factories and metal silos that produce vital products for the Russian army.
On 7 June, President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko proposed that the Ukrainian legislators, after the new elections, consider changes to the Constitution in order to increase the decision-making power of regions other than the Ukrainian core region on their own economy and the status of languages.
His vision of independence, however, seems to differ sharply from the view of the separatists who may be armed and flamed by the Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin's most recent demand for the Kiev government to negotiate with Russian rebels as equal partners after the rebels made further progress last week after the invasion of Russian tanks and troops from the previously peaceful region of the Azov Sea.
The Ukrainian security authorities fear that taking over the city of Novoazovsk, supported by Russian separatists, is the beginning of a greater effort to take over the entire strategically important coastal region to Crimea.
It has led to a massive strengthening of the city of Mariupol by civilians and military personnel, and Mariupol, half a million inhabitants, is known as the steel-producing port city located between Novoazovsk and the narrow land leading to the Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday, Mr Poroshenko spoke to the leaders of the European Union in Brussels asking for further measures to prevent future violations of Russia in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We're about to reach a point where there's no turning back," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take decisions on direct action; additional sanctions were put forward by the leaders in order to introduce them if the Ukrainian crisis re-emerged in unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in the region of Ilovakis after two Russian armed forces and 1,000 soldiers moved to Donetsk last week to strengthen the separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told journalists on Saturday in Kiev.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers to be surrounded by Russia in Ilovaisk was replaced by 10 Russian paratroopers who were imprisoned in the territory of Ukraine a week ago.
Milan's opening painting was made by Japanese singer Keisuke Honda on the seventh minute of the game.
In the second half, Sulley Muntar was hit first, and shortly later Jeremy Menez was punished.
Laziok was given a rank at the end of the game after his narrowing paint, but the goaltender Diego Lopez rejected Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan for this season from Real Madrid.
In the Inzagh training debyte of Milan's former attacker, the San Siro Stadium was only half the size.
A total of 39 000 viewers were announced.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko at the spin of the nude image scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he's upset with hackers maybe stolen his fiancée and Hollywood's A-list Gabi Grecko nude.
In the entertainment world, a group of naked images of Jennifer Lawrence were published on the Internet as a result of a wide-ranging celebrity hacking scandal.
The hacker has been said to have a total of 60 nudity images of the Star of the Hunger Games Lawrence as well as other superstars such as Kate Upton and Cara Delevingnes, singer Rihana, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actor Kirsten Dunst.
Also, images of Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Grecko in Melbourne have apparently been stolen during the iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrity names on the list.
Last month, Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko, said to the Confidential newspaper, "This is disgusting."
All personal contacts and images should remain private.
It is a disgrace that private data can be stolen and disseminated.
Greckon, in New York, is reported with comments on the case in the webpage "as a disgrace" and said that the victims "are ashamed of themselves".
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with this previous boyfriend, Scott Speedman, including two samples of Palmer in the topless pool.
Palmer's films include a movie "Love and Honor" with opponent Liam Hemsworth.
