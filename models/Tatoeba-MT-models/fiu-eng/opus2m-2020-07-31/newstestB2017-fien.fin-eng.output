The 28-year-old cook was found dead in a sanfranciscola mall
A 28-year-old cook who just moved to San Francisco was found dead on the stairs of the local shopping center this week.
The victim's brother says that he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother. "He had finally arranged his case."
The body found at the Westfield Shopping Center on Wednesday morning was identified as a sanfranciscola Frank Galicia, reportedly from the San Francisco Medical Office.
According to San Francisco Police Department, death is being investigated as a homicide.
The victim’s brother Louis Galicia told the KGO radio station in San Francisco at ABC that Frank, who had previously worked as a cook in Boston, had found his dream job in letting San Francisco’s Sons & Daughters kitchen master six months ago.
The representative of the Sons & Daughters restaurant said that death was a shock for all of them.
"We're a small and tight team, like a family.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia tells us that Frank lived at the hostel first, but he had finally arranged his case.
"He found the apartment, and he had a girlfriend," told Louis Galicia KGO.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
"He was kind and kind.
His way of being with the family was to make food for all of us," says Louis Galici.
"He never wanted to get into a fight with anyone.
He was a brother who walked with the river.
Despite all the wrongs in the world, he was an unworked diamond that shined every day," he says.
Anyone who knows anything about this case will be asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's hotline 415-575-444.
New labour-related measures are required by leaching junior doctors
The representatives of British junior doctors (mostly specialised doctors in Finland) have appealed to their trade union and have asked for authorisation for new labour-related measures in a dispute on a new contract of employment.
The JDC Committee, which is a member of the British Trade Union (BMA), is calling on its entire government to support further labour-related measures from the beginning of September.
According to the JDC, the ministers have not solved the problem of the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with BMA during the vote in July.
58% of the members who took part in the vote rejected the agreement.
On Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Committee, Ellen McCourt, published a letter on Twitter to the members of the JDC, in which he says that the government 'suffered persistently' questions which, according to McCourt, led to the rejection of the agreement.
The letter states: "In light of this, the JDC government has voted in favour of a completely new draft agreement and calls for new formal negotiations to be conducted on all our concerns.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Government has today submitted a formal request to the BMA Government requesting authorisation for least progressive labour-related measures since the beginning of September."
As a result of the dispute, junior doctors have been struck six times this year, which included the first complete job arrests ever seen in the history of the British public health system.
Mr Malawana, Director of the junior doctors at BMA, resigned after the vote because he did not accept the negotiated contractual terms recommended by BMA.
In previous meetings, Malawana told BMA members that the agreement was good and should be approved. 54 000 junior doctors and medical students took part in the vote.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement would enter into force and concern British doctors.
Russia and Turkey: an external alliance?
It was an gesture that ended the crisis.
On Tuesday, the leaders of Russia and Turkey met with a hand to settle and finalise the word war and economic sanctions that lasted eight months.
However, when Vladimir Putin took over his Turkish brother in the golden hall at his palace in St. Petersburg, I received a clear impression that there was a greater desire for reconciliation with Ankara.
The parties did shake hands.
But Putin's smile seemed thin, and he didn't even pour heat on his own restraining standard.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke about his "good friend" Mr Putin – according to a report five times.
I couldn't keep my bills.
In addition, he promised that relations with Russia would come back even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country wrote that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I personally understood his zeal on the contrary.
But Putin’s porpoise continued violins showed that the Russian chief has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the reason for the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction to the event was violent.
Putin made a firm attack on Ankara and accused him of stabing his back.
The insult was even greater because it came from a supposed friend.
Getting real trust back will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The public opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
The media controlled by the State for months went through a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, however, it seemed that the Turks were the cause of everything.
The most serious were the accusations of top officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in Isis-controlled areas in Syria.
Erdogan has strongly denied the accusations.
But the official message from Peter was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting was held only to obtain an apology from President Erdogan.
In this way, Russia could have gained some kind of victory.
The benefits of declaring a serious weapon are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost sidelined last month in a failed coup.
He has also been clearly shaken by repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey.
There is also an economic impact on the agreement.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard, especially the charter flight ban, since, normally, millions of Russian tourists travel to the Turkish coast every year.
The amount has collapsed by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charterers will certainly be relieved when air traffic can finally continue.
They're putting their faith in the late season rushing into the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state television has predicted that the price of fruit and vegetables will fall when Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
"Accompanies there, tomatoes back here," was formulated in the magazine Vedemost article.
But the visit also had greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because the West feels that it reacts to the attempt of coup.
Let us not forget the old grudge about Turkey's EU membership negotiations and about Putin's involvement in matters, which is eager to take advantage of the cool gap and break the ties of Turkey westward.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when he expressed his support for the elected authorities after the coup.
This was self-evident to Moscow, who is concerned about the change of power.
Thus, at their summit, Russia and Turkey could convey the image of an analyst described as a "outer alliance": two countries that experienced the rejections of the West and were treated as being united.
Despite the public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.
The most important is Syria, where Moscow has created itself as a peace-building company, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It goes on to say that, after almost three hours of initial negotiations, both presidents told us at the press conference that they had not dealt with the subject at all.
The Turkish President deliberately refused to answer the question of countries' differences, while Putin stressed them.
There is no clear consensus between the countries on where they can seek agreement in Syria.
In view of the possibility of a complete disaster caused by the NATO Member State Turkey when shooting down a Russian combat machine, it is undoubtedly better that, after months of open hostilities, these two Heads of State will once again be in the speaking rooms.
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear from customers outside Scotland
According to RBS’s CEO, the bank’s activities outside Scotland will be reduced so that it will only provide business services, i.e. back office services.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed the broadcaster BBC Scotland that the RBS brand originally had to do with the Bank’s global objectives.
The bank was forced to withdraw from its goals when it almost collapsed eight years ago and was forced to be saved.
During that period, branding practices have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsored international sports with millions of pounds, such as Six Nationsrugby and Wimbledon Master Andy Murray.
But now it is considered right to let more national brands go into the front.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain at the disposal of Scottish customers, but it will not be shortened by RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are converted into NatWeste, with the exception of head office and stock exchange listing.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a presentation to customers and staff at Inverness-shire.
He said to BBC Scotland: "RBS will become an investment brand and because of the fact that our staff is in service because we are now becoming a bank of different brands.
Since the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our efforts are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in their own community, and our staff is working with customers under these brands."
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nationsrugby and that it has increased the profile of different brands in sport sponsorship.
"Now is the time to turn into a bank with different brands, because essentially it is a question of how we can make the bank better for customers," says the President of the Bank.
"It would have been very unpleasant three years ago if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and have used the brands.
But the work we have done and the focus we have done on the needs of our customers has changed a lot instead of our own needs.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right."
Frankie Dettor rode the Predilection to victory in Newmarket and won the 3 000th victory
The Dettor sprays champagne twice in a row at Newmarket, which meant $3,000 to him.
Jockey Frankie Dettor confirmed his $3,000 victory at the British Championship in Newmarket on Friday.
He reached this milestone by riding his horse Predilection twice that night on the track of his own locality. The predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey, which reaches this milestone in even-track competitions.
He was previously reached by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Detori, who previously won in Ghayyar, says, "This is special.
My feelings are on the surface because my family is here, too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because I ended up here 30 years ago.
The event is not a big event, not a Royal Ascot, but a completely ordinary Friday night and a total audience of 20,000 people.
I'm relieved, and I feel a great humility."
Dettor takes cheers with Predilection after his victory
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the antitrust competitions, and they are champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won more than 4 300 times in his record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4 493 wins
"Frankie is one of the best jockeys of this time, and it is no surprise that she has reached this milestone that few have reached.
He's elegant and strong, but his tactical integrity is what separates him from others.
He is a fantastic representative of the race race, his enthusiasm, and his charisma have brought the species backers for years."
"I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have won 6,000 races already if he didn't compete only on weekends and only on the big races!
Seriously, Frankie's riding career in the UK has been winning for almost 30 years, and it's been amazing to follow.
He's a lively person, which is good for the British race, but above all, he's an incredible jockey."
Frankie Dettor fanned his achievement in a symbolic way by jumping off his horse.
"From flying paint incomes to drone landings Frankie Dettori has been a model for British racing for two decades.
We've got tops and bottoms on the way.
He has won numerous big races, including his famous victory at Ascot in 1996 "Magnificent Seven", but in addition he has survived a plane accident and has been in a non-competition ban due to drug abuse.
When the non-competition ended three years ago, he had difficulty starting, but he showed an admirable nature, showed his suspects and returned to his best.
And for some time now he is not going to finish his career – Dettor has recently said that he wants to continue his competitive career until at least 50 years of age."
Putin fired Chief of Administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly dismissed Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for several years.
Mr Ivanov, 63, has now been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
According to Kremlin’s statement, President Putin “sent to release Ivanov’s duties as Head of the Russian President’s Administration” but no justification for dismissal was given.
As of 2012, Anton Vaino, an alternate manager of Ivanov, was appointed.
Parano, 44, is a former diplomat.
In 1972, Vaino, born in Tallinn, graduated from the highly respected Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he was in charge of the President's protocol department and the government office," says the Kremlin's Russian-language website.
The persecution thanked Putin for his appointment in the following words: "I am grateful for your confidence.
I believe that the most important task of administration is to support your activities as Head of State, which means making draft laws and monitoring how to implement the instructions you have given."
Putin told the Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov himself had asked for a divorce and recommended that he be his successor.
Are the smiles real?
This transfer has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been in the vicinity of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, has a history of KGB.
He was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At the meeting with President Putin, the Russian state's television show, both said Ivanov would withdraw from his own request.
In spite of the smiles shown to the cameras, the explanations are limited, especially during the parliamentary elections.
Are the fires the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has had a very suspicious view of the formal claim that a man who is a potential President suddenly wants to lead Russian environmental policy.
The Kreml website presents Ivanov's words to Putin, where he says: "It is true that at the beginning of 2012, I asked you to give me responsibility for this very complex and to some extent even a difficult task for four years.
Now I have served as the President's chief of administration for four years and eight months."
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Before that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB of the State Security Service.
When Putin replaced the KGB as Head of the Federation Security Service (FSB) in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed Deputy Chief of Staff.
When Putin came into power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov might become President of Russia after the second period, because the Constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected for the third period.
However, the assignment went to another person in the vicinity of Putin, Dmitri Medvedeville.
Putin became Prime Minister, after which he returned to president only three and a half years later.
The star of the Criminal Minds series, Thomas Gibson, was fired after the producer was defeated.
Gibson was involved in a violent fight at the crime scene in Los Angeles last month.
The ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios produced a series of fires in their joint press release.
As Special Agent Aaron Hotchner in the series, Gibson had issued an apology on Thursday before his resignation was announced.
"We had creative differences.
I'm sorry this happened here," he says in his press release.
Information on how Gibson's character is written out of the next series of FBI agents will be published later, reported in the press release of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Previously on the comedy series Dharma & Greg, 54-year-old Gibson has been in the series since its first production period, i.e. since 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul on it for the last twelve years," says Gibson in her release on Friday.
"I hoped I'd see it all the way to the end of the show, but it's no longer possible.
I would like to thank all the scriptwriters, producers, actors, our great production team and the most important: the best fans that the series could ever have hoped for."
The 12th series of production seasons will begin in the United States on September 28.
The mysterious landing of fish in the Banffian Garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects that these 75 fish are windflakes that have been caught in the ground by a hurricane.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the sea coast, published image material in Periscope and hoped to receive a response to the appearance of these five - year - old fish.
The Queensferry Crosses are now connected to Fifee
The EUR 1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern deck and the main bridge of Queensferry, which means that the bridge is now connected to the Fife.
It is the first of the four parts between the "creeps", which are now almost ready around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It contains 10 000 tonnes of steel and 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 glazed wires.
The EUR 1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
The Minister of State for Economic Affairs Keith Brown visited the workplace today and was one of the first to walk from country to bridge.
Brown says, "This is an historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry's crossing bridge.
We are all witnessing a truly significant step forward in building a bridge. More than 30 000 concrete and steel have been used to build this section of the bridge alone.
Despite its massive size and weight, building bridge-to-bridge section is a subtle operation that requires extremely precise installation tolerances.
Almost 79% of the entire bridge is now in place, and the rest of the deck is about to receive its concrete crack in Rosyth today, which means that the deck is ready to be lifted."
Michael Martin, Head of Forth Crossing Bridge Builders, says: "The completion of the first section of the bridge is always an important urinal for all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this proportion represents the top in the road and water construction sector.
After the last part of the road cover had been installed and connected to the road cover of the North Tower, we had to close the remaining North Side (i.e. the Earthside) gap.
This was done by pulling 700 mm [700 mm] south from the north side of the continent.
This was a massive and simultaneously demanding operation.
Massive because of a 222 - foot [22 m] length of earth and a weight of about 6 000 tonnes, it had to be drawn up at an angle of approximately 3 per cent.
And with great precision, the tolerances that the team had to follow were very small — only a few millimeters.
I'm glad everything went well."
Moelfre Bay Rescue Station tells us about the miracle rescue of three men.
Anglesey, out of her fishing boat, saved three men from water like a miracle to trade.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station made an alarm on Friday at 13.20 local time in the Gulf of Moelfre Bay of Moelfre.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety while their boat continued its reckless course without a pilot.
"We saw a boat running right next to them, and we imagined the worst," says Vince Jones, the Moelfre lifeboat.
"By the time we got into the water, "happily, the strong winds had moved the boat away from them."
The local fishing boat saved two of the men, while the third, 60-year-old, was found to be exhausted with the hangover and no life jackets.
All of them were taken to the coastal rescue boat and transported to the rescue station.
Vince Jones says: "It is a miracle that these three men who have been watered are still alive and perfectly well.
There was an emergency firecracker in the boat's engine, but for some reason it had been loosened by the fall of the boat from the man who ran the boat.
They were very lucky on their way."
The Pokémon Go hunt brings health and happiness
It's fascinating to watch how the world changes.
During the last decade, many have complained about why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but prefer to stay inside to stare at their screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get off the couch and move on.
Originally it took the screen to watch TV, and then there were video games and the latest smartphones.
So it is wonderful to note that technology and the external movement do not exclude each other.
Of course, I am referring to the Pokémon Go. Pokémon Go is a game application, the characters of which are derived from the video game created in the 1990s (of which also later the drawing series, game cards and other ancillary products were made).
As with many popular cultural phenomena, this also slipped a little before the new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
Lanseing in other countries was delayed because of a huge interest that overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the number of users of the Pokémon Go game passed Tinder and was almost as large as on Twitter.
So how does the game work?
In short, players will go out looking for pokémonones on their smartphones, which will be monitored using GPS. When you find a pokémon, it can be "photo" (using your phone screenshot) or "paint".
Stunning has forced a generation younger than a video game and raised their backsides from the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps that the average person takes every day.
Washington Post recently reported on a Cardiogram app of Apple Watch, which found within two days of the launch of the game, that the number of people moving 30 minutes a day suddenly rose from 45% to 53%. The Cardiogram follows 35 000 users.
The company does not know which users play Pokémon Go, it only sees the raw data on the amount of exercise.
Many public health campaigns that encourage people to get off the couch and move for at least 30 minutes a day have fallen on deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertisers have looked unhappy.
However, the importance of sports should not be reduced.
Regularly moving people are less likely to have cancer or depression.
Exercise helps control weight, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings great benefits.
The beauty of the Pokémon Go game is that it makes people out to do something they enjoy.
This will achieve three basic health - supportive issues — exercise, fresh air, and sun, and joy.
It's possible to make even new friends during the hunt.
As usual, this phenomenon includes wicked evangelists.
And yes, someone can walk towards the door when they're playing.
What about it?
We've got a breakthrough.
For even though Smartphone applications like Fitbit may have followed your activity in the past, they did not allow the cause to move, as Pokémon Go does.
The novelty will disappear, and the use will decrease in time.
However, the success of pokémons will lead to more games combining applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world, which will increase the physical activity and health of people who go hunting.

Simone Biles caught gold in a women's hive fight.
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hypnotism.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these things.
Dynamic jumps.
It's easy on the boom.
Your jaws are ruffled with permanance.
That's great.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American freighter won the multi-game championship and raised the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympics.
His total score was clearly better than that of Aly Raisman and Russian Bronzeist Aliya Mustafin, a silver-based teammate.
The United States Simone Biles will take part in the final final of the multi-competition of women’s tennis team in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday 2016.
The party became the fourth consecutive and the fifth American woman of all time who won the championship of the multi-stakeholder, thus strengthening his reputation for the best or even the best of all time.
The party burst into tears when his total final points came to light and his long journey to this moment ended.
The achievement takes the species to a whole new dimension and brings him to the same class as other superstars of sport, such as Michael Phelps:
He has won the 15 World Cup medals, of which 10 gold, and earned them with such ambitious and precise programmes that, in 1984, the Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton called him "the most powerful freighter of all time".
In Brazil, there was another final competition, especially between Bales and himself and the burden of excessive expectations, not so much between Bales and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Texas Spring with less than a handful of gold medals would be a disappointment.
Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman, after winning gold and silver in the finals of the multi-competition of the women's tennis team in Rio on Thursday, 2016 in the Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics, Brazil. 11 August 2016
The first gold medal was won by Bales on Tuesday as a point to Martha Karoly's bachelor party who coordinated the country team and now retired.
Although Bales claimed that he had never thought of anything in advance when he was at the top, it is not entirely true.
Some of his permanto program, which includes a series of volts known as his card, has been adapted to Latin music, which might well be heard on the streets outside the Rio Olympics.
It's not a coincidence.
When his grandparents were little and coach Aimee Boorman's mother found her, Boorman found the girl when she was on a day-care trip to the gym where Boorman was trained.
He has not lost any multi-competition competition since summer 2013, and the winning streak is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina was able to get into a small conduct on two rounds, it was like a mirage.
There was a boom and a permanto where Bales is the champion of the world.
He got back to the lead position after getting 15.433 points and crowned the final result with 15.933 points.
Raisma gently hugged him while they were waiting for final points — a mere formality — and tears began to appear around the red, white, and blue glare of Bales when his dream of writing his book came true.
Raisman's performance was a small revantage to the competition four years ago, when he first divided the third place but then lost the bronze to Mustafina in the reround.
This time, 22-year-old team leader, who the Americans call "mum" was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent airmen to the public after his permanto program, and so he rose from a defeat position to a winner, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
As far as Biles is concerned, this 19-year-old, earlier week's wide-ranging tweeting now has a whole new meaning:
Police report three music in the car as the victim of a serial killer.
Two women and one 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's most devastating mass murder for ten years.
According to the authorities, Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter were shot in a car parked on the streetside on June 12th.
The shooter stood on the side of the passenger side of the car, where he fired eight shots with a handgun and then escaped with another car, says the bulletin.
The police suspect that the cause of the triple death was not a robbery, because the attacker didn't take the purses or the $2,900 found in the second adult victim's armor.
Phoenix police informant, Sergeant Jonathan Howard says the police are now investigating whether death is linked to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have died and two have been wounded in nine attacks, which have occurred mainly in the Latin American inhabited areas within four months.
"It is common for events that they have occurred in the residential areas before homes," Howard told CBS’ subsidiary KPHO of the television and radio company earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including the late 1990s brown Nissan, the late 1990s black BMW and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Researchers do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are related and that they are the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital because of his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died immediately at the scene.
The witness told the police that the triangle had often sat in the car listening to music.
In addition, the police published a bulletin containing only half an hour before the triple death of an empty open van, which is believed to be the same in both cases.
The scientists found shells and recovered the bullet from the car seat and the fragments of the bullet from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old son with microkephalia: "Things get better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most other agemates, Edmund has a micro-kephalia, i.e. an inborn infantry due to a genetic disorder of his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, which she was not aware of when she was pregnant.
"When I brought Edmund home for the first time, my first thought was that I wouldn't make it.
I'm not gonna make it.
I didn't commit to this.
What is not true at all – of course you are committed to it," he says.
Elizabeth and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never recognize them and perhaps not survive at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest that the child be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that I didn't think there was any more of that practice," says Picciuto.
Edmund walks with the help of a roller.
Edmund just sat down and started to stand there when he was 3 years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's slowly moving on at his own pace.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
He's happy to play with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth is presenting the sign that Edmund invented, which means "sing for me".
"We'll teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not only mean normal sign language, but also includes those invented by Edmund himself.
Microcephalitis can be caused by a variety of diseases: hereditary, such as Edmund, or during pregnancy, such as Cinderella or Cinderella.
There are great variations in the symptoms and predictions.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the lives of those who are infected with the zizavirus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional storm caused by an uncertain future.
"I kept saying, "how do we do,
How we're gonna do it."
He still doesn't know.
"I haven't asked for a prophecy in a while, because I don't think anyone can give it to me."
But Picciuto has hope for advice on mothers whose children have birth defects caused by the zizavirus.
Things are getting better.
Things tend to work out.
You love your child, and your child loves you."
Heavy rains and floods caused massive rescue operations in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi
On Friday, the governor of Louisiana declared an emergency due to heavy rainfall and widespread floods, and more rain for the state is expected on Saturday.
According to the national weather service, several rivers in south-eastern Louisiana and South-South of Mississippi flooded their plains and spread to a wide area as a result of heavy rainfall.
The governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, says that the state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and help is already on the way to flood areas.
Mike Steele, informs the Governor's Office for National Security and Emergency Capability, says that the Agency receives requests for flood vehicles, boats and sands.
According to Steele, the only county of Tangipahea has asked for tens of thousands of sand bags.
The flood warning remains valid until Saturday in most of South Louisiana.
According to the weather service press release, the area may still have 76-127 mm more water.
A flood warning was issued in South Alabama on Friday when the rains continued in the Mobile area.
During the weekend, near the Comite River, near the Baton Rouge and the Amite River, near the Denham Springs, both of which in Louisiana, are predicted to rise to record heights.
According to weatherer Alek Krautmann, many houses along the rivers may be flooded in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
In addition, he says that the floods in the district of Ascension constitute a threat, for the flooding rivers are slowly emptying into Lake Maurepas.
In Liverpool, Louisiana, the Tickfaw River, right south of the state of Mississippi, had already risen to a higher level than ever on Friday at 9 a.m.
The rescue work continued in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and half-witches were earlier near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that the Beaver Creek River, which is normally over 120 metres from his house, rose quickly during the night.
He had been warned by the other half who lived nearby.
"We got up, and the water came with continuous feeding," says Hansford.
"It reached my waist."
The wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years she had lived in the area.
Hansford tells us that he and his family are all injured, and he is the only one who can swim.
The rescue workers had saved all three large military-style trucks and taken them to the fire station in Gloster, where they held protection on Friday.
Weather forecaster Krautmann says that floods are spreading rapidly as heavy rains continue, and the authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He tells of information from an observer close to Livingston that it was almost 350 mm between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says that the soil was soaked after the rains that started on Wednesday.
The authorities tell us that due to the flooding of heavy rains and streets, residents of the Tangi Devil County were forced to rescue their homes, and school hours were cancelled in five school districts.
A member of the City Council of Tangibo City had told CBS’ subsidiary WWL that 200 homes were under the flood.
The inhabitants had been evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has reached them both.
The county leader, Robby Miller, reports that the authorities saved 72 people and seven pets who had remained captive to the flood.
We've opened shelters for the evacuated people in the cities of Amite and Hammond.
"They get back to their homes when the water starts to withdraw," he says.
In the town of Hammond, near twenty streets were shut down because of the flood, and sand bags were offered to the residents to try to prevent water from entering their homes and businesses.
"The last time we had a great flood in March," says Lacy Landrum, Member of the City Government.
"This flood seems to be the same."
In Mississip, the rains continued to be constant on the Gulf coast, reports Rupert Lacy, the rescue director of Harrison County.
Lacy reports that on Thursday there was a report of a house under a vulture, but on Friday there had not been any information at all.
The head of the Shopper Value Foods Store Keith Townson says he's been living in the Amite Region for 40 years now.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before, and it's raining all the time."
The six-year-old Maháj Brown, who's been shot in his body, survives the shooting scene in Philadelphia.
According to the police, a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, who is now another 6-year-old who has been shot in town this week.
The kid's grandparents told me that the CBS Philadelphia channel had a son named Mahaha Brown.
According to the grandparents, the boy had multiple gunshot wounds in his arms, legs, arms, and abdomen, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got many hits, his little body was full of bullets," said the boy's grandmother Delores Melendez to the television company.
"I can't believe this is happening."
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital, and he has had several surgeries.
The family tells the television company that the boy is supposed to survive.
He was starting his first grade at local secondary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown district.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man were also shot.
Another 29-year-old was reported to be critical and the other two were stable, says CBS Philadelphia.
According to the television company, the child was found on the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are now investigating whether one of the wounded men could have been a shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crossfire between several armed men.
The scene was filled with assault weapon-type shells from various types of assault weapon.
"It is quite clear that this was a ongoing battle.
There were shells on the street on both sides of the sidewalk.
There have been several armed fighters, and they have been actively involved in the shooting," the Chief Inspector of the Philadelphia Police, Anthony Ginaldi, told the television station.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
There's no arrests, and I hear the police are going through surveillance videos.
Another shooting victim in the city this week was a six-year-old girl who was hit by mistrust while he was playing outside his home on Tuesday in the West Oak Lane district.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
This is what I call the Olympic Team of Women's Tent Forces, and there are more than one reasons for this.
Firstly, I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as overwhelming as it is now.
Second, the three gymnasts of this team, Simone Bales, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colored girls.
The team’s composition, supplemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team is finally representing America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the species.
For the last four years, the best female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were placed 1 and 2.
This is great.
At the previous Olympic Games Gabby Douglas rose as a surprise winner, and the whole of America cheered.
The world has now witnessed the incredible performances of Simone Bales, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, a three-time world champion, and the surprising and masterly frame-lifting programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth consecutive American who won gold in a multi-stakeholder match for women.
Teammate Aly Raisman, on the other hand, won silver.
The views are like this at the top of the species, but the same does not appear for the whole country-wide decking lessons.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same tracks Aly and Madison had to form an Olympic team.
They are the last five (Final Five), for there will be only four gymnasts in the next Tent Team, and this will be Marta Karoly's last year of coaching.
The reality is, however, that yardlifting is an expensive sport and gymnastics practice mainly in private trucks, which are maintained by their parents. Parents are paid for training costs, facilities, trips, performances, competitive fees, hotel fees (trainers, gymnasts and family members) etc.
The premises of most freight stations are located in prosperous residential areas that are able to support the operation.
The teaching of agency workers takes place in these areas, and this means expensive and long - term commitment to the families of gymnastics workers.
Simone Bales coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have both trained species practitioners since they started the hive.
We need to organise a more affordable and more accessible telecommunications teaching for countless young girls whose enthusiasm has been aroused by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I set up my own camping foundation 20 years ago.
My organisations in Harlem have provided free or affordable opportunities for more than 15,000 urban youths (mostly black and Latin American), and some of these young people have reached national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our activities to my home town in Detroit, so that we can offer high-quality decking for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic species.
Testimonial strength develops strength, perseverance and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings life-long benefits and supports good health and success in school and working life.
This team has aroused the enthusiasm of thousands of young girls, who now want to start the hive force, and it is absolutely awesome.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the real "girl power" you showed when you won the Olympic gold, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start their way into well-being, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal and are preparing for a new strike.
Ministers hoped to decide on the changes to pay and working conditions by accepting the renewed agreement with the British Medical Association (BMA), but the 37 000 junior doctors who took part in the vote, or 58% of a specialist doctor, rejected the proposal.
In July, Minister of Health Hunt told us of the plans to get the agreement up to date and said that the British public health system (NHS) is "no one in the country" and that all further delays are harmful to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will move to a new agreement containing changes to the practices of night and weekend work in order to improve health care in non-social times.
Last night, President Ellen McCourt of the Committee on Junior Medicine of BMA, in which he said: "Junior doctors are still very cautious about the proposed agreement, and there is a particular fear that it will speed up the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
It is only eight weeks before the first doctors are transferred to the new agreement, so we have to move forward, because the time is running out.
BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by speaking of it, but the government has been reluctant and sometimes not even reacting in any way to the discussion efforts.
Despite the fact that Jeremy Hunt made a promise last month that his door would always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, repeal the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If that is not the case, the junior doctors will be ready for new work-related measures."
At the end of April, the previous strike delayed nearly 13,000 routine procedures and 100,000 reception times when nurses and consultants were asked to support the strike guard.
Ministers hoped to conclude the dispute on change by concluding a renewed agreement with the British Trade Union staff representing doctors.
The trade union BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54 000 junior doctors, who would be covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of NHS employees, appealed to junior doctors not to strike again.
Mortimer says: "Employment measures achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services that already exist at extreme borders and cause anxiety, distress and disruptions to patients, care personnel and their families.
For the last two months, we have been negotiating with the JP Committee, and together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of supervisors and the exposure of abuses.
The employees were hopeful that the continued positive commitment to other important issues such as development, flexibility in education, further training for those returning from work, training costs, recognition of the curriculum, study-free and gender pay gap in the field of care – was a sign of the seriousness of the agreements concluded with BMA in November, February and May.
A medicine paying approximately €2.40 per day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are about €2.40 a day, when the authorities recommended giving it to more people and for longer-term use.
Anti-coagulant ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The medicine is already given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of stroke or new heart attack.
ticagrelor should be administered to patients for four years in order to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems further.
But now the NICE, which is part of the British Public Health System (NHS) and assesses the introduction of new treatment methods, has instructed that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years in order to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems further.
In England, about 140 000 people get a heart attack each year, one in four of which is relapsed or stroked.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is a fatty substance that accumulates on the walls of the blood vessels, which causes plaques.
If the plaque breaks, it can cause a blood clot that prevents blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if a blood clot is removed, it can travel with a bloodstream and prevent blood from flowing into the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new seizure is greater in people who have had a heart attack.
The ticagrelor produced by AstraZeneca, British, sold under the product name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of stoppers.
The draft NICE guidelines published today recommend that ticagrelor 90 mg be administered for the next 12 months, then reduced to 60 mg and additional aspirin twice daily for a further three years.
Professor Carole Longson of the Centre for the Implementation of Treatment Methods (NICE) says: "Although effective treatment methods to prevent disease progression and onset of symptoms are available, up to a quarter of those who have had a heart attack get a new seizure or stroke – often with fatal consequences.
Fear of renewal can have a very negative impact on human quality of life.
We have received evidence that ticagrelor, combined with aspirin, effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Recommendation on the temporary use of ticagrelor increases treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it."
As data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, in particular as regards the risk of bleeding, are limited if used for more than three years, the longer the duration of the treatment method is not recommended in the draft guide.
Because of the climate of political correctness, the vote in Muslim regions has flourished
The former Mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was expelled last year because of corruption, resulting in a report by the government
The climate of political correctness led to the close of the eyes from widespread malpractice in the Muslim communities, revealing today's government report.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticized the police, election observers and city councils for keeping their eyes closed to election fraud because of 'the hypersensitivity to prosperity and religion'.
According to the former Minister of Regional Administration and today's anti-corruption power figure Pickles, it was so bad to scare voters for religious reasons that the police should have been allowed to form security chains outside the polling stations so that the scared voters could be protected.
He suggests that voters should present an identity card in order to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At the moment, the voter must only state his name and address.
In addition, the report proposes that fingers be irrigated after voting in an indiscriminate muse so that no one can vote twice.
We should protect the public more, says Sir Eric.
He called for the journalists' access to government documents and decisions of informal committees and working groups to be improved.
"The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to combat corruption and fraud against economic interests and culture that favours them more widely in local administrations," he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report after the vote scandal at Tower Hamlet in East London.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court ordered mayor Lutfur Rahman to resign from office because of corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The Court considered that Rahman "deviled" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critic by blaming them for racism and Islam.
Rahman was said to be "the basis of his operational campaign that every religious Muslim had a religious obligation to vote on him".
Up to 300 voices were dubious or given harshly by the person voting by pretending to be another person.
According to Sir Eric, evidence of fraud was received from all over the country.
He expressed his particular concern at the post-election elections in which members of the Muslim community, who were told, were under pressure to vote on the candidate they elected.
Sir Eric (in the picture) made a number of proposals to clean up the voting system, including the requirement for a identity card at the polling site.
The report states: "There has been evidence that some members of vulnerable ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote at the will of older members, particularly in the Pakistani and Bangladesh-based communities."
"We were concerned that... state institutions had closed their eyes to this type of activity because of the 'politically correct' hypersensitivity to ethnic and religious hypersensitivity."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean the system, including banning the processing of postal tickets from political activists, in order to prevent 'harvesting of votes'.
The report under consideration by Theresa May also calls for stricter checks to be carried out in the context of registration in order to prevent the use of the register of voting rights for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consideration of options requiring voters to present an identity card before voting.
Immersion of fingers into an unsolicited muse after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure the nationality and voting rights of voters.
Setting a limit of three years for requests for an automatic postal vote.
Prohibiting political activists to handle full voice and voice envelopes sent by mail.
The police have the right to form security chains around the polling stations.
Amendment of the Act to make it easier to raise intimidation charges under the 'Representation of the People Act' of 1983 on the extension of voting rights.
Prohibiting photography at polling stations.
Only to allow English at polling stations (except Wales).
More effective training to ensure that staff are subject to a supervisory rule whereby only one person can go to the voting closet at a time.
Sir Eric is strongly critical of the London police and considers it "surprising" that, after the Tower Hamlet case, no criminal charges were brought.
"The election court expelled Lutfur Rahman and his representative from his role for corruption and numerous illegal practices," he says.
"He was found guilty without suspicion and the criminal law threshold was exceeded on many grounds."
He also criticises the inefficient 'corrosion checks' of the departments responsible for the electoral lists of the City Council.
"The judgment of the Court last year in the Tower Hamlet case was a wake-up call," says Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its heritage as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the worrying and covert electoral fraud of some people and the denial of it."
The similarity of the Olympic cyclist with the Duchess Catherine and the other twins in the Rio Olympics
The Rio 2016 Olympic fans were wild this week from Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, a French biker whose similarity with the Duchess of Cambridge is amazing.
But according to the discussions on social media, this 24-year-old Olympic representative is not the only sportsman fighting for the championship who has a similarity with a known person.
In honor of Rio and all the well-known faces in our screenplaying screens, FEMAIL compiled a list of all the Olympic representatives whose similarity with Hollywood celebrities is obvious.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellison (left) has been compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to the Duchess Catherine’s double-flying on bicycle tracks, many people have quoted in social media how an actor could be a favorite actor, Leonardo DiCaprio’s twin brother.
Brady Ellison, the U.S. Fleet Team of Men, caused a storm on Twitter after the images published about him, alarmingly reminding him of the star of Wolf of Wall Street.
Ellison was aware of the social media abuse and admitted that he had heard since he was a child that he looked like DiCaprio.
"I don't see a similarity so great, except for beards and mustaches," said Brady Huffington to the Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take this as a compliment."
In London 2012, the British long jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris were challenged, which is undoubtedly even more visible in these races.
Alyya Mustafina, a great-time Russian gymnast, has been called the double of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
On the other hand, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burghi has been compared with Matthew Morrison, who is known for the Glee TV series, for years now.
This user says Nathan Adrian is a "athletic version" of the Inception film actor.
Similarly, for a long time, there has been a listing of a similarity between a tennis star named Rafael Nadal and an actor named Josh Hartnett, emphasizing both powerful angles and lips.
The silver medalist of Uinn, Yulia Efimova, reminds the actress Annalynne McCord, not only because of her beautifully tanned skin and light hair, whereas Nathan Adrian of the U.S. team, according to his fans, is the "athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levit".
These two iron women, Hope Solo (left) and Jennifer Carpenter (right) in the Dexter series, remind each other of the shape and eyes of their faces.
Not only: this Twitter user was delighted when others also saw the similarity.
This user wonders if there's a good reason for a couple of similarities.
A twitter recently expressed its joy when "other people on the Internet agree with the similarities between Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter".
The American football star and Dexter series actor truly remind each other of their shape and eyes.
Many have also observed similarities in the smiles of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney and the gymnast Gabby Douglas who won gold and Anna Pala!
The Olympic Commander of the CBC is apologizing for the Chinese swimmer's "death like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place in women's 4 x 200-metre release message shocked CBC's direct Olympic viewers on Wednesday.
The Canadian broadcaster CBC has had to apologize since one of its commentators said 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "lost smell" and "dead as a pig" during the race.
Reporter Byron MacDonald thought his microphones were off when he started firing his own opinions at the end of the women's 4 x 200-metre release message.
MacDonald, who was included in CBC's reporting team, was heard as saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, he left fast, and he died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swim at the second part of 1:57.79 and remained 1.61 seconds from Taylor Ruck in Canada, which allowed the Canadians to swim in China.
The viewers around Canada react quickly after shocking the commentator’s tone and language.
Emmett Macfarlane says, "Did the CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig?"???
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air."
Ai Yanhani, a Chinese swimming in the finals of a women's 4 x 200-metre release message, was described in the following words: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter was quickly filled with the fierce comments by Byron MacDonald critical, and many demanded his resignation.
They didn't keep their words when they heard Byron Macdonald's disregard.
Twiittaja Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us all sound racist.
Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC mission, quickly regretted the statements made by MacDonald: "We apologize for the comments made on swimming performance.
It was a unfortunate choice of words, and we regret that this happened."
In the end, CBC had to apologize more than 90 times for people who had twitted in response to the comment.
Scott Russel, commenting colleague, had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
The CBC then copied and glued its regret to more than 90 other twitters' comments, which complained about MacDonald’s speeches.
The TV company also quickly made a public apology.
"We are sincerely sorry, these statements and that they were sent.
At last night's broadcast, we quickly apologized to our viewers, and we also apologized to our social media followers.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was unfortunate, and Byron is very sorry for what he said."
On Thursday night, MacDonald expressed his regret at the broadcast and tried to defend his speech by saying that he did not mean it in person.
"I want to apologize for my comment that I gave last night after the women's message-switching," MacDonald said at the Olympic mission of the CBC.
"I was referring to a swimmer's performance, not a person.
It goes without saying that I did not mean anything with my words defamatory, and I am very sorry."
In Primark, the woman in the middle of the store was shocking customers by preventing underwear.
The clients didn't know where to look when the woman took off in the middle of Primark to make up for underwear.
He further aggravated the situation by assessing what he looked like in his underwear, taking them off and putting them back on the shelf.
He continued his tour and eventually tried four pair of underpants at the shop at Bouverie Place in Folkeston.
The Primark store at the Folkestonen Bouverie Place, where the woman tried her underwear in front of everyone and put them back on the shelf.
Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children at the same time, at the same time, at the same time, says that after experimenting with underwear, an unknown woman dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He tells us about what happened: "People had no faith in their eyes.
She stood in the middle of the store, took her underwear off the shelf, took off her own girdles and underwear, and put them on.
He did not try to do it unnoticed, but did it without any shame.
Everyone was staring when he took the underwear he tried off and apparently didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf.
He did it three more times before he finally decided he didn’t like anything, dress, and walk out.
He didn’t seem to care for the looks — nor thought of the person who would eventually buy the underwear he had taken.”
The 33-year-old Davidson, living in Kenttown, goes on to say, "How disgusting to think someone's taking home the underwear that someone else has been wearing and not washed."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
"I have understood that the shop staff sought to remove the pieces of clothing in question from the sale when the woman had left – what is right.
It would be terrible to take new underwear home and notice that someone else has taken them without having washed them after that," adds Davidson.
Primark’s informant commented: “Prmark will be aware on Tuesday 9 August of the situation in Folkestone’s movement.
All the products in question have been removed from the market."
This is how you defend yourself against armed assault with the help of Krav Maga.
The world is full of dangers, but this video from Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed the Grand Master of the Krav Mage in New York, Rhon Mizrach, and asked how to cope with a robbery or assaulter at a distance.
The video shows how you can defend yourself against the attacker according to whether the attacker is approaching you from behind or against you.
If the attacker approaches the rear, the first thing you need to do is turn around so you can see the attacker and get off the firing line, says Mizrachi.
After this, hold the gun between your elbow and shoulder, and strike the attacker in your face with your free elbow.
Then kick the assailant on the knee, and when he goes through pain twice, slap him on the face with a gun and turn around and keep the gun pointing at him.
The technique is similar if the armed attacker approaches the front. You need to move away from the firing line, grab the weapon and rotate it so that the attacker can't fire.
At the same time, place your weight in the gun and hit the attacker with a fist in the chest. Turn the gun away from the attacker’s grip, retreat and hold the weapon against the attacker.
Does that sound difficult?
Watch Mizrachi do it on video.
Remember, however, that the safest way to get rid of the robber by giving up your cash – unless you are the Grandmaster of Krav Mag.
World Traveler Ian Wright licks Europe's dirtiest places
The British traveler put his resistance and demise reflex on a hard test by licking Europe's dirtiest and most disgusting places.
Suffolk host and tour guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove the strength of his resistance by licking the euro banknote, the handrail in Piccadilly Circle, the WCWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW WW
Before licking, Wright measured the targets by a luminometer to see for himself and to show the viewers where his tongue was pushing.
Documentary film Ian Wright was made of the experiment, and its results were surprising.
The idea of licking the sink in the train’s toilet can be disgusting, but in fact more bacteria are in the kitchen sink.
On his journey to different parts of Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals to strengthen good bacteria in the intestines and their own health.
Fortunately, nothing that he licked caused anything but a bad mouth.
Ian Wright was originally known for his travel program, where he tested the endurance of his intestines by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
No doubt the licking of the handrails of railway stations and the toilet spraying switch challenged Wright's ability to resist.
Wright says in the document, "I've been quite careless about my health since I was a kid, and I've put all kinds of things in my mouth, like soil, worms and dirt."
In a movie, he really showed himself to be equal to his reputation.
The border met only in a congested public toilet in Russia.
The luminometer measured over 4,000 units from the sample.
In view of the comparison, it should be stated that the number in the newly washed hands is usually less than 60.
The border met in a common Russian toilet, where Wright refused to lick when the luminometer measured 4000 units — in the opposite hands the same figure is less than 60.
Wright adventures in a documentary film produced with Valio, Ian Wright – After inner strength, where the number of bacteria can be seen in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the document, "This is almost the worst smell I've ever smelled in a bathroom.
Four thousand units, nothing's dirtier than that one!
The place is so disgusting, I really don't lick anything here."
Wright produced a documentary on Ian Wright – an inner power trail in cooperation with Valio.
Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, was given by Wright to help strengthen the good intestinal bacterial status and resistance.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Head of the Valio snack, juice and novelty category products says: "We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that's fascinating to see and at the same time tells us about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time trying to think of something crazy, and finally we came up with the idea of asking for Ia."
The health of the intestine has become a global trend.
Instead of simply talking about products, we wanted to bring them into a wider context and tell them about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to resistance.
The health of the intestine has become a global trend, and the document allows us to give consumers more information about it in an interesting way.
The film also tells us about our sense of humor!"
The film directed by Tom Hakala adds: "Let's say that I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked certain of the items we asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet, which is also shown in the film.
Naturally, it was easier for Ian to lick some items, while some were rather bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty arrows on the tape."
In a questionnaire carried out in 2015, 84% of respondents added lactic acid bacteria to the well-being of the abdomen and intestines, and 58% reported that they had used at least occasionally products with added lactic acid bacteria.
The family destroyed the city-owned rental house in Saltash, Cornwall.
The family left 50 000 pounds of damage to the city’s rental house after they had been evicted for terrorism in the neighborhood.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband, Shaun Trebilcock, have been evicted from their apartment in Cornwall Saltash since numerous complaints against the couple.
When the couple had been forced out of the apartment, the representatives of the rental housing company were shocked to find the apartment in repair condition.
In the walls there were vehement openings, the floor boxes were torn off, the trash was spread to the floors, and the walls were stunned with graffiti.
The couple have now changed, and they are believed to live in a private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, Head of Cornwall Housing, says that she is afraid that the apartment may no longer be saved.
He says, "This has been a total nightmare for people living here, no one should have to put up with this.
There is much to weigh, since the property is likely to be known as not so pleasant as part of Cornwall.
"The family is infamous, as is its name."
The couple had three boys living in the apartment from time to time. According to the police, the family's atrocities included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of local residents, drug use and transmission, and loud screaming, quarreling and cursing.
In June, 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the lease agreement, received a non-social behaviour order.
In several rooms of the house under the shower, old waste was found.
The house had been sold in the past, and the floors had been torn off.
According to the neighbors, the family fought on the street and the police had to make regular calls.
Cornwall’s housing agency forced the couple this week, giving them 11 weeks to move away voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors were grateful for the eviction — they said that their lives were hell on earth.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We've been living next door to them for 20 years, and this whole time has been hard.
The police have been here incredibly many times."
"This morning, we couldn't sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we're not used to it!
It will be wonderful now that they have finally been evicted."
Adam Fitzpatrick, director of the forced enforcement of Cornwall Housing Office, reports that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which the police were regularly invited.
The trash and old toys had been thrown on the wildly wall of the rental house.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It is a shame that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his or her family's behaviour, for eviction is always the last measure that Cornwall's housing office will consider.
This case was very difficult because behavior was extreme and their actions must have been shocking for the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my working group, Mr Devon and Mr Cornwall, and to the members of the community who took part in the work and offered to give us information.
I hope that this progress will improve the well-being of our neighbours and send out a message that non-social behaviour is not acceptable."
Fitzpatrick says that the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but they were already twenty.
The dirty mattress found in one of the bedrooms after the eviction
Housing workers now have to clean out the waste bins around the house.
In 2014, the police made a raid and found over 70 grams of cannabis and other equipment and 1 700 pounds of cash.
Skeldon was fined for being found guilty of possession of class B drugs to sell it.
He claimed that the money was for his son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, Skeldon and his husband have been heard to move into a private apartment in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were mutilated with graffiti.
The police say they're calling for an eviction of tenants who break the rules of the leases.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall Police say that this eviction is a clear warning to tenants who constantly violate the rules.
"This is a clear message for those who think they can behave how they want to do without charges, as well as for those who suffer from this type of behaviour," says Crow.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never accept criminal and non-social behaviour and will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Low-flying, beach-stamped army jet scared tourists in Portugal
Sun worshipers experienced the shock of their lives in the Portuguese Aveiro.
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force crashed to a very small level.
According to the Air Forces, this was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The picture shows the moment when tourists were panicking when a low - flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic images show how an army plane becomes almost full of touch on a sandy beach for tourists taking the sun in the Aveiro of Northern Portugal.
The vacationers rose to their feet, worrying, understandably about the sound of jet engines that began to belong before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the images and videos of the dramatic passing on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who says, "It passed the beach twice, and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash."
Nuno Arroja adds: "I was surfing and I was sure the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on the shore of Aveiro experienced shock when the plane suddenly appeared and flew at an alarming low level.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight designed to identify coastal fishing vessels and therefore had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly a little lower than normal, because smoke caused by nearby forest fires was detrimental to visibility, but according to the Air Forces, this did not threaten the safety of anyone.
Forest fires have caused destruction in parts of continental Portugal and have killed four people on Madeira Island.
Today, the Portuguese Air Force announced that due to the bad visibility caused by the dusk fog and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The aircraft was on a training flight where the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels.
The result of the first half of the year is better than expected.
The South Karelian Social and Health District (Eksote) produced a better result of EUR 3.4 million than planned in June.
The result of the exot was EUR 4.3 million in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where preventive services have been developed to bring down institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all operations.
This year, the Exote will seek to shorten the course of action.
The extremism covers the deficit previously created by the surplus.
The remaining proportion may be used to shorten lines and to buy measures for patients.
The total annual result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The government will discuss the six-monthly review at its meeting next Wednesday.
Immola, 70 special border icers sweared on the military whale.
Of the 70 backup officers at the Border and Marine Guard School, they swore a military whale on Friday.
A military election of the guards of the Border and Maritime Guard School took place in Immola on Friday.
The Tenth Special Border Jäger Course was held in the backup sports field.
The military whale swore 70 deputies.
Special border guards are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for a special border ice cream.
They were invited to the selection tests at 250.
Special frontiers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans from the border forces during the war were involved in the campaign.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
Veterans who took part in the event were born in 1918.
To a limited extent of looting ahead, criminal intelligence will help investigate and expose serious crime - ESS.fi
Each of the 11 Finnish police agencies has been operating as of the beginning of 2014 a RTA, i.e. a criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible to the outside.
In the Hämeen Police Department, the unit includes a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's drawn by a sergeant stationed in Lahti.
The chief of staff is in charge of Lieutenant Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in a civilian suit.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and need, sees Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides various explanations to the other police.
In confusion, for example, it has obtained information from asylum seekers.
The most recent reform of working methods
The establishment of analytical units is the most recent reform of police practices.
The aim was to prevent crime, i.e. to make it less and less frequent for the police to leave the wars only when the alarm is received.
The information collected and analysed by the unit is used to target day-to-day police activities where they are most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, a criminal intelligence centre was set up, less than three national units, and each police department had its own criminal intelligence unit.
The PTR centre in Vantaa, in connection with the Central Crime Police, will lead the activities at national level.
PTRs employ people from the police, from Customs and Border Guards, according to their name.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in divided areas, and their role is to provide information to both local police and national authorities.
Intelligence extends beyond its territory
Where an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, it is up to the RTA unit to know what is going on throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the limits of its own institution, because crime does the same.
Those who work in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
Through registers, an alert mission database and observations, the unit aims to draw the police's attention to new phenomena, productive crimes or crimes that resemble each other.
This is called serialisation, and it is one of the most important tools for criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it is honest or criminal.
Based on the practice, the author is a certain image.
The recording can be done either on the basis of a method of action or by a person, depending on which police officer has more information.
Criminals Learn From Errors
The employees of the RTA unit do not travel around the city with collars, but their work is not fully public either.
There is no report of the methods used by both the individual and the criminal, since it could lead to the development of professional criminal activities and thus to the prevention of police criminal activity.
The police publicly report these practices if they expect them to pose a threat.
For example, such a case was reported from the early summer, the mode of subscription of empty dwellings used for housing fractures.
That's where the people put the stick, pin or tape on the outside door, and they tried to see if the residents were really on their way.
The preliminary investigation material shall be made public at least to the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals are learning from their mistakes.
The smartest order are the District Court protocol, which shows, for example, that fingerprints have been found.
The next time we go to the thieves, we're going to get our gloves on.
The case has been interviewed by Deputy Police Commissioner Tero Seppa from Hämee Police, Lieutenant Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärve from Joensuu Police Station and Criminal Inspector Arto Tuomela from Central Criminal Police.
Police collect and analyse information to plan practical action.
In the background of a reduction in labour and financial resources.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was the three-step PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside its own institution and the Finnish borders.
The London schoolgirl who joined Daddy was killed in Syria.
News reports that one of the three British school students who joined Isis last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Counsellor Tasname Akunjee tells the girl's family that Sultana died in Syria a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in the Russian air strike at Raqqa, an Isis base in Syria, reported ITV News on Thursday.
The sultana was 17 years old, and according to her family, she was planning to escape from the war and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that this will serve as a warning example and as a will, so that people will understand this as a real risk when they go to war - and who will make people give up the decision to leave," says Akunyee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other Austrian schoolgirls boarded a plane to Turkey and continued to travel by bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married an Isis fighter in Syria only a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland's appointment to the Supreme Court if he's elected.
Mr Reid, democratic leader of the Senate, said that he is convinced that Mr Hillary Clinton, the candidate for democratic president, will appoint Mr Merrick Garland as judge of the Supreme Court if he is elected President.
The Republican representatives of the Senate have not agreed to confirm Garland's appointment since Barack Obama appointed him in March.
According to the Senate's majority leader, Mitch McConnell, the next president will elect the person to fill the seat of Judge Anton Scalia of the late Supreme Court.
In a phone conference on Thursday, Reid said that he predicted Clinton's choice of Garland's "almost with great certainty".
Reid’s informant later specified that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly to Clinton whether or not he was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "roll the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the Supreme Judge of the United States Court of Appeal in Columbia County.
Reid says the Republicans who are blocking Garland's appointment are the Presidential candidate Donald Trump's "commandees" and "promotors".
He says Trump doesn't fit in.
According to the Treats magazine, naked calendars are as good for women as for men.
Treats magazine cooperates with photographer David Bellemere and launches a 1970s-style calendar for 2017 inspired by Pirelli.
They want to find the top models for the next generation of their 2017 NU Mus calendar instead of the public secret.
Treats CEO Steve Shaw told me earlier this year that his nude newspaper differs from the old school Playboy magazine, because he says, "Playboy is for men.
I'm doing this to women."
Apparently, he thinks the same thing about the calendar.
"We must bring back timeless and classic nudity, where women, wherever men, can enjoy and inspire these images of the female body," says Shaw's calendar press release.
"Women certainly want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful work of art."
The template for the calendar can be sent online or participate in open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl charm: Who buys records?
Single, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you have time to write a comment on the name of your angry objection NoiväAll Individual Men of the Middle Ages, this argument is based on actual research data.
According to YouGov, the new arrival of high-profile vinyl plates is not a millennial-generation boom, when the millennials want to know the physical object, but rather the middle-age nostalgic.
The person who recently bought the vinyl album is most likely to be between 45 and 54.
In fact, age groups 18-24 are the least likely buyers.
It is also not just a fan's desire to score discs, but the importance is emotional: older buyers of vinyl plates are more likely to keep their feelings hidden (56% versus 53%) and enjoy solitude (69% versus 66%).
But is the results of YouGov true?
If this blog were a television newscast, the camera would follow me on my way through the lively Soho Street, wearing an unpretentious gray jacket. I would keep my eyes shut, bend my hand into a cup and say something about tradition, like, "Let's be clear."
So let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and fragility, when hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over pre-owned premises by private entrepreneurs, however, there are still a handful of special plate stores.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment when I'm applying very close to visiting men in these stores and I'm trying to assess their age and character.
The Glasgow Stuart, 55, followed by two young women, three middle-aged men, from Sister Ray at the time of the meeting (at that time eight middle-aged men, one of the most likely twenty-year-old women) are on a meeting trip to London during the afternoon and spends their extra time looking at the supply of shops.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
"I think I am," he says.
"I have about 3,000 to 4,000 records."
These records fill his living room walls, as shown in the picture. (Stuart sent me a picture by email, I did not follow him home.)
The reason why he has acquired so many albums and singles is partly available to him in his incomes. He now has the ability to buy records that he could not afford when they initially appeared, and to buy again the things he had to sell when he was young and broke.
"I'm working on a lot of things in the late '60s and early '70s that showed up when I was 11 or 12 years old and probably too young to have them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy vinyl plates are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their company and adds, "I don't smoke, and I don't drink much.
It's a bad thing."
Wez, 25 working at Sister Ray, also believes that many of their customers match the YouGov profile.
However, he has discovered a new kind of human stream that has been affected by the media hypnosis. These people have heard about the coming of vinyl plates again and now feel compelled to buy back their old records.
"According to my discussions, people had generally abandoned their collections in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyls to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy back their vinyls," he says.
This may explain the boom of certain ages.
What, then, about the alleged emotional meaning of the recordings?
Only in a few seconds will you realize in a movement such as Phonica that they offer a comforting community for the same - souled people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers are particularly upset with the contactless payment system.
The digital world may be puzzled by some of the vinyl fans, for whom the return to familiar disk cases means permanence and reminds us of the happy days of youth.
"I think it sometimes fills a hole or acquires tangible property for some kind of comfort," says Wez.
"I saw it as a collector myself, and I believe that so do many others.
It's an easy way to get your thoughts elsewhere."
"We are like social workers!" boasted Wez's co-worker from behind the record.
The April ICM survey revealed that almost 50% of those who bought the vinyl album in the previous month had not yet listened to their album.
The opinion poll also said that 41% are a disc player that they never use, and 7% of those who buy a vinyl plate do not have a single player at all.
At this point, I'd probably be looking like a serious face, while I'm making some stacked bossa nova collections.
The new arrival of vinyl plates is also accompanied by the "pokal phenomenon", which has been observed by Jonny, the salesman of the Sounds of the Universe (at the time three middle-aged men) 42.
"A certain customer recently came into circulation and said he didn't have a record player, but he wants to buy a radiohead, so he can put it on his shelf," Jonny says.
"The share of such customers is not high, but they are.
For them, materiality is more important than music.
Some of our clients say they don't have a record player yet.
They are younger, no parents, mostly teenagers, who are just starting a hobby."
The customer company is much more varied in Foppi, where I come next. The store has dedicated a whole layer to vinyl plates.
Customers include 70-year-old couples, photographers, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in previous moves, the latest synthetic poppy of Wild Beasts, instead of the jazz of the ringing, delights in the diversity of customers.
None of the clients seem to be very lonely, but it's hard to tell by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Foppi for a few minutes and watching various discounted discs.
He's more than just looking at shopping.
He says his income is low, so he can't collect records.
"They cost a lot of money.
Music is easy to listen to from your computer or otherwise, but the fineness of the wine is ...", he lets a lovely sigh and continues:
"I can't explain, they're so unique."
My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I see a bunch of teenage girls who would think they'd be bouncing jeans, but who instead gather around the Polaroid cameras for a while, and I see a father and daughter who were thinking about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left there is a stairs filled with the wall of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of modern music and classics, key records for any average collection.
No one looks at the wall, maybe because they're just an interior and part so high that they don't even reach them.
They're pure "art vinyl" interior.
However, given that all the means to get attention to these records may mean more money for the industry and send some customers on a search trip to Soho, there is little reason to complain.
It is no surprise that the population group, which most likely has more time and money than most people, is also the group that spends most money on luxury, such as vinyl plates.
Although the results of my studies are true, at least in Soho’s record stores, they do not exclude a large number of female collectors and vinyl fans that actually exist both in record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely attached to school or working life.
I'm sure they don't spend their Thursday mornings macing Berwick Street's record stores, browsing records and avoiding 30-year-olds who act as a TV joker, staring intimidatingly and looking at unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holker is the longest living vertebrate – video report
According to scientists, the longest vertebrate living on earth is an ice shark.
According to the pancreatic researcher Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice sharks in the study reached 272-512 years of age, a female of five metres long.
The French court rejected the application for the landing of the jungle camp’s shops
The French court has rejected the application of the Calais authorities for the landing of dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle camp by thousands of refugees.
In the course of the proceedings this week, the Calais authorities made claims that the state should be authorised to break down 72 temporary trades established for refugee camps, selling different types of tobacco to the residents of the refugee camp and offering hair cuts, which can be bought at temporary restaurants for 50 cents or for a few euros of basic meals.
According to the Calais Prefects, these shops and restaurants need to be demolished because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent a grey economy and because they are accompanied by fire and hygiene.
The humanitarian aid groups told the court that shops and restaurants are necessary for the camp, as free meals provided by a government - sponsored organization and other bodies are not enough for an ever growing population of the camp.
They say that temporary shops and restaurants often provide protection and free food for those in need.
The Court of Justice ruled that there was no legal basis for the deportation of 72 temporary traders, but considered the concerns of the Calais Prefect "to be fully understandable".
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, the camp’s food shops, cafes and restaurants have a much greater significance than just providing food to people who “live in extremely unstable conditions”.
He says they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteer workers can meet each other.
One of the places under the threat of decommission was the Jungle Book Kids café, which is unprofitable and offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons and asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable minors.
More than 170 000 people have signed an address where children’s cafe is required to be preserved.
According to a letter sent to Guardian, closing it would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old.
On Friday, two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated that since the sharp increase in the number of arrivals in the summer, the number of inhabitants of the jungle camp has risen to record over 9 000 lives.
Food prices fall significantly faster in Finland than in the EU average
Food is greatly cheaper in Finland for the benefit of consumers and the harm of producers.
In Finland, food prices have fallen by almost five per cent in three years, while in the EU on average their prices have fallen by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become 1% more expensive.
Over the last three years, food prices have fallen most in Finland from the EU countries with the same wage level as in Finland.
In Britain alone, food prices have fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are presented in the article by Ilkka Lehtinen, Director of Development of Statistics Finland, which was published in the Tieto & Trendit blog.
The magazine compared real prices, i.e. prices, with the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest data will be from June this year.
At the beginning of the 2010s, food prices increased sharply.
In 2013, prices fell close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came from EU membership," says Lehtinen.
Then there followed a turn, after which food has become cheaper year after year.
The bans on food imports imposed by Russia are now pressing the price, which has brought down food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and producer prices for agriculture have fallen.
“Putin’s policy has helped Finnish consumers in a short term,” says Lehtinen.
The increased price competition between industry and trade has also affected the fall in price.
Big chains of trade S-Group and Kesko have both dropped their prices.
For consumers, price competition has appeared to be outstanding advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not a place for affordable food, even though the food price has fallen greatly.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland in the EU, with a wage level similar to that in Finland.
According to Lehtinen, VAT is significantly affected by the price of food sold in Finland.
He found that if the analogue countries had the same VAT rate, Finland would sell the third cheapest food from similar countries.
The magazine compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate was seven in the comparative countries, only Germans and Dutch people would sell more cheap food than Finns.
"If we want to be able to reach the old EU countries at the price of food, we need to halve the value added tax to the EU countries' average level and continue to compete", Lehtinen writes.
The paper points out that the calculations he has made at the rate of the VAT rate are indicative.
School isn't quite the same anymore.
A person returning to school may find that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guide for all schools in Finland to operate.
Schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan sets out the official objectives.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from old ones in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of fiction is abandoned, and schools start to practice coding.
Swedish education starts in the sixth grade at the latest, and social education starts in four.
However, the greatest change concerns the role of students.
It used to be thought that a teacher teaches students, but now everyone has to be active and learn one another from another.
This is the way of trying to make school more interesting.
The world's longest vertebrate was found - an ice shark can live for up to 400 years
The well-known Greenlandese shark (Somniosus microcephalus) reaches sexual maturity only at 150 years of age.
It can live another 250 years after that, report a new study.
The figures make the species the longest vertebrate of today’s world.
In the animal, it is only passed by an Icelandic imposter whose oldest known individual has been scheduled to be 507.
Greenland sharks swim along the North Atlantic.
They also have a second record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
The females stretch the dogs longer, they can grow up to five feet [5 m].
Because the rate of growth is slow, it is estimated that only about a centimetre a year, adults have lived for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He determined the age of adult icefish of 28 females who had remained in the fishing gears.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radiocarbon sequelae of the eye lenses.
The mean age of treated sharks was at least 272 years.
The two largest fishes in the sample, 493 and 502 centimeters, were exposed to approximately 335 years of age and 392 years of age.
In view of the fact that in previous studies it has been found that there are only more than four metres of sexual maturity for the pedigree, the researchers calculated that they were about 150 years old at that stage.
Science published the study.
Stockmann fires almost 300 people. No salesmen are reduced.
Almost 300 employees are dismissed from Stockman, a department store.
Co-operative companies in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of the tie-ups, approximately 300 jobs are reduced, most of which will be made redundant," Stockmann explains in his bulletin.
It does not mean that the number of retailers in the goods sector will be reduced so that the customer service does not suffer.
In addition, some 80 workers in support functions are offered new jobs as a seller.
Stockmann's yt negotiations concerned some 3,000 workers.
At the beginning, it was estimated that there would be around 380 employees.
The reduction of the population is aimed at annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are due to take place next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
Stockmann's difficulties in getting profitable from the department store.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11,1 million in the second quarter, trade in goods remains a loss.
In Stockmann’s view, Lauri Veijalainen, CEO, said that sales in the goods sector have not reached the objectives set by the company.
"Personal reductions are unfortunately necessary to ensure the positive operating result of Stockmann Retail in 2018," Veijalainen says in the release.
In the second quarter, the result improvement was particularly driven by the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
Ketju achieved the best turnover and results for the second quarter of all time.
Lindex's operating profit increased to EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
Last year, the total operating result of Stockmann Group was 4.1 million in loss.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year will decrease last year.
The revised operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperature below 20 degrees throughout the country
The low pressure centre on the north of Finland will keep the weather rain on Friday, says Ilona Lag, meteorologist of HS.
There are also rainfalls in the middle of the country, but the southern part is vermin.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as mercury remains below 20 degrees throughout the country.
The northern rain areas remain at 10-15 degrees.
Kenya’s sports team is shaken by a strange explanation of the doping scandal at the coach’s pace.
Kenyan sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it became apparent that Anzrah appeared as a country team athlete in the doping test.
The news agency AP reported that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is a 800 - meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya’s National Team Command, told us that Anzrah’s identity was revealed after he gave a sample in the surprise test as Rotichina.
Doping officials reported to the Anzrah authorities.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because he was "prosecuting Kenya's country team".
He performed as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour", President of the Kenya Olympic Committee, Kip Keino, on the other hand, would hang on to the news agency Reuters.
The Olympics’ sport begins on Friday, and Rothish is scheduled to run immediately at that time.
It is not yet known whether there are known consequences for the runner.
Rotich placed last year in the World Cup on the way to the fourth and is ahead of Rio's winners.
According to Reuters, the source inside Kenya's sports team claimed that Anzrah was driving the athlete's accreditation card only to get free meals in the racing village.
When the antidoping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid to be exposed," the source told.
Where is everybody?
The Rio Sports Platform is rubbering its emptyness
Where is everybody?
Not at the Rio Olympic Stadium, at least, watching sports.
In Rio on Friday, a struggle started on the medals of sport, but the world’s top individuals were allowed to present their skills to an unscrupulous empty audience.
Rio’s organisers reported on Friday that only 58 percent of the first day’s morning tickets and 65 percent of the night’s tickets were sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium was bubbling about cheering people.
The finals' tickets are already sold out in Rio.
The Rio Olympic Loss has attracted attention even before sports.
For example, thousands of empty seats have been seen in the views of rugby, melonna, and horse riding.
When the Brazilian medallions Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the scene was filled.
After the Brazilian double, the Netherlands played against Russia, and 12 000 people were only filled with about 30 percent.
The bad moves are at least explained by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with economic problems, is a long way off for European and Asian competitionists, and many of the Olympics are strange for Brazilians who are used to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team could not have filled the football stadium.
Mario Andrada, informant of the contestants, told us that 82 per cent of the tickets had been sold at that time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million left to sell," said Andrada, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets of the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, although the tickets cost nearly half as much as Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have ranged from around EUR 9 to over EUR 1 000 for openings.
More than half of the tickets cost less than EUR 16.
At the Summer Olympics in London, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but this is not yet allowed in Rio, because organisers need money and are trying to get tickets sold until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organisers have given 240 000 tickets to less well - known species, such as golf and rugby, to schoolchildren in the country.
In Rio Stadium, there were plenty of empty places in the morning.
Even on the sand of the beach volleyball Copacabana, the audience has not been interested.

A new way to protect the environment - acquire the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation by means of new ways.
The Foundation established last year acquires ecologically significant natural sites.
After that, private, companies and entities can redeem their rights to land with money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land has been distributed virtually into blocks which those who wish to acquire rights against payment.
The holder obtains a veto in the size of 187 square blocks, which in practice means that every holder is not required to be approved if the use of the land is to be changed.
You can also acquire custody rights in several areas.
Acquisition of a right of administration is something concrete that can be left to an inheritance or given as a gift.
There is no need to go and carry banners or chain yourself to a place to protect nature," says Juha Levia fabric, who has acquired control over his company.
The acquirer obtains accurate location information from his or her branch, which allows for, for example, a visit to the section.
On the Foundation's website, the name of the acquirers of the right-holders will be found in the same map where the land block data can be found.
The only risk that the Foundation’s activities will change from its original idea is that it is protected by the bread fabric.
The Helsinki Foundation has been set up as a foundation of general interest to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the Foundation would operate in some way ethically or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation's Fairy project is the protection of natural habitats so that they can be intact and at peace.
The Foundation acquires land either by buying or by making donations.
It is mainly financed by the sale of ownership rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The aim of the Foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims beyond Finland's borders and plans to register from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in pop up forest at Helsinki shopping market on 13-19 August.
The cyclists torture the big cities of Turku the worst - see the situation in your municipality.
Cycling thieves torture Turku, one of the biggest cities in Finland.
This year, more wheels have been stolen in proportion to the population than in nine other major cities.
Helsingin Sanomat explained to the police the extent to which the ten largest cities have stolen bicycles and parts of bicycles per thousand inhabitants in the January to August of this year.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to the police, out of four to five bicycle thieves per thousand inhabitants.
Instead, only about two bicycle thieves per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police in Espoo and Kouvola.
It's a big difference.
"There are twice as many thefts in other cities as there are others," explains Tommi Reen, police inspector of the police department.
Turku's police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer to that.
“The frequency of threats can be influenced by the number of bikes in the city and the number of wheels in the city,” says Sergeant Teemu Kiäs.
Tommi Reen, the police government, is looking forward to the fact that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu are up to the top in comparison.
The number of bicycle thefts goes much further than the number of study and cycling cities.
Turku has a dense center, short distances and lots of wheels available for thieves.
"E.g. Espoo is a completely different type of city, where city centres are distant from each other and bicycles are not necessarily a priority vehicle," Reen says.
In the whole of Finland, there have been slightly less bicycle thefts in January to August than in the corresponding period of last year.
But there's no reason for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, the police report a little over 20,000 bicycle thefts per year.
It means 50 to 60 fillets every day, and only in Helsinki about 4,000 bikes per year.
"They're large quantities," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more wheels, for only some victims report theft to the police.
Reen calls on people to report the theft of a bicycle, although fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police can be found.
A typical solved wheel theft is where the police get information about the theft right away and the thief gets caught in blood.
"There are also other cases in the course of another investigation, where, for example, a drug case can find stolen wheels in the apartment," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bicycle thieves are caught on a weekly basis in the course of work or police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, wheels are stolen from bicycles, courtyards, warehouses and wheelchairs in shopping centres, for example, practically everywhere they are usually stored.
The most isolated bicycle models are stolen as in previous years.
The U-lock gives the wheel a better protection than many other types of lock.
Some thieves take the bike, for example, for their own short-term use, but a large part of the stolen wheels end up for sale on the Internet, for example.
They'll stay on the domestic market.
"At least it's not known to the police that a lot of stolen wheels are going abroad," Reen says.
According to the police, shoppers of stolen wheels are ordinary Finns.
Some of them must be buying a stolen bike without knowing.
Some may have doubts about that.
The buyer of the used bike must be careful, for he or she may be guilty of a disguised crime or offence.
"The alarm clocks should ring if the good-art bikes are sold down," Reen says.
Special librarian Sever Hirvi carries his colorful Nops for all his working days to protect the Kallio library in Helsinki.
He's had five wheels, but no one's been stolen, says. "Never been taken, there's been a good monk."
"It may not be so attractive to the thieves; there may not be a hipster value here," the Helsinki Hurvi wonders.
In the Kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, Sioni Valve locked his bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now, the bike was sitting against the wall of the Kiosk, but usually Valve is locking his bike in something solid, like a wheel rack.
"There will be quite a lot to think about, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," says the Helsinki student on her white bike, whose body alone cost about EUR five hundred.
"The whole time you hear from your friends that the wheels have been taken."
"mostly bad wheels, like scum jops."
A bike was stolen from the guard from the inside of the building company a year ago.
Although the wheel had not been locked up, Valve was waiting to catch it.
Under 15 years of age to be held responsible for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer-reviewing teams from the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer-review team is being tested to prevent young people from entering the crime scene.
At first, the experiment will apply to people under 15 years of age who are now without criminal liability.
The peer review team is missing the first young person to commit a crime.
The idea is that the peer review team will discuss what happened with the offender and impose sanctions.
A week later, the offender may himself join the peer review team to make up for his actions.
There may be other consequences, for example, of a letter written to the family explaining what has become done and what has been learned from it.
The youth director, Tommi Laitoo, says that the model is not strict.
We have other compromise models that are used alongside.
"All are directed towards a more responsible course of action of a young person, so that everything is not ruined by the first mistake," says the Department.
A model of the United States of America has been adopted on the peer-review team, where it is widely used.
The idea is that the young person, after his first crime, will not be exposed to an adult panel, but will reflect on what has happened with approximately the same age.
They've tried the model once.
The service designer Iikka Lovio of Palmu, who followed the experiment, reported that it was an abuse that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes committed by people under 15 have not necessarily been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message to continue on the road you chose," Lovio says.
The peer-review team is part of the Helsinki project of immigrant youth, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new approaches are offered to all those in need, not just young immigrants.
More than 70 Republicans want the party to stop financing Trump's campaign.
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop financing Donald Trump's presidential election campaign.
The letter was published by the U.S. newspaper Politico, who had got it to see the draft.
According to the press, the open letter is addressed to the President of the Republican National Committee, Mr Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to be directed to Congressionals instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump and his disregard, incompetence and record disapprovals threaten to bring a tone to the Democrats in these elections," says the letter according to Politico.
Only the direct allocation of all possible funds to the Congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning with Trump-enhanced anchor in their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election are falling day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is due to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the persons organized by the letter is apparently Republican Andrew Weinstein who opposes Trump.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from 'people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress' and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists a number of Donald Trump’s acts, which are believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he was said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for U.S. families with children
In the United States, Mr Hillary Clinton, the candidate for democratic president, told us about the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I am trying to be president so that the US economy can go well for everyone.
"Clinton said in his speech, Donald Trump seeks to be president, so that the economy can go well for him and his friends."
At the centre of the Clinton plan is a massive five-year programme of $275 billion to improve US infrastructure, bridges and airports.
This would be partly financed by rich tax increases, partly by private money.
The building program is a hand-hold for the American dounars who suffer from the move of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme the largest investment in good paid jobs after World War II.
We are a builder, we must return to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of working families with children.
On Thursday, she sounded like Sanders, stressing that the rich should pay a fair share of the taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States for tax-retirement, it'll have to pay the tax, then Clinton said.
Today he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he used to support.
"As President, I am against any trade agreement that acts against employees or wages," Clinton promised.
According to the speculations published by The Washington Post before Clinton's speech, Clinton intended to criticise the economic program published by Republican Donald Trump on Monday for "responsible only millionaires of this type".
The scrape proposed by Trump to corporate tax has previously been called "Trump loophole" by Clinton.
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded the audience of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has failed to pay, and the clothes Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start making his own products in America," Clinton poked.
These are the Rio ratings: The competitions have not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile application is of interest to
Usually, sports races are shown in television viewer statistics as the sharpest mountain peaks.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not reached extreme numbers of viewers.
On one occasion, at best 12 per cent of the population has been glued to the screens: on Tuesday night, Ylen's swimming was followed by 615 000 viewers from the Olympic Channel TV2 at the same time.
For comparisons: the EM competitions of general sport, one month ago, attracted nearly 800 000 viewers to TV2 at a time, and the EM competitions of football were quite another million.
So far, the Olympics have been most interested in cycling Sunday night and the fifth day of the race, both of which reached almost half a million viewers at one time.
The top sports chief, Panu Pokkinen, is pleased with the ratings and reminds us that, for the first time in the Rio Olympics, the viewers are divided into several different instruments.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympics from Rio Arena.
We are pleased to see how much TV viewers choose the Olympic Games in general.
On the side of TV, even the viewers share TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports competitions Yle has dedicated a whole channel to.
When the shipment arrives 24 hours a day and the viewers are from 20 000 to 500 000 all the time, it is a good base.
The number of viewers is smaller than in 2012 London or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is explained in part by the time difference - a large proportion of the shipments in Rio will be in Finland during the night.
Another reason for a lack of interest - if someone considers that it is now thin - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken one of the surprise medals from the opening, the interest would have rang up with it.
In addition, sport is only about to begin, as are other species of interest to Finnish people: sailing and horse riding.
According to Pokkiinen, the numbers from the beginning have been close to what was expected.
When the sport begins, the ratings explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the competitions, which rose in the first days of the competitions at Apple App Store for the most download free of charge in Finland.
By Monday, the app was loaded 150,000 times.
I'd say we're already on the road to 200,000 downloads.
"The numbers of the network are only available later," says Pokkinen.
Rio Areena has not acted as desired by all users.
Pokkinen says that feedback has come and that the errors have been corrected.
There has been a delay in using Rio Areena and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
An updated version has been produced of the applications, which should correct errors.
The Rio Olympic Games will be shown in the Ylen Canal and the arena more widely than any other sports event ever before.
You can follow some species from the Yle Fem channel, and on the radio Yle Pue broadcasts the races daily.
Not only are the Olympics perhaps the most laboring for the High Never, but also the last ones that can only be traced from the High Channel.
From 2018, Olympic sports will be shown on Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is your Sun, whose depth is 95,3 metres on the Crossback.
It may be even deeper.
The technical training teacher Matti Kannela found a 20 - square - foot [20 sq m] mass on the Crossback, the bottom of which was shown by a dive computer of 104 metres.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environmental Centre tried in vain to confirm the observation by echoing.
The method may not find a small deepening in 100 meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95,3 metres.
Other deep lakes are Inarijärvi (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 metres).
Over 80 metres from Saimaa, Reisvesi and Main Lake.
They have not been studied as closely as Sunshine.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
"There might well be some unknown depths," Kannela wonders.
If the deepest lake is determined by the central depth, it is the Great Lake Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
In this way, your Sun will not enter the ten deepest, and Suvasvesi will be further away from the top.
Correction on 12 August at 14.29: Repair of the last piece, where the deepest lakes were wrong at the heart of its heart.
Deprived tax sector: Increased taxation of pensioners
The taxation of pensioners remains tighter than for employees.
Ihalainen says that the malpractice appeared under the parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to those of employees.
This is not included in the Government's proposal.
We believe it should definitely be there.
The promises made should continue after the elections, he says to the West Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received income reductions, which reduced taxation.
The matter was heated in the parliament by the opposition representatives who were polishing the then Minister of Finance Alexander Stubb from the electoral promises.
Buying power will be secured, it will not grow
According to the Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo's (cf.), tax reductions are mainly about protecting and increasing purchasing power, as next year's wages will not be increased.
He says that the tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with the messages from Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Orpo about the desire to respect the competitive agreement that has been reached with difficulty.
He says that maintaining the treaty is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government.
It has been done by social organisations, so it must not be called into question.
It will be needed because the economy is so much dependent on domestic demand and people's own future faith.
Transmissible to prolonged unemployment
An admirer appeals to the government to tackle long-term unemployment in the budget gap, at least to halt its growth.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed was about 17,000 higher than one year earlier.
He says that if the growth does not stop, the government's goal of raising the employment rate to 72% will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of long-term unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social fall in the promise.
Ambassador: There are no Finnish victims in Thai attacks
Last night and last night, at least four people were killed during the bombings in Finland.
The Embassy calls on Finnish residents to be alert and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finnish tourists to withdraw their journey to Thailand because of the explosions, but we should be careful to follow the instructions of the embassy, says Westphalen.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although it is difficult to estimate their exact number.
The travel period of Finnish residents to Thailand dates from the beginning of the year.
The vast majority of Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook since the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach out to the Finns in Hua Hin in particular in order to find out about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
Generally speaking, everything seems to be fine, says Westphalen.
Could not close temporary folder: %s
According to Westphalen, there's no record of the target yet.
The Ambassador believes that the events may be linked to the political unrest of Thailand's divided society and last week's referendum on the constitution of the military train.
The Act was adopted by referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who declared themselves against the law.
In the southernmost regions of Thailand, ethnic-national conflict related to the Muslim population, says Westphalen.
Muslims want to increase their right to self-determination.
However, earlier attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big local holiday in Bangkok today, says Westphalen.
According to him, the city celebrates Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very limited.
The impact of the attacks on the day's course will be such that the authorities will be very careful about safety.
Thai Police: Attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, attacks are "local sabotage" and are different from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism is also excluded, says Thai police according to AP.
At least four people have died in Thailand during the day when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as those popular with tourists in Phuket and Hua Hin.
Also popular with Finnish tourists, the holiday island Phuket exploded four bombs in the night, says Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current data, they did not require death victims.
Two of the bombs went off in Patong Beach, according to the newspaper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded according to the newspaper.
According to the local authorities, in the popular tourist destination Hua Hin, a total of four bombs have exploded yesterday and today.
In both double-bomb attacks, at least one died.
In addition, in southern Thailand, Surat Than village, and in the city of Trang, at least one bomb exploded.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many travelers, as it leads to Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao Holiday Island.
Unknown impactor
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the Thailand-based military train, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not make people panic any more, he said to the reporters.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister for Security, Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least Hua Hin and Trang are connected.
He told the BSB that the intention of the authors was to destroy tourism in the country, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy calls on Finnish residents to be alert and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finns going to Thailand to cancel their journey because of the explosions, but the embassy's instructions should be followed with caution, says Westphalen.
Europeans affected
For the time being, very little is known about the attacks and their victims during the Finnish night.
Last night's attack in Hua Hin has given us a little bit more time.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
At least among the wounded are Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were injured in the second attack by Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded near the bell tower known as the attraction.
Thai PBS reports that the police have isolated the area in Hua Hin, where he believes he's found another bomb.
According to the governor of the county, Surat Than's bomb was hidden in the flower closet.
The municipal employee died in the attack.
There's at least one wounded.
The chief of police interviewed by CNN reports that two bombs were also used in Surat Than's attack, which exploded about half an hour apart.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs went off in front of two different police stations.
The United States Party won the Four of Women
The U.S. Alexandra Raisman was second to points 60.098 and the Russian Alija Mustafinna third to 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, is still in the Rio Championships for telecommunications with perman, jump and boom.
Biles has ruled women's gymnastics to a degree in the past few years.
He's got eight personal world titles from three previous years.
He has won the four-game and permanto championships three times in a row, as well as the boom last and second year.
The U.S. team has reached two World Championships in the Biles team.
The Biles have darker MM medals and jumps and booms.
Thai Finnish entrepreneur: "The person has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs the real estate agency in Thailand Phuket and the children's play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I do not believe that this will result in anything more wonderful, the Huovila who has been working as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many of the tragedy that has been experienced near Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then avian influenza and last year a bombing in Bangkok.
Even if they've never banished tourists before, I don't think this is.
Huovila’s office is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
Huovila heard about the attack from his own employee.
The employee called at about nine o'clock in local time and said he shouldn't come to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach street and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been set up because of the queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's celebration in Thailand.
Patong had a calm atmosphere, and the main street movements were allowed to open at about 10 a.m. local time.
On the beach, a lot of people hadn't even heard of the attacks.
During the third day of Thailand, traffic in Patong had become normalized and a large part of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the impact site, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila, who was at the strike site.
Later, the car was seen in the Kruunupy on the Jouxholm Road.
When the police arrived, the car was set on fire.
The patrol discovered two men with a conscience mark hiding in a nearby six.
The other man was captured immediately.
One of them ran away, but later they found him in the woods using a cop dog.
Men are suspected of using a motor vehicle, theft and gross injury.
The police are grateful to those who gave the clues.
Director of Research on Russian leadership changes: Clear deportation
In Russia, the highest-ranking leadership change was made on Friday, when President Vladimir Putin dismissed the Head of his regime, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is a civilized 44-year-old Anton Vago.
He's an ex- diplomat. He was Ivanov's number two man.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov’s separation can be Putin’s desire to prevent strong people from gathering too much power around him.
He adds that the recycling of management tasks is a way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from building up a power independent of the President.
According to the Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been crammed or screwed up with other leaders.
Station drop to Ivanov
Ivanov, who is part of Putin's inner circle, is taking up specific tasks in environmental and transport matters.
With the state media, Putin said change into a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to be transferred to other positions and suggested that he replace Vaino, reported Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that, from Ivanov's point of view, this is a clear downfall.
The environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of the Russian rule.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the Security Council of the President.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union at the KGB.
He was considered possible as a successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old map, such as the governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Katri Pynnöniemi, Senior Researcher from the Institute for Foreign Policy, says that it is more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place that Putin will change his neighbourhood to younger people.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield as they retreated in Syria.
They used civilians as a human shield when they fled to the city of Jarabulus to avoid targeting them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters received about 90 percent of the important city of Manbij.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists were left in the city at that time.
Revised earlier news at 7:30: In the past, we misbehaved to tell the civilians that they were fleeing the city, in fact, the Isis fighters kidnapped civilians when they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's public policy is against the law
The guidelines of the Ministry of Interior on the publication of documents are illegal, says Professor of Public Law Tomi Voutilainen of the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutilainen says to the STT that the publication of documents cannot be based on the Authority's own guidelines but is based on the law.
The Ministry of Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants in the Minister of Interior's events to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision under the guidance of the Office of the Government and the fact that the information had been entered in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Ministry's Communication Director tells the STT that the need to reform practices has been noted in the Ministry.
Usain Bolt's final Olympic show starts in Rio
Like in the last few years, Bolt has been running for time under the precious races.
From the beginning, he broke his way back and had to skip Jamaica’s Olympics.
This has not been a complete preparation, but I am in much better shape.
I've been practicing well, and that's the key thing, and Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included small-scale samba dancers and fans.
Around Porina Bolt, the Yamian star has risen over a period of time in which sport has been struggling with doping scandals and skating interest.
Bolt’s previous defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he was cut off in the 200 - foot [200 m] primer at 21.05.
At that time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by injuries and loose training.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred feet [100 m] by which he crushed the world record and his competitors’ confidence in the final event, despite being born at the time of 9.69 C.E.
It's harder than this.
A year later, at the Berlin World Cup, Bolt reached his career at the point of law.
World records, born in Berlin, are still valid at 9.58 a.m. and 19.19 a.m.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is pursuing a 200-metre world record and a 19-second understatement, but no one believes that it is just Bolt himself.
Satasella Bolt's great challenger is the Olympic winner of Athens 2004 Justin Gatlin.
Last year at the Beijing World Cup Bolt defeated an American in just one hundredths of seconds.
During its reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost even once in the finals of the prizes if only he has made his way.
In Dägur, the World Cup of 100th in 2011 was missed by Bolt because of a false departure.
Bolt will be over 30 in a week.
He's an old man in a young man's race, and Rio's competitions are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London as the final goal of his career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the others.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But whenever I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Shows about Rio: Two athletes are suspected of a doping offense
According to Xinhua, the Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has provided a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi found traces of prohibited substances on the doping sample.
Bulgarian drinker Silvia Danekova is also suspected of a doping offense.
In addition, the Kenyan sports coach was sent to my home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of an epo hormone.
He was in Rio for the fourth time in a 100-metre female butterfly.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estaio, the Chinese fin has taken its doping case to the International Court of Appeal of Sports CAS.
Xinhua says that the sample Xinyi gave on Sunday would have found signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
There have also been other doping suspicions in Rio.
The BBC reports that Bulgarian female drinker Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of epo hormone.
Kenya has, in turn, been sent home by a sports coach from Rio because of a doping offense.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee KOK reported that the Kenyan coach had become a sportsman in the test situation and had given a doping sample for this.
According to the media, this is Kenyan fast-track coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had been using Ferguson Rotich's race pass for 800 metres.
There's no stopping Phelps... no history of gold came out of the show.
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swims 200 meters apart 22nd Olympics in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympics.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to reach the Olympic gold of the same species in the fourth consecutive races.
Phelps' payout was 1.54.66.
The Japanese Kosuke Hagino placed in a blending second before the Chinese Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, and Helen Skelton, the BBC Olympic Commander, is laughing at an interview in the Evening Journal.
The case of Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read events of this week's Evening Magazine website.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton will not be very stressed if there is a small amount of noise in the media or in the media about his revealing and special outfits.
Well, television's a visual media, he insists.
Skelton is dressed in high-interest shoes and in a short dress that will certainly have at least sufficient exposure - at least to the eyes of a number of conservative British soys.
However, there are no back steps.
It's important to look good, and small judges are just a funny thing.
I'm sure Skelton wants to be alarmed and perhaps startled, but he insists that he doesn't want to be in the main role.
This isn't about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus needs to be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the court has reached Finland?
I can't, but everything that's paying attention to how hard these swimmers are doing work and how big sacrifices they make is okay with me, Skelton is whining.
You know what?
It's a scream about nothing if it comes from the dress of a drunkard.
I'm a little bit amused if it's hit someone's radar.
Rio P.D. Two arrests due to a terrorist suspicion.
On Thursday, the Rio Police reported two arrests due to a terrorist suspicion.
The police made arrests in connection with the safety oversight of the competitions.
In the same context, the police made five other arrests and questioned two persons before their release.
All suspects have been Brazilians.
According to the G1 news page, persons arrested for terrorism belong to the same group already arrested by the police in July.
The arresters are believed to have links to the Isis extremist organization.
The arresters had been reportedly provocative of violence in social media.
Messages calling for violence were distributed, among other things, in the WhatsApp service.
The safety of the Rio Championships is 85,000 policemen.
The police blew up a suspicious package in Rio.
Spain and Nigeria had to start their game at the beginning of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
The police found a suspicious package of basketball arenas and closed the place to the public.
The police let the public in after the controlled explosion of the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics when the police carried out a controlled mission of explosion.
The police shut down the arena because of the suspicious package they found there.
The public got in when the police had been controlled to blow up the package.
The audience did not record the scene by the start of the fight, because the police closed it down because of the suspicious package found at the arena.
The police blew up the package and let the public into the hall only after that.
The drink awoke the competitions to the Spanish team that started the dream.
With two defeats, the Spanish starter won Nigerian points 96-87.
In the last two races, Spain reached silver.
The police already carried out a controlled explosive mission during the Rio Summer Games for the third time.
Last time, police were forced to blow up a suspicious discovery near the roadside destination last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria began their game in front of empty viewers at the beginning of the Rio basketball tournament.
The Argentinan lady stabbed Cheater-Siren - the Finnish was considering the protest.
The wind of Cheater-Siren had a colorful day in Rio.
The wind of Cheater-Siren was hard on Thursday.
The Argentinan lady stabbed the Wind of Traitor-Siren in Rio on Thursday at the opening of the women's surfing day.
There was a clear breach of the wind.
The opponent admitted the crime.
He got stuck because of the accident, and the others ran away, Joakim Wilenius, the Finnish chief coach, told me.
The athlete thought about the protest for a long time.
Then it was not worth doing so, as it would have been futile according to the Olympic rules.
I should have dropped in the water so I could get some credit, Traitor-Siren said.
The Finnish hanging on their board to the last, because they didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
Finland remained in place 27 with the crash.
The 2012 Olympic Silver Medal in London is the eighth in the overall situation.
In terms of pain, the accident didn't affect much.
It's a big day on Friday when you're racing 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Traitor-Siren did not protest.
7 specialities, which according to science extend age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These matters have been proven to bring more years into the person’s life.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect the person’s health so that his life lengths.
On the other hand, sometimes things that a person cannot influence can bring him more years.
These include a tendency to moderate obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can lead to an increase in age.
You don't always have to do that, you know, just pick up a can of milk.
The secret of longevity has been sought to investigate many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest research results.
According to science, all these things may lead to more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee has been found to protect against cancer, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
Harvard University research found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a "lower risk of death", particularly as regards neurological or cardiac diseases.
Now, on behalf of alcohol, there are studies that show that the use of justice - from one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived as parents as people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of toothpaste can prolong a person’s life by up to six years, says one study.
The argument is based on the fact that this prevents gum infections.
On the other hand, they can contribute to the onset of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway found out how laughing had an impact on human life.
More than 54 000 people were monitored by a project lasting seven years.
Those who laughed more were more than 35 percent more likely to survive when the experiment ended.
Sex, when the protection against sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, is, according to many studies, good for health.
In addition to everything, it can also prolong the life span.
Unfortunately, just having sex as it is is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years of his life, he should also have an orgasm.
Mobility, of course, will bring more years, and it will not be denied.
However, reaching a long-term age does not require absolute alkalinity.
A study at Oxford University found that women with a big ass had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study combined these factors with lower mortality.
Whether it was an athlete or an actor who won the Olympic medals, he would be more likely to live longer than a normal bull.
A lot of research has been trying to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring his life more years.
Some scientists suspect, however, that a long life is due to a person's social status - which, for its part, makes it possible, for example, to seek recognition such as the Nobel Prize.
A study on shopping behaviour in people over 65 years found that the person shopping daily, i.e. likely to make shopping less frequent.
This is due to the fact that spinning in specific trades reduces loneliness.
Once again, it has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that might speed up death.
So count the credit card from your hand, so online shopping doesn't have the same effect.
Drunkard's drink went off in the truck.
There was a serious car accident on Friday night in Koske, Southwest Finland.
The accident took place in Koskke, mid-Friends and Sorvastonie at 9 p.m. on Friday.
The truck had been driving towards Forssa when the received passenger car had hit the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the crash, the truck was up to its stripes, but it burned.
The driver managed to turn off the fire himself.
The passenger car went down into the ditch and then over the well to the roof.
A woman born in 1972 who carried a passenger car remained under pressure in her car.
The rescue unit removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to Turku University Hospital for treatment.
The result of the female blow test was 2.02 miles.
He's suspected of being drunk in a car.
The mail sent loose candy to the wrong city.
There were deficiencies in the range of K-Citymarkets in Salon because the mail had accidentally delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki.
On Thursday, Teija Halltia was buying loose candy from Salon K-City Market when a fun sign hit my eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in bulk because Posti delivered our load to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when the Post delivers the load!
So if you don't get the traffic on the lawn cut, the sign says it.
The tuxedo sign of the merchant relates to the fact that the Post expanded its services last spring to include lawnmowers.
Weed cutting is offered by Post until the end of August.
Haltia felt that the sign was mainly amusing and decided to share it in social media.
The popularity of the update hit me with a big surprise.
The media, too, have been calling all along, and the attention that has been drawn to this is incredible, Mr. Hallia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia's update had more than 700 distributions on Facebook.
Hallia got her own favorites caught in a loose box, even though some of them were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the business of the transport services of the Post companies, was sorry for the damage to Ilta-Sanomom.
The background is that three of the five stage were lost yesterday in the wrong place (Senajoki), and we no longer went to the sub-delivery (Salo) by three, but only today we took five stages, and Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
It's the first news item in the evening news.
Teija Hallt did not get mad at the sign because she found all her own freeware favorites in the selection.

At that time, he told the Evening magazine that he wanted to finally get to the normal weight, which was then ten pounds [10 kg].
During the three - month fitness period, five pounds finally fell.
The hope of a murdered woman's family in Loviisa: the memory of the victim for the benefit of the police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim would be remembered instead of flowers and addresses by donation for the benefit of police work.
Sipoon Veterinary Station has published an Facebook update in which it conveys the wish of the victim's family for donations for police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipoo Veterinary Office and had also carried out his nursing training there.
The veterinary station remembers her with words that touch her.
Happy, smart, sense of humor and work fearless.
A good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update states that all donation money goes to police dogs, first and foremost to purchase safety vests.
Last Friday, 42-year-old Loviisa was murdered in her own courtyard in Koskenkyla, Loviisa.
The women's neighbors have told the evening paper that the victim was very much in love with animals.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and flowers.
A 27-year-old man who was suspected of murder didn't know a woman and had no connection with each other.
The killer's tracking involved a police dog Börje, who was life-threateningly wounded in the arrest.
But the Börje survived and is recovering.
The Circumstances condemned Post for breach of the Equality Act
The post was not entitled to suspend the salary of the employee who refused to study the temporary worker, and the district court of Kanta-Häme in its judgment did not.
The district court ordered Post to pay the worker most of the paid salary arrested and EUR 2 000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, the Posti could have arrested only part of the employee’s salary, which was responsible for the part of the study work throughout the day.
According to the Circumstances, the employee was placed in a more favourable position on the basis of his trade union activity, contrary to the Equality Act.
The staff member had complied with the PAU's decision on the ban on access to information by the Union for Postal and Logistics.
During last November's postal strike, PAU made a decision that Posti's employees would not be familiar with renters who broke the strike.
First, the People's News told us about it.
Returning Turkey to a way that respects human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, written by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (ps.) in his reply to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In its earlier letter, the Journalist Union asked Sipil and Soil to express their concern for the freedom of expression and the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini report that Finland has repeatedly brought to Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and freedom of expression.
Putin dismissed the commander of his regime to replace the Estonian-based Vauso
Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired Sergei Ivanov, Head of the Presidential Administration, says.
The Soviet-Viro Communist leader, Karl Jaco's grandson, Anton Vago.
He is a 44-year-old diplomat who has served as Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, the news office of Interfax tells us.
Vladimir Putin fired the chief of his administration.
According to the Kremlin press release, Ivanov, who is part of Putin's tight inner circle, will be transferred to specific tasks in environmental and transport matters.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to be transferred to other positions and suggested that he replace Vaino, says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet occupation of the KGB.
Many considered Ivanov as a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Mr Ivanov was appointed President in 2011 before Putin was re-elected President in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant acquisition of the game ban is not seen in the opening of Valioliga
The world record of football transfers will not be seen on the field when Valioliiga is kicked in the weekend.
Paul Pogba's game ban followed along with England.
The Manchester United giant acquisition of Paul Pogba will be sidelined by the ManU on Sunday against Bournemouth due to a gambling ban, BBC reported on Friday.
According to the British media, the Italian Society of Pogba paid EUR 105 million to Juventus.
However, the F.A.F. is keeping him out of the game because Pogbale was burdened with the game ban on Juventus.
He received two warnings in the last season's Italian Cup, and it'll be a one-game game ban.
That game ban has been moved to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is on the second round of the league on August 19th, when ManU meets Southampton.
Flow of grandeur is a virtue
The exact criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have established the Flow Festival position as an internationally appreciated event by the world’s top artists.
The Flow Festival begins on Friday in Helsinki.
Festarians typically express themselves by their own dress.
One of the top stage artists is punk legend Iggy Pop this year.
The Flow Festival event area is ranked with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to have just the main stage and the beer, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival in the Summer of Helsinki this weekend has grown from a small block festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The simple question behind success is: What kind of event would the authors themselves want to go to?
It's kind of strange in the incestrums, that's what we're thinking.
Often, the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with official regulations, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would be here this year to sell it out.
The aim was to increase the number of visitors in the last year's 70,000 people by 5,000.
Even this year, a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists will be seen at the festival.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because there is something to be funded in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle, which is controlled by huge routes.
That's not what we want.
The ideology of the successful event has been expanded over 13 years with 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurants and drinking bars in the partially artificial grassed area.
In addition to the main platform and smaller performance platforms, 15,000 people's tents work this year.
Kallio admits that the event could be implemented more simply.
Maybe I'm a little bit of a magistrate, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If you lose it, it's not our thing anymore.
The greatest pleasure and reward for the work done for Kallio is that today, even great visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event in the middle of the 21st century, activities depended very much on the support of the City of Helsinki of Helsinki for some 20 000 euros.
Last year, the turnover of the company running Flow was around EUR 6 million.
It can create "creepy things", like building that 73-metre wide tent.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves with their own self-righteous clothing.
In addition to the music event, you can talk about the trendy adult community of young adults.
However, the event is not deliberately profiled as a particularly fashionable one.
We want to break up, above all, with the contents.
Nevertheless, fashion phenomena also fit into Flow's values: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the top stage artists is the legend of the tick, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
A man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer of the festival that combines indierock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was struck because it is likely to be the last time that this will be seen at the concert in Finland.
We're all interested in history and the future.
Not just what they call on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest record is damn good, and he's been doing some damn good work over the last few years.
The bombs of Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in the purses, the tourists fled horrendously.
In Hua Hin, two bombs exploded during the local time on Thursday night.
At least one local woman died in the attack and over 20 were injured.
Apparently, the bombs were hidden in a purse and blown up using cell phones.
The bombs were placed on a street most of whose clients are foreigners.
They were blown up at the same time as tourists started leaving the bars and returning to their hotels, the police representative said, according to the CNN of Samoa Yoosumran.
Since 1989, a wild animal protector named Edwin Wiek, who lived in Asia, gave a much-speaking picture of the attacks.
If the TV isn't showing up properly, you can watch it here.
Of those injured in Hua Hin, at least 11 were foreign tourists.
The people were running against me and said that the bomb had exploded at the bar.
It happened on one of the biggest bar streets, told Swedish tourist Emlie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded at Surat Than, local time.
At least one died.
The number of injuries is not yet known.
Very soon after this, even the Finns preferred two bombs on Phuket Island.
No one's dead, apparently.
At the same time, there was another double-bomb attack in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in Trang City.
The police reported that they found at least one bomb in Hua Hini that had not yet had time to explode.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely rebel troops behind the bombings that are not satisfied with the activities of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, it may also be criminal organisations.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently become very busy with the activities of criminal organisations involved in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new standby team will go to battle first in a war situation
In an acute war situation, military officers are only ordered after several months of taking a military oath, says the Central Finn.
According to the Chief of Defence Training of the Defence Forces interviewed by the newspaper, Brig-Gen Jukka Sonninen, for example, of 5,5 months of service in war situations, only those who are in the final stages of their training are combatable.
According to the Head of Education, the service will first be assigned to the reserve staff.
No backup or reserve is ordered to carry out a task that has not been provided with the required training, says Sonnen.
Earlier in the summer, it appeared that the Defence Forces will start training the guards for immediate preparedness units from next year.
If necessary, the units may be used for military operations already during the training of the guard.
Pamela Tola received a huge payment from the home house.
Actor Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough fight in the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of a two-storey separate house had been EUR 330 000.
However, after trade, there was a serious moisture problem in the house that caused a dangerous microbial growth in health.
The couple had to sell the dwelling as a disintegration in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132 000, so the financial loss for Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198,000.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a discount from the seller.
The salesman denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case both in district court and court court.
Court of Justice delivered judgment on the case on Wednesday.
It maintained the judgment of the district court, which ordered the seller to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150 000 for a price reduction.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 344 for the trial and settlement expenses of the couple.
The right justifies the price reduction slightly, as some housing repair needs had already been known to the purchasers in the course of the sale of the dwelling.
However, according to the court’s law, the errors in the building were significantly more serious than had been presented.
Tola was looking for a good home.
Tola told me in court that the couple had been looking for a good home because they did not want to go to repair work.
He had come to the conclusion that the building was renovated and in good condition and that the points mentioned in the health check report were not harmed.
The fitness check report mentioned as risks and disadvantages of ventilation and the lack of adequate management of rain and melting water through rock studies.
However, the discussions did not reveal that this was an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma thought that rainwaters from the rock might need to be controlled a little over a few years.
The trades were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it turned out that housing moisture problems were much more serious than they thought.
The inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 showed microbial growth in the building, which, according to the Witnesses, was due to both the rainwaters of the rock and the land moisture that had risen in capillary.
On the west side of the house, the air contaminated by the microbes was estimated by the inspector to be able to reach the indoors through the porch.
The homeroom, the basement stairs, the living room window breaker, and the basement washroom were found in test samples to allow a health risk.
The terraces were built without permission
The Court also contested whether the building permit had been extended.
The Court considered that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the City of Espoo’s decision to make any illegal changes to the building before the transaction.
Among other things, the terraces had been built even though there were no appropriate permits.
However, home problems were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Justice, according to the information received from the seller before trade, buyers could assume that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need for measurable repairs in the near future.
In the view of Tola and Waroma, there was no particular reason for the Court to carry out a more extensive inspection than usual.
The purchasers have not failed to comply with their obligation to report, the Court of Justice states in its judgment.
Scary archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to have children in the Nazi register, including Finns
The editor, Christopher Andersson, writes in his recent article on Dagens Nyheter, how the National Archives in Maryland in the United States have recorded documents on microfilms concerning a total of 218 500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are Germans, but they also include Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian, 14 Finnish, and 31 Swedish women wanted Nazi morality.
The documents and registration cards come from a racial agency in Nazi Germany.
The agency worked under the command of SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS-man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS-doctor.
The same applies, to an even greater extent, to women who had to be able to bear up to 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynecological studies were carried out in women to find out.
The racial agency studied women’s backgrounds, for example, by studying church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the female family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up Swedish citizenship and to give birth control reports and good recommendations from close relatives.
The agency wanted guarantees that women were "loved children", "saves", and "good national socialists" who knew very well German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as bridesm of SS men.
It doesn't tell you what happened to the 14 Finnish women who found in the archives.
SS leaders set up a state-supported programme known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The programme provided, among other things, for each SS man to have four children, whether married or outside.
The Lebensborn Homes take care of children born outside marriage and their mothers.
However, the programme was not very actively promoted; it is reported on the pages of the U.S. Holocaust Museum.
Instead, Nazi demographic policy focused on family and marriage.
The State encouraged marriage by providing loans and support to children.
A German mother’s honorary Christian was granted to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, the marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, and found on the museum's pages.
The sixth of the traitor-Siren, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko ranked third on the first departure of the Finnjolli Day at the Rio Olympic Games, but remained the top of the whole group on the second departure of the day.
In total, he rose to the eighth after five departures, but the failure of the second departure put him in position on 14th.
The wind Traitor-Siren fought RS:X in the departures of day 17 and three.
In the overall situation, Traitor Siren is the sixth.
In the 470s, Jonah and Niklas Lindgren remained in place at the opening of the day 23.
In the overall situation, the Lindgreni are in position 19.
Jari Sillanpää's Satulinna was recorded in a couple of hours of nights, "I was so hungover"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of Finnish favorite artists for over 20 years.
From the barbeque of the cruiser to the 1995 Tango King, the best selling solo artist in Finland, and the star of the dances and festivals, Sillanpää is still washing and he is currently in a wild lift.
A book written by Mari Koppinen about the life of a favorite singer, Jari Sillanpää, was published today on Thursday.
In the book, Sillanpää tells of his life and career as well as in evil.
The bridge’s career rose to a total rise in winning the Tang King’s crown on the market of the River Seina in 1995.
In the race, Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had written a tango piece on the bridge at the request of a man who was adapted by Kassu Halonen to a slightly different form.
The piece of Satulinna rose to one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says, however, that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Bridgehead sang it on the tape in a terrible hangover and only after a few hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so hungover!
The bridgehead remembers in the book.
You wouldn't think it was a song in a hangar.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, the mark was still good.
I learned that all the time you don't have to ask yourself to be perfect and peak.
Another incident related to one of the most popular songs in the book happened nearly twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his then partner, and the case eventually ended up in the texts of the You earned gold piece, which was published as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered by Sarah Törmäs were not what the Sillanpää would have wanted.
The bridge head had imagined to be making a record that tells a true story about his own life, but the words of the separate song were not true, but it was written on the basis of the news of the 7 days magazine.
In the news of the magazine, Jari and the ex-loved difference were caused by the excessive celebration of Jari and the drinking of alcohol, but Jari said it was a full dome and it was not true.
According to the book, Jari played in a rage to the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and good.
In June, the British also surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
Finally, 52% of voters were in favour and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though the opinion polls of the voting week anticipate the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university signed for the divorce, although a few individual researchers were allowed to disagree with the current of their profession.
The theme statement 'It's the economy, stupid', of the former US President Bill Clinton's previous election campaign, flew to ruin in the British Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when their voices didn't belong.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic gypsum
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics collects answers from professionals to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened to because this time voters took a decision on non-economic grounds.
One of the comments of the economists on the loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many people still have the impression that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in work, which is almost constant.
If the immigrant gets a job, it'll be off the right British side.
Many people also have the impression that a fall in the value of currency would be a good thing because it contributes to the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economist, voters did not believe the economic arguments, because the consensus of the economists was not sufficiently expressed.
In particular, they were struck by the balance of the BBC, which gave just as much space to economic scientists who favour only a couple of per cent of the EU's economy as to the overwhelming majority.
The EU's hate press was not interested in telling us what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and other economic power letters and the consequences of the difference are.
These distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly about economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were both heard and understood, they were not conveyed because the economists represent an elite with which voters do not believe that there are common interests.
Although academics such as economicists would have stayed in the EU, the message did not work in small towns and rural areas.
Immigration is also an economy
The overwhelming victory argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
Immigrant takes your job, Immigrants traffickers your hospital, Immigrants take advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Each cafe has foreign employees.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health centre in the waiting room sees immigrants.
How much easier would the British get medical time if they weren't?
Every school has children of immigrants, too.
How much easier would it be for the children of the real Brits to get a place to go to school if they got rid of them?
In every municipality, there are foreigners.
How much more space would the natives have if they were to leave?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond, and if they did, their responses did not get any visibility.
Economists failed to explain that immigrants have increased numbers of jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security thanks to immigrants.
Immigrants - and particularly EU migrants - are net contributors of the British public finances and their consumption generate jobs.
Aberdeen real estate fund booked for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investment is carried out by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
According to her, in Aberdeen, they planned for Brexit in time by drawing up plans A and B.
The plan for B, i.e. the victory of the EU-difference camp, started to be more detailed a few weeks before the vote in case the result was lost.
The concern was that investors would start to withdraw their funds from the market.
As a rule, real estate funds do not have a large amount of liquid resources, but they could now be necessary.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit was on the 23rd day, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, says Vanhanen of Aberdeen's only open daily notation biked from the real estate fund, which was covered by the news.
According to the old man, the normal level would be between 15 and 20 per cent.
The value of the fund at that time was £3.5 billion.
The total value of the company’s funds is around GBP 20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, says Vanhanen of all open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was 10 % or even less.
So the real estate funds reserved for Brexit with very different strategies.
Fund closures
When an EU-difference camp won, Europe went crazy.
However, the less than two weeks that followed the vote on the real estate market were quite calm, says Vanhanen.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was the speech by Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, who estimates that Brexit can be a big risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first real estate fund, Standard Life, frozen its trade.
Together, these have made the situation worse and have brought the financial Times and the BBC to the top of the case.
The situation was immediately compared between 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calm, but private investors were nervous.
Snowball started spinning, and the fund had to close its doors after each other.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash collected, but eventually it had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the old man, they did not actually close down trade but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether it is worth taking the money out in panic.
The message from Aberdeen was that if you're not forced to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would cost you a lot of money.
It calmed down the situation, and most of it canceled the report.
Since then, it has been quite smooth, and now the market has been very calm for a few weeks, says Vanhanen.
He points out that, for example, the Manner-European Funds in Aberdeen did not have any similar upheaval.
But there were a lot of interviews.
Unfair attention to real estate funds
According to the old man, the closures of real estate funds trades received disproportionate attention.
The open funds concerned by the closures account for around 4% of British real estate.
Aberdeen’s lock lasted six days and the company sold out less than ten properties from 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned their investors this week that it might hold its fund for half of 2017.
There is currently uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been broken down, but the situation does not seem to be far worse for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British national economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has even brought some of the real estate investors new opportunities, says Vanhanen.
The rate of the pound and the dollar is lowest for 30 years, with a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
The dollar maker can now buy the same property up to 30 percent cheaper.
There's a lot of willing buyers, old man says.
Brexit imported mines on the London real estate market
At two o'clock in the morning, the situation didn't seem so much different.
But at four o'clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, responsible for the real estate investment of the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up to look back at the results of the Brexit vote, there was another situation.
That's the strength of your head, isn't it?
I realized that this is now going to plan B, says Vanhanen in his second home in Helsinki.
He went straight to work.
London City was already alive despite the night.
The TV screens normally set out at the office to be silent supported the news, and usually the loud people were completely silenced to listen when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell us about his divorce.
When the market opened, the end of the screen flashed red.
It was one of those mornings you never thought you'd be alive, says Old Man.
It is not, therefore, that, despite the mess in Aberdee, one of the biggest real estate funds in Britain, finished two real estate transactions on the day after the Brexit vote.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company was well prepared for the alternative, and that's why the situation was kind of calm, says Vanhanen.
Brexit vote started the repair movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
Puna collapsed. Britain's lead went on the exchange.
The market was beginning to anticipate sharp declines in the British real estate market, in particular in London.
As much as 20% of the expenditure in London’s offices was projected in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the noise has subdued, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
True, it does not show up on the old man’s face this week who spent his last summer vacation in Helsinki.
He thinks it is far too early to say much about what Brexit is doing.
So much is still open: how the difference happens and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
First of all, the development of the London real estate market has already taken place.
CBRE’s data on price developments cover about one third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all London's properties fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City's office buildings, the minus accumulated 6.1 per cent, says Vanhanen.
The figures aren't that bad, but they're monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have had fewer figures, says Vanhanen.
All the same cuts hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting, therefore, that Brexit was compared very quickly with Lehman's fall and with the global economic crisis that began in the US real estate market.
The old man thinks that the parable is not quite right, because now it is a domestic crisis in Britain.
The atmosphere is different, too.
The real estate market has now seen, not panic sales like that time, but the willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
There's also a standard financial guarantee.
In any event, the correction movement could have been in front of
In fact, it's not a miracle to him that the price adjustment movement could have been in front of him without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen, property prices in London and other worlds have been too high for years.
We have said for two years that City, especially the offices, is overpriced, says Vanhanen.
So the fall started really high.
London's prices have written upwards for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown strongly, so has London's population.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last class of property that is globalising, says Vanhanen.
New players have become markets in the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate sites abroad.
London, known as the city, is an easy destination.
In addition, prices have been fed by low interest rates, which, for example, means that pension companies have been forced to look for profits from new targets.
This loan has been readily available - although the debt margin has been used by Vanhase now clearly less than during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
Disperse, disperse
In London, the price rise has stabilised last summer, says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen, too, began to ease his ownership in London, and last year he was a net seller.
There was some kind of turning to be expected, and now it's here.
What's going on?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says Vanhanen.
He's not afraid to judge what's coming, but he says that there's hardly any way to get up.
The atmosphere indicates that there is a downward or even way forward.
The old man has already seen several movements up and down, as he has been in the real estate since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who thinks they can survive the pits at work.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you will be in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in one market, it's too much for the victim.
If you've dissipated, the risks are also decentralised, says Vanhanen.
S-Group is starting to register purchase data more closely
Soon the S-Group will know what you are eating, as today the trading group reported that it is beginning to collect more detailed information on its customers' purchases.
After the final amount of the receipt has been collected so far, the group will start picking it up at the beginning of May for the products purchased.
The S-Group follows Kesko here, because data on goods purchased with a plus card have been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to K-Plus Oy's CEO, Ismo Riitala, the feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
The product-specific data shall be collected with the consent of the customer and used with the consent of the customer for marketing purposes.
The most effective channel is email.
A rather rare customer has banned the use of product information, says Riitala to the economy.
According to him, Kesko is not going to react to Group S's registration change.
Kesko is already classifying her regular client according to merely buying food in ten groups.
The classification shall be updated monthly.
Customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money they spend on them.
The information is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data are collected only from the K-Group's own chains.
Co-operating partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a parent client program and this is not planned for this period.
The Finnish Close Shop has its own "One-Bonus" customer program, which can be associated with in Valtavatalos, Siwok and Euromarkets.
At the moment we do not collect product or product group-level information, we stick to the final amount of the receipt.
So we know which store the purchases were made, and that day, and the final amount of the customer's receipt.
We have not gone to that level as the K-Group or the S-Group, says the commercial leader Anu Ora.
According to him, the regular client programme will be reformed in the future, but the close trade will tell you about it later.
However, Ora does not promise that the product information will be registered.
First try
The customer and customer register of SOK has so far been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal and address information, basic information has included: occupation, education, housing, years of birth of children and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role have also been registered.
The purchase date and time, the place, the final amount of purchases and the method of payment have been saved from the S-Education Card Purchase.
In addition, data from S-bonus partners have been obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, purchase data at product level will be deposited in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
On the other hand, the S-markets, Prismos, Kodin Terroi and ABC chains currently record the information at product group level.
For a long time, customers have been hoping to focus more on marketing, says Marjana Saarikoski, the customer owner and partner manager of SOK.
The S-Group says they're going to inform their clients about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the information is stored in the bags, whether you want it or not.
The willing person can check the stored data from the S-Group's website.
For example, the cashiers do not have access to the information, stressing Saarikoski.
Video: Heila puppy is Tulli's latest dog reinforcement - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The black labrador donor pups the five similar countries with a rowed box at Helsinki Airport.
It won't take long for it to sit firmly next to the middle box.
The customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his dog Heila to play it with his favorite toy.
In the box next to which Heila sat, there was a jar of shells that smelled like powder gas.
Soap gas is the first smell that Heila and I have been practicing, says Suntio, the owner of Heila's dog.
Security situation and access to online commerce
Heila is the first dog specializing in the search for Tulli weapons and explosives and it will be located at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also take Heila and Sunto to other border crossing points and ports, if necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila's main job because the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused action in Customs, and the controls have been strengthened after the attacks, says Mikko Grönberg, the Oversight Officer of Customs.
The second entry to the training of a dog with weapons and explosives Customs is mailing through Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the increased internet trade, up to 40 million mail mails are delivered each year through the airport, which may include weapons and explosives ordered abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made online shops at Helsinki Airport, including baggage and air cargo for passenger machinery, approximately 300 weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives and their precursors.
Heila will work across Helsinki Airport.
It will examine checked baggage and mail.
In ports, it will be of great benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more research, says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of Heila, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is hoping for the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
The education of the Heila puppy is coordinated by the Tull dog school in Kirkkonumme.
The Suntio also attends training with Heila with police and defence experts.
The police have strong experience of dog training and defence expertise in explosives.
Customs will decide together with other authorities what smells Heila will be taught to identify.
Heila is always trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues in Helsinki Airport include six drug dogs, and the money and the drug dog Massi.
Labrador retriever Heila has been chosen from the 10 puppies' pups.
The selection criteria for the dog to be selected at the airport include a hole in the hunt, as well as calmness, as the dog is involved in weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion's home, is a close associate of the customs inspector, but also a member of the family.
Nothing without Heila gets home, Suntio laughs.
The subtle orders go to Heila from a single laak.
The cameraman of the Evening-Sanome loses the camera mike cover to the fast dog, but Heila returns the soft cover immediately from the "crap" command.
Hard competition from working dogs
Heila's initial education will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, then in October, which assesses whether training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heilan can be seen in work in Helsinki Airport next year, if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to petal the work vests on top of the dog, reminds Suntio.
The cost of one working dog is around EUR 60000-70000 per year for customs purposes.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, even ten, after which they retire to the care of their owners.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active parts last only 10 minutes to a few hours.
The owner of working dogs is a tough competition in Tull.
Heila was owned by about 20-30 Customs employees.
Luck hit Suntio, who has never had a work dog before, but has years of experience in dogs and control tasks in Customs.
The Ministate got their first Olympic medal - People get a day off
The Olympics in Fiji, with less than a million inhabitants, are valued in the country so high that the government has appointed August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the country's broadcasting company, the Fijian government confirmed the state of the championship.
The day off will be held the day after the team return.
There are also festiveities for the heroic team in his country.
Fiji's Rugby team is celebrating the championship.
The Guardian says that the country was following the finals in the capital city of Suval, where the stadium had been erected with a screen.
Normally, only the native Fijians are interested in Rugby, but this game combined our multicultural community.
Even the Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them encourage, said Fiji Times reporter to Maiikele Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish buyer passed out after a wild performance
In his last attempt, the pusher, Milo Tokola, succeeded from 175 kilos after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During or immediately after criminal liftings, he has passed out many times.
Nobody's really been able to tell me why.
In Rio, Tokola gained 175 kilos and 145 kilos of push.
His joint outcome was 320 kilos.
Tokola tried to get her unemployed at the last 175 pounds, as did the other one.
On the third attempt, the weights rose as a result of wild screaming.
The crown was shaking under the weights until the jury accepted the raise.
The pleasure of the Finnish buyer was that he had suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired the Estonian winner Prosa - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Society, which plays in the Men's Football League, has concluded a sustainable agreement with Estonian winner Albert Prosa.
We are looking for our team's top player, who has power and has a small threshold for coming to Finland and Rovaniemi.
We went through more than ten players with agents from around the world.
Little silence from the crowd began to resign as a good alternative Prosa, coach Juha Malinen of the RoPS, reported in the release.
Prosa, 25, arriving in RoPS from the Talentan Flora, where she scored a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played in the Estonian country team.
The Prosan is due to be with RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemins will meet the ruling Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new attacker when last season secular king Alexander Kokko moved to Australia.
The proud Modern Family star repositions: the teen star shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who became known as Alex Dunphyna as the modern family comedy, yet again blows up by presenting his proud body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in minishorts that don't leave much to imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also his ass.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by making his style and behaviour much more courageous.
The star has posed in his pictures published in social media in very few clothes and took numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen to dress in very poor clothes.
Winter, on the threshold of adulthood, has recently published several images of himself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can look at it here.
Earlier this summer Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his image so radically.
In this case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter had a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He's been on TV almost all his life and grew up in the Kardashians' era.
He has learned that the more it appears to reveal the surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood, Palmer tells Fox News and adds that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has been inflamed by some of his long - term fans with their imagogy.
It is not hard to guess where she will be in ten years, when the bottom line is already so hard, says one woman in Winter's Instagram.
Some of the female fans, on the other hand, defend an actor and urge him not to give a damn about criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what the others say.
You're an inspiration to a lot of women, a young woman glows.
Japanese prefers to visit Finland - tourists are attracted to a revant: The autumn is possible to see the accursed storm aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to begin their return trips from the early fall, Visit Finland explains in the newsletter.
Inari and Levi are the main targets of Japanese return tourism.
The northern lights are the driving cards of our winter travel, and they are closely connected to the winter of the heart and the snowy landscapes.
In Lapland's winter, the resonators have very much to demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
It is rare to know that the revant season begins early in the autumn and continues far into spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called Mirror Aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the display two times random, says Anne Lind, marketing manager.
Visit Finland's main target group is wealthy 25-35-year-olds, Japanese women living in the city who dream about tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, among other things.
According to a survey carried out by Aalto University and researchers from Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive image among Japanese people compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need clearer unique attractions of Finland, and this revant has enormous potential.
Nights spent by Japanese tourists have grown considerably more in Finland than the other Nordic countries.
Last year they spent more than double as many nights in Finland as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are of interest to Finnish tourism as a target group because they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese used 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
The British had to settle for the silver rugby-7 when Fiji's team won the gold.
The impressive success of the seven players in the Rugby Championship in Great Britain was crushed when Fiji won it on Thursday in the finals at the Rio Deodoro Stadium between 43 and 7.
Fidzi gave the master's lesson in ball handling, transfers, side strokes, support, running lines and raw, and won gold – if there was the first Olympic medal in its entire history.
The loss meant silver, which was a bit thiner comfort for Britain, because it was the third silver day of the country. They could be proud of their success in the first Rugby-7 tournament of the Olympics, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
In the 7-5 semifinals of South African boxes, a strict victory could have had a negative impact on the team in the finals on the same day.
Despite this, the Fiji team in this form would have won the British, even if the 15-person team had been in full power.
The fact that at least one Britishman will have a gold medal in his neck tomorrow may be a comfort to the United Kingdom: Mr.Fidz's head coach Ben Ryan, former English Rugby-7 coach from Wimbledon.
It's been quite an experience for Britain.
Eight years ago, in Ryan's training, they lost all the games at the Adelaide Sevens tournament.
In Rio, they lost only one game.
The loss is painful, but progress is shocking.
Fidzi was a great starter and introduced his anti-attack skills to Great Britain as a pleasure.
It looked as if Captain Tom Mitchell and his team had run into mobile buses, and world champions took five to zero in the corner of Osea Kolinisau.
With four minutes in the clock, Jerry Tuwai scored another goal on the right.
The situation between 12 and 0 and Great Britain had hardly touched the ball.
Mitchell’s wonderful tac, which prevented the shocking Leone Nakarawa from making a third goal, did not slow down Fiji’s performance for long.
After seven minutes of the game, Jasa Veremalua scored in the right corner, after which the United Kingdom lost 17-0.
Nakarawa scored the second goal of a further start, when the first half of the game had more than one minute left.
After this Vatemo Ravouou crashed into the British team through the more powerless attacks and rushed across the finish line.
After the paint kick, the opening session ended between 29 and 0.
It seemed that the Fijians were born to play the seven players’ rugby, while the Brits are still in the role of the apprentice.
Which is very true.
During the half-time, Britain made major changes and managed to arrest the Fijian whole four minutes, which was a good performance compared to the first half, until Josua Tuisova scored thanks to the excellent team game of Fijins.
Dan Norton managed to narrow down by scoreing the left corner of the British 36-7, but long ago the game had been lost to the islanders of the South Sea, whose fans sang, waving flags and dancing.
It was hard not to admire Fiji’s purely joyous attitude.
Mata Viliam made the finals for the Fijian cake by making a final goal in the last few moments.
The whistle rings, the Fijians embraced each other, and the British fell on the field, completely crushed.
In the past day, Fidzi had won the Japanese semifinal by 20-5 and Great Britain had moved past South Africa in a tight semifinal where the balance was solved by the UK goal.
Kyle Brown took South African Boxers in the first half of the time, but Dan Norton crossed the line with his dazzling footwork and crashed under the goal pins in the second half of the time.
Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony Watson, who is the 15 players in England, sealed the victory and finally the silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer encouraged Helen Glober and Heather Stanning to row gold.
It's not like there's any gold in these races that's more emotional than that.
On the first bet, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning rowed the history with 220 winning bets and found an extra purpose for their golden moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
Although there were two in the airs, the third coach Robin Williams sounded in the boat, who encouraged them to take their second consecutive Olympic gold in the twins of women, making them the first women in the history of British sports, reaching a similar achievement.
Their power was undisputed, the victory for them was already 39 consecutive and once again recordable.
What we see is not entirely in line with the nature of success.
There are a great number of helpful hands behind each rowing gold, each of which has contributed to the twin towards achievements. However, the most important of the assistants is a coach who diagnosed cancer 30 months ago and who did not know if he would see this day.
Williams said the situation was tight at the time.
"I had bladder cancer, and the tumor was able to be cut off.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
And the situation would have been pretty bad.
It changes the way of thinking."
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The triangle was fortunate that Williams was able to start his treatment outside the season of the species at the beginning of 2014, when the interruption caused as little harm as possible if, under such circumstances, you can even say.
"I needed money, so I had to heal quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around section 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said that a few steps would be enough.
That's where it starts.
The row itself is already a journey, but this made it a little bigger."
Immediately after the victory, the twin’s thoughts were in Williams, who had spent a nervous morning talking a little bit more than normal in trying to overcome his own unrest.
Captain Stanning of the British Royal Artillery, who had a tour of Afghanistan behind him, says: "At a certain level I have been in ruins this week, which may be a little extreme, but it means so much."
"It's just telling me how much this means to me and how much work we've been working with Helen and Robin.
For the last three years, Helen and Robin's cash has been fantastic.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be doing anything, so incredibly great thanks to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have hoped for a better person to train with or a better coach."
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any competition in the last five years.
The twin has found an overwhelming rhythm that their competitors have failed to compare.
Even at the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Danish twins began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had additional resources.
"We were very attached in a moment.
Helen says, "Stay with her, stay with her."
It's very important not to get off the road."
"We managed to leave well, and at the same time we did not try to do anything wonderful.
We didn't want heaven today, we just wanted to make a good row and win the race we did."
The twin will think a year before deciding on his future.
Glover will be celebrating next month with Steve Backshall, who is familiar with the television nature programs.
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last race.
It would have brought too much pressure."
"It took me about six months after London before I realized I was the Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
It took about four minutes to figure it out this time.
This feels so much better," he says.
Iceland will change the government of the Panaman leaks
Iceland will hold an early parliamentary election in October, which will already be called for by the protestors in Panama's data leaks in the spring.
The so-called Panaman papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians had circumvented taxes by means of tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but it was not enough for protestors.
His successor Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson promised to hold a new parliamentary election in the autumn.
The election day has now been decided on 29 October.
Analysts indicate that it is difficult to predict how much the public's last spring rage affects the election result of the autumn.
In the Presidential elections in June, the criticism of the authorities was clearly visible, and Gudni Johnson was elected President from outside the policy.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed to be the founder of Obama Isis.
The U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump withdrew his latest coup.
He said that he was sarcastic in claiming that the sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organisation Isis and the candidate for democracy, Hillary Clinton, involved in the establishment of the organisation.
The Democratic Party was angry with the speeches and asked Trump for forgiveness.
As commander of the Army, we should never let anyone who can sink down like that, Clinton, into your suite.
In southern France, the Mayor of Cannes has banned the use of burkini swimwear, which is preferred by Muslims, says, among other things, the British magazine Guardian.
The decision, signed by Mayor David Lisnard, states that going to the beaches and swimming areas is prohibited for all who do not have a good manner and a bathing suit that respects secularism.
The decision also states that swimwear, which largely express religious ties, can increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into the crowd celebrating the French National Day.
At the end of July, two extremities connected to Isis attacked the church in northern France and killed an 80-year-old priest.
The quality of the bathing waters in the Oulu area passed through the sieve - the Blue Sage in the Lake of Pyykös
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only Bluefinch has been observed on the shore of Lake Pyykösjärvi.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environmental Action took water samples from nine EU coasts and 30 other public bathing areas in the Oulu region.
With the exception of the coast of Meriniemi, the concentrations of all E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in bathing waters in bathing areas were below the operational limits laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and enterococ concentrations of the seaside bathing area were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the operational limits.
The blue sage found on the shore of the fishing lake does not yet make the water swimming-free, but under favourable conditions, the situation can quickly change into a blue-shoeed flower, making the surface blue green with a lush mass of rest.
The environmental action will follow the situation through increased inspections.
In the event of a change in the Bluefinch, the reporting table of the bathing area shall also be notified separately.
See the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK’s Hakkarainen Forest Gift Reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside
The reduction in forest gifts is one of the tax changes in the Ministry of Finance's proposal for next year's budget.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax reduction to be granted on the basis of the gift tax on the generational change of forest holdings.
In the proposal of the Ministry of Finance, the reduction of forest gifts has four objectives: to promote the generational changes in forest holdings, to stimulate the age structure of forest owners, to increase forest size and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
A forest owner would reduce the net profit of forestry.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote the generational exchange of forest holdings is good, commenting on the Forest Director Juha Hakkarainen’s Central Association of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, the Hakkainen finds a critical change in the proposal.
The reduction in forest gifts is presented as a task for the forest owner’s pure capital income.
It is a capital income that has been deducted from all other deductions.
In the view of the MTK and Hakkarainen, the effectiveness of the tax reduction would be greater if the reduction could be made directly from the sales result of the wood.
The proposal by the VM leaves it to reduce the net income of forestry by preventing the loss of the capital income of forestry, which would be deducted from other taxation.
Such a person would benefit from the tax even if the wood was not sold.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner can't figure it out, says Hakkarainen.
In addition, the model applies only to a small proportion of forest owners.
The tax reduction limit linked to forest income is EUR 40 000.
It's been pulled too high for Hakkarainen.
As such, he said that 82 percent of Finnish forest owners were cut off from the circle.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of forest owners, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of farming.
In forest policy, the reduction of forest gifts has been taken by Hakkarainen for decades.
It is driven by the ageing of forest owners.
According to the MSK, the average age of forest owners is currently more than 60 years and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful rave surprised the motorists at Himanga... two cars went down into a ditch and ran into each other.
A special chase happened on Friday morning in Himanga, Kalajoki.
According to the rescue department, two consecutively upgraded cars went into a ditch, after which the behind came across the one who was running after them.
According to the chief firefighter Harri Pyyht, the fall into a ditch is suspected to have been caused by a severe rave.
There were two people in the back of the car that were both transported to the hospital for treatment.
There's no more accurate information on their injuries.
The driver of the above-mentioned car was not injured.
The accident occurred on highway 8 from Himanga to Kalajoki for a few miles.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to develop cancer treatments more effectively.
The findings made by academic professor Johanna Ivaska’s study group show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the malignancy of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to ivaska, the growth of cancer was prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue around the cancer to the normal soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer medications may be improved by focusing on the interaction between the cancer cells and the surrounding tissue.
The results have been published on 4 August in the highly respected Nature Communications in the field of cell biology.
The mute family death tree continues in court, the prosecution also demands a murder sentence for the other unsub.
The framework for the family death of a muhos continues in the court for both convicted.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for the death of a family home in Muhos.
One received eight years of murder and gross robbery, including as a young person, for example.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for the murder and gross robbery committed as a young person.
The person convicted of killing was also convicted of a serious endangerment of road safety as a young person and of the right to drive a vehicle as a young person.
The judgment of the district court was appealed to by the prosecutor, the prosecutors and the man who received a more severe sentence.
The D.A. claims a lower penalty to punish a man for murder as a young person for 12 years in prison.
At the time of the act, they were fully understood.
According to the Circumstances, 17-year-old youths killed a man who worked as the director of the child protection unit of the school home in July last year.
The 17-year-old who was sentenced to murder attacked the pilot on the couch of the living room.
The director had come out of the grip and put a young man in his room, when one of the young people hit him with a vacuum tube.
Among other things, the director was strangled, hit and kicked in the head.
According to a state of mind study, both condemned at the time of action were fully understood.
According to the law, young people had planned to escape from the family home, at least from the previous day.
Ice shark is the longest vertebrate in the world, growing only at 156 years of age
The world's longest living vertebrate has been confirmed by an ice shark, says research published in Science magazine.
In the north of the Atlantic, like an ice shark floating around Greenland, or a holler can live up to 400 years of age.
A female is only growing when she's 156 years old.
The fact that it only grows a centimeters a year adds to the ice age.
Only one species of bivalve molluscs is known to live longer than the ice sharks.
Researchers discovered the age with a radio-carbon drive.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
On the basis of these, scientists were able to assess the age of sharks.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years, though, in the direction of a throw or another can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as an economic visa - People's News
The United States of Donald Trump does not need to change the world.
Even a third of the State's total tax revenue would be lost if the change to corporate tax driven by Donald Trump was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular with tax relief that benefits the richest.
Trump described his tax programme as revolutionary when he introduced it on Monday in Detroit.
Corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
Without collecting it, there would be a huge amount of $1,000 billion a year.
The top tax rate is now 39.6, after the discount proposed by Trump 33.
They'd give up the inheritance tax completely.
Trump accused the state of over-regulation and bankruptcy of small businesses.
The environmental standards decided on by the emergency must be renewed and the energy regulation must be removed.
The health reform of Barack Obama needs to be re-examined.
The administration must be called 'experts instead of bureaucrats'.
According to Trump, a 'harmful' trade policy is the main cause of the problems in the United States.
We'd be getting rid of our free trade agreements.
45% of imports from China and 35% of Mexico would be reduced.
We'll offer you a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our creed, Trump declared.
The United States of America, Donald Trump, does not need to change the world:
American cars will drive in the streets, American aircraft will unite cities, American ships to control the sea, American steel to lift new skyscrapers all over the country.
By contrast, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by the assistants, even though well - organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
The economists - including those close to the Republicans - see Trump's program taking the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton released its own program early on Friday Finnish time.
Attack from the Past - People's News
The sea is fatal, but the real wave of attack strikes in the middle of the street of Madrid - an account with the past can begin.
That summed up Pedro Almodóvar's novelty story.
Almodovar's previous guidance The Travel Lovers (2013) were a little fun and a raging satirical comedy, preceded by the Skin where I live (2011) at the top of my Spanish career.
In parallel, Julieta (2016) is somewhere between those two works.
It's a cohesive inner love, relationship and family drama centred on the mother-daughter relationship.
It's a simple story, and we'll see a lot of things as a long guarantee.
Life seems to be a model for the middle-aged nominal person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the subsequent references to random encounters, a new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) may be amazed to the end of the film.
In the form of a guarantee and a long letter, Julieta once became an adult to her daughter.
He begins from the time before the birth of his daughter, from the moments when he met this coming father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adrina Ugarte, who is a young teacher in Julieta, is the second main woman, and she is a TV friend of the series "Smämmelte" (2013-2014).
Julieta's ageing has been dealt with in a way that can be considered as a poo, but I would say that it's a bit strange and literally one-off.
For Almodóvar films, there is often a fair distance to such a characteristic of the slopingness of the humor in Julieta.
It is an equally played, controlled, place in some places with good music and quite sad movie, which has elements for elegia.
On the other hand, the Spanish director has a typical visual appearance and begins to inject a little quietly into the eye as more of a pure form than a functional dramatic means of action.
People in the film are subjected to illness, death or otherwise only sudden loss, but the surface remains equally Korean.
This applies in particular to clothing: in the case of a nominal person, you change from scene to scene, and the same applies to visible ears.
Almodovvar is precise in these matters, but the main issue is that the seizures of the current scene are not particularly improving.
Mechanically, when the impression is repeated, it is extraordinarily and slightly non-spiritual.
Almodóvar has written the manuscript on the basis of three novels of the Canadian Alice Munro, awarded at Nobel 2013.
Novellit is published in Karkulainen: Reports.
Almodóvar has invested in the dialogue, resulting in a bit of rectified literary filmmaking.
The materials would have been emotionally incredibly steeper than the drama, so much big things, especially the pale guilt, the theme of the movie.
Control and manuscript: Pedro Almodvar.
Based on three novels from Alice Munro.
Mainly Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The first night of the film is 12.8.
Government is trying to run the election game - People's News
No new cuts will be made, the ministers will say so, so that the basic Finns do not collapse altogether.
However, the operations decided in the spring will be carried out at the top of the market.
There will be no new surgery.
The already decided savings of four billion will be sufficient.
This is how Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Minister of Finance Petter Orpo (cf.).
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the proposal by the VM, since the social security cuts were already decided in the spring frame.
Children's pensions, national pensions, basic unemployment security and nearly all other benefits linked to the national pension index are cut by 0.85%.
The duration of unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 to 400 days.
Training operations continue.
The municipals are haunted
Why are ministers so hard to stress that there will be no further cuts on these?
Because next year is the election year.
The municipalities will be held in April and they will be the main heat meter of the parliamentary term, not the gallupes.
It has been seen before that a municipal income which takes the different directions of the government parties is ruining the government's atmosphere for a long time.
However, Gallup reports that basic Finns from the Government Party are expected to lose their lives, although the result of its previous elections was modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, based Finns received 752 new delegates, a large part of whom will be realised next spring at the price of influence in the right-wing government.
The lifeline of the three large parties’ government is based on the survival of the basic Finns.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those voting for the party have had enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's visits have also come to the surface.
There will be no further cuts, firstly, the fact that next year they will be made harshly and, secondly, they will try to soften the expected attack on the basic Finns.
Majors in 2018?
In a year's time, everything will probably be different if Sipila's government is still standing.
The government has set itself the goal of depreciating debt in this parliamentary term, but next year, the Petteri Orpo's draft budget will be EUR 5.9 billion, more than this year.
After the municipal councils, the government has two options.
The first is to put your hands up in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to follow its own programme: debt is not skilled or even slowed down.
The other one is to hold on to the program.
It means newer cuts on former ones in the 2017 budget deficit.
The budget would at least be spent close to balance during 2018, and then in the spring the Parliamentary elections will receive what will happen.
indebtedness with these measures will not be affected
It is quite clear that the current measures do not have the potential to indebtedness, even though Juha Sipilä is trying to perpetuate a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by Secretary of State Martti Hetemäen at the information session of the budget prove it irresistibly:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be overoptimal, i.e. no veto aid from the international economy.
Since the collapse in 2008, Finland's national economy has not risen much further than the temporary recovery policy in the early 2010s.
In this decade, unemployment has increased by 35%, extending from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion more per year than in 2008.
In the curves presented by seven, government debt, which exceeded the 60 % threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% in the middle of the next decade.
What's responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt relief from the Left Union was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, unemployment will cost some EUR 6 billion, which will in practice be covered by a completely new debt.
This is the view of the centre, the assembly and the basic Finns of what is responsible.
Question: A lot of tasks are to be left to the municipalities
Three out of four consider that the organisation of day care, youth work and exercise of children is the responsibility of the municipality, as shown in the study of KKS - Kunnallisala’s Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people are also responsible for libraries, culture, civil education, building supervision, upper secondary school education and waste management.
In turn, the responsibility of the county is more clearly sought for regional development, special medical care, vocational training, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for disabled people.
No tasks in the order of the municipalities are to be transferred to the State.
A minor drink ran after the chase and ended up running the police.
A 16-year-old motorcyclist in Joensuu drove a police patrol out of Joensuu on Friday night at half a.m.
The police patrol tried to stop the motorbike without lights, but the young man left to drive the police away at fair speed.
The back road continued on the Sokajanranna road, from which to Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle got out of the road.
After this, the young man ran away, but the faster the police ran into the fugitive.
The blow test for the driver showed 0.75 millimeters.
He also had no driver's license to drive a motorcycle.
The case is being examined, inter alia, as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck in the stone truck fell into a ditch.
The truck in the stone truck fell into a ditch in Lake Knevijärvi on Thursday night at 21.15 p.m.
The truck had run out of the road in the bending corner to the left and fell on its side of the well.
The rescue unit raised the injured driver through the door above the fallen truck together with the rescue helicopter staff and the first carers.
It was the car owner's responsibility to lift it.
In the fallen truck, hydraulic oil was poured into the road by a rescue plant that sucked into the peat.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared this afternoon in the Air River.
A 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in Lahtinkyla, Lahdenkyla, South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for a woman about five feet [ 165 cm] long, thin, and kind, with white hair below her jaw.
Observations and clues on missing movements are requested to call the Ostrobothnia Status Center's hotline number 0295440513.
The elements of the major accident in the air - see the gallery on the destruction of Parafest
The flooding current from the parafest festival tents caused massive damage.
Arto Pippuri, Chairman of the Joensuu Paraphesy, estimates that the festival will be able to reach its feet economically, and the event will be held next year.
The last performer of the Parafest, Kalle Salonen, appeared at the end of Friday night on the market.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with presentations at the theatre venues starting at 13.00.
The Art Centre in Ahjo is a Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The programme will be organised as planned.
The discharge flow occurs in the thunder cloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a fall in air flow.
The changes in the condition of the water in the thunder cloud bind heat, and thus the falling air cools and speeds up toward the earth.
It is reported from the Department of Meteorological Sciences that there are several flooding flows in Finland during the summer.
It's hard to predict the course of the crash currents.
The crash flow hit the Joensuu Art Museum, which was the scene of Parafest, in the backyard on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents went down, there were about 200 people in the tents.
In an accident, four persons were mildly hurt.
There was one child in the group who was slightly injured to follow-up treatment.
Air pollution aging in London
According to the study, the skin of the lontos will grow older than usual.
The cause of skin ageing is air pollution.
The English survey is described in the Evening Standard.
The British skin treatment company Caci analyzes London without the most toxic particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that many pensioners in London have two and a half years older skin than those living in rural areas.
The skin - ageing particles are a very fine dust pollution that comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to Evening Standard, die of nearly 9,500 lontos every year.
Studies have shown that particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
The Cac study found that early ageing is a risk, especially for those in London who walk their way to work near congested streets.
People in London can try to protect themselves from air pollution by, for example, various masks, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
Tractor brakes failed the man standing in front of you.
He had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and went in front of it, the brakes failed and the tractor poured over the man.
The man did not fall under it, but the tractor was able to push the man enough to be transported to the central hospital as seriously injured in further investigations.
The tractor didn't have time to flow any further, as it ran into the stones in front of it.
The Riding With New Power for the coming Season
The League-Riento Riverman, who plays in the volleyball Championship, leaves a series that starts in October from a better starting point than a man-to-man memory.
The team's been together for three weeks.
The common tune is sure to be found better than in previous periods, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
Jani Sääsä, who continues to be the head coach of the joy, calls the new team entrepreneurial and united.
Out of the three foreigns, Fred Musoni will begin his second term in Rienna.
The new face is 23 years old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who's been on Rwanda's national team, is a 205-inch hacker.
Garchet is respectively a passar, and the Brazilian has a size of 198 cents.
To the U.S. national team through Josban, Kataja and River Sons
Anne Juppinen has played in almost all the gym band's World Cup since 2003.
Now Tampere is already the sixth race, only 2013 was missed after Canada had been better off in North America.
I was working in Turku and playing with the women there when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was about to set up a salibandy country team.
I was interested, and here we are, Juprine, 48, says.
He was born in 1967 near New York City of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was a year old.
In 1987, Juppinen entered the University of Joensuu to study data processing.
When I came to Joensuu, such a species was not yet played on the MS level as a salibandy.
It was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later hockey in the River Boys in the SM series, Juppine remembers.
With the university playing the salibandy SM series between 1991 and 1992, the following three went into Josba.
Besides playing, he trained the company's A-girls for the championship.
The women's SM serial career peaked in 1995.
All in all, Juppinen played in the women's SM series through 10, and the balance came up in 169 matches 51+34=85.
The latest MS period is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Vänänen were appointed to the national team
The Joensuu Salibandy Society Josban raised Perttu Puska and the Enola based Tatu Vänänen were elected to the Finnish Country Team, which will play in the Czech Brnon EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
In Helsinki, Perttu Puska, an attacking 25-year-old, has played this game before six men's field matches, where he has accumulated total power points 9+4=13.
The 32-year-old defenseman of the Swiss Wiler-Ersigen Tatu Vänänen has recovered from the passenger rug and is part of the country team's standard equipment with 117 ground fighting experiences.
The country team was also named Mika Kohonen, the co-op player of the Seinajoki Gamesmen, who was last seen in the Finnish shirt last time in the World Cup last December.
The head coach of the Salibandy County Team is Petri Kettunen, a Conthio Bay.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes to Kouvola - SM gold missing in the award box
Essi Hasu is about to end up as a beach volley player at least temporarily after the current season.
Beach Volley Finland's championships will be decided on the weekend in Kouvola Sports Park.
During three days, medals will be played in the series of adults and young people.
In cooperation with Kouvola Ballooners and the Finnish Balloon Association, the SM finals will be eligible for the six best pairs of each series of rankings.
The local color in the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, who has been a member of the Finnish beach volley peaks for several years.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many as possible get to the audience this weekend.
I'm sure there's gonna be a great arena for the pessis stadium.
I haven't played in the adult series very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals at home angles, Hasu Tunnel.
The Kouvola area lit Hasu's spark on sport and gave good lunches to a fine hobby.
There's a lot of memories of being a child.
I started the volleyball at the age of nine in Elimäe's NMKY E-girls.
The top part is too big a sloth in the mind, the knee caps in the ankles, and the great ass lips and choreographers after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small area, the sports club was a close community in which everyone knew each other.
The group's life together created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were very active. The father of a teammate trained us, and our mother was the chairman of the company for a long time.
Essi Hasule bach volley was already a natural choice of species to counterweight the indoor volleyball.
By the 1990s, there has been a bit of music playing on the waterfront.
Action has always been active.
I also went to the junior SM tour myself thinking that one day I would be there to play.
Now, this dream comes true when Hasu plays in the weekend together with Anniina Parkkise, a pit-mountain in the SM finals.
After Riikka Lehtosen and Taru Lahti, the second-ranked double goal is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We're still missing the SM gold in the award box, Hasu throws in a mysterious way.
The presence of a weekend in Kouvola may be the last time that Hasu has ever been known to the public.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await civil work.
Yes, the international career is over after the Raceallion tournament.
Otherwise the toes will be placed on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.

Solomon’s Koli bravely left for a farmer
Agriculture as an entrepreneur means risk-taking, sweat and energy efficiency.
A young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became an farmer because he believes in a positive future in the countryside.
It was about two years ago that Koli and his little brother, Valteri Kol, began working as a successor to their home.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Starting up as a rural entrepreneur meant taking on debt and increasing the volume so that bread could come into hand from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always been happy to be on the farm, and now that I've started as an entrepreneur, I've put everything in the game.
If something starts, I think it needs to be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we left to build a driveway, and at first the bank was not excited about it.
However, I took a truly courageous part in the project, and I have been fully involved in it, says Solomon Koli and adds that he would not have acted if he had no faith in the production of pure Finnish food and in the fact that everything is going to turn to good.
The goal of Solomon Kol, who grows meat cars, is to invest even more in his own navel.
The work has produced results because Solomon Koli has been chosen among the top ten in the competition of the young food producer of the Rural Future.
He's currently competing for a possible victory.
He can vote on the website of the magazine until 21.8.

Snapchat’s anime effect is criticised as Asian caricature
Snapchat says that the filter was inspired by an anime, but some observers think it is racist.
With Snapchat’s lens tool, some 150 million daily users can change reality and play with identity in ways that approximate absurdity.
You can turn yourself into an ananax, a dog or a character in the painting of Roy Lichtenstein.
Lens are unbeautified, features-distorting tools that create more than 30 million enhanced self - control per day.
All false steps will quickly become public knowledge.
Snapchat lenses have received criticism in which it has been accused of favouring blackface makeup or bleached skin shades as a beauty concept.
So when it offered to some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes into bad eyes, false teeth, and made cheeks of them, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people ("yelllowface").
The critics also wondered whether these repeated conflicts refer to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.
News and rage spread widely on Wednesday and were written by e-mails The Verge and Motherboard on the day after Snapchat said he had removed the filter.
The company explained this: the lens was designed to honor anime characters, not the caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some were passionately denying anime comparison.
Korean-American art student Grace Sparani, whose twite images were widely distributed, said in her e-mail that the lens was "at least offensive and awkward".
He adds: "It is difficult to dispute the paralleling of a very tasteless Asian caricature with filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not only a "yelllowface", but was taken to a defamatory extreme."
Snapchat is not the only company to avoid these cultural traps.
The American culture seems to have an endless struggle for diversity and social inclusion from corporate governments to Hollywood and the equipment we carry with us.
The public in Snapchat is composed of young people who are more diverse from ethnic backgrounds than their parents' response, which may mean that they are likely to expect discretion even more.
"When one of Snapchat's lenses creates a picture that offends the user, this type of thing is no longer easily missed, as previously," said Katie Zhu, 25-year-old at an interview on Thursday.
Zhu, as Product Manager and Designer, decided on Thursday to remove his Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In his article and phone interview in the medium he said that he believed that ethnic conflict reflected the lack of appreciation for diversity in Snapchat's recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the company for most of its white and exclusively male management and concluded his writing with Hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It is either so that there are no colored people in their unilateral staff who can make such decisions, or they also have colored workers, but their position is not such that they dare to express their views directly and easily," says Chinese-American Zhu.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to reply to the claim.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its staff, claiming that it is a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic background of its staff, but according to its informant, the company has recently hired a recruiter with the aim of focusing on under-represented groups of people and promoting inclusion within the company.
For its part, Zhu says that he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds, "I wonder if they really need more users like us to say that this is not OK."
According to Congress's expert group, military officials were falsifying Isis intelligence.
On Thursday, the Congress's expert group published a report that officials from the United States armed forces, Central Command, changed their intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war against Isis in Iraq and Syria than what the events on the ground gave rise to.
According to analysts, the senior military authorities were embellished by the American activities against ISIS.
The Central Command, in short, Centcom, is the headquarters of the United States Armed Forces in Tampa, the state of Florida, responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence reports adopted by the senior leaders of Centcom generally gave a more positive picture of US counter-terrorism than the facts on the field showed, and were more positive, with no exception, than in the analysis of the other units of the intelligence community", reports the press release on the report.
"Centcom's events cannot be accepted – our soldiers suffer when the high-level political decision-makers are presented with false analyses," says Ken Calvert, Republican representative of California.
"The flaws of Centcom's command line extend to the top of the organization."
The 10-page report on its scope describes in detail the continuing problems of 2014 and 2015 which are included in the Central Command's descriptions and analyses of American activities to train Iraqi troops.
Although the report does not contain decisive evidence that the reports commissioned by the Obama Administrations have been counterfeit, it gives an analytical picture of the threat posed by Isis, which gives the impression that the leaders of Centcom would have pressured them to give a more optimistic view of the threat posed by Isis.
"In the first half of 2015, many of the press releases, statements and statements given to the Congress by the Central Command were much more positive than the events actually were," says the report.
"For example, Centcom's official publicly declared that a major military attack to take back Mosul could already take place in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under Isis' control.
"After months of research, this is very clear," says the Republican representative of Kansas Mike Pompeo in the press release.
"From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the senior intelligence officers of the United States armed forces manipulated the intelligence obtained to reduce the threat to Isis in Iraq."
The Republicans set up a working group when they learned of the suspicions raised by analysts that data on the personal data would have been manipulated.
The report published on Thursday will follow more closely, as studies will continue.
In addition, the Ministry of Defence Oversight has launched an investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, the Democrat Members of the Committee for the Exploration of the House published their own results, which were partly in line with the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
" Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an over-limited process to evaluate intelligence on ISIS and Iraqi security forces," says Adam B. Schiff, the Committee's high-level Democrat.
According to Schiff, this process was "prohibited by the publication of intelligence results," "damaged the morals of analysts" and "inadequately different views".
However, according to Schiff and the Democrats, there was no evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom's analysts to adapt their conclusions to "predetermined or political official lines".
The news site Daily Beast reported on Tuesday the preliminary results of the Congress investigation.
Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon Oversighter, which was initiated as a result of actions brought by the Centcom analysts.
The Pentagon informant, Lieutenant Patrick Evans, in his announcement, says that the Ministry of Defence will not comment on Congress's report as long as an inspector's investigation is ongoing.
However, he says: "Customers sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these key issues of national security."
In addition to its efforts to determine whether the United States-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (an argument made by several defence authorities).
However, the arguments put forward last year could call into question how much President Obama can trust Central Command and give honest assessments of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of personal intelligence is in line with the differences that occurred over a decade ago when Centcom's intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study that, despite the protests of many analysts, the government of President George W. Bush supported only small troops in Iraq and used only a little time to reflect on the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against Isis intelligence.
According to the authorities, last year, the Hooker Group concluded that, despite the opposite public statements, air strikes at the refineries controlled by Isis had not significantly undermined the terrorist group's economy because it had built temporary refineries and was able to sell oil in the dark market.
However, the outcome of the investigation was not transmitted outside the Central Command, reported in September of The Times.
The former commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised last year after many legislators had estimated that the testimony to the Senate was too positive for the war.
General Austin retired in April, and his replacement as commander of the Central Command was General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States will win the fourth duel of women's groundhockey and will establish its position in the fight against Britain.
After three goals were won, the first two goals were won on Thursday, when the United States won India, by Katie Bam.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but the 27-year-old Bam was not sure whether he had previously succeeded in the same way.
"I have no idea," he says.
"I don't belong to people who like what they do with paints."
However, he knows this: the Americans have won four games in their Olympic tournament and lost zero games and will share the first place in their group with Britain, which continued to win their winnings on Thursday in Japan chapters 2-0.
Britain and the United States play opposites on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Each team survived the final match, which will decide which of the six teams will be the first and the second.
The first is to avoid a longer time with a hard - held Dutch team that won another Read.
Despite Saturday’s play, the Americans have already voiced their unexpected success in these races, four years after it was the last of the 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on the team in London, too.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, for the first time only at the age of 3 (his parents played a kind of twin in Drexel). At the age of 16, he was the youngest national team player of all time.
The 2008 Olympic Games missed him when he did not survive the final list of players.
Then came the 2012 competitions, in which he and his team were hardly successful.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an English coach, was appointed, after which things began to change.
"The change was cultural, mental and physical," says Bam.
"Our job in London wasn't what it is now.
We've made a full translation."
On Thursday night, Bam opened the goal line during the first half of the time by hitting the ball near the corner with a knock-out.
India had entered the game without any winning, but it proved to be a surprisingly tough opponent and maintained 1-0 until the third period, when Bam entered the field.
Bam carried the ball along the left side of the field for a long time, rolled to the midfield, hit the ball into the finish line and took the Americans two to 0 into the lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored her final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The game was the first in the tournament, where the U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games, the American goal had been sunk in each one.
Briggs is now living his success story,
Just like Bam.
"Our investment is now good," says Parnham, but how good, it depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
In the middle of the Olympic hulina, trampolin brings zen
Regardless of the location and time, the Olympics will inevitably run into each other.
The events, competitions and struggles in Rio de Janeiro seem to be the next intense message constantly and everywhere.
It is as if the Olympic fire itself was a flaming messenger, moving from a bowie to a swimmer, a swimmer to a gymnast and a gymnast to a triathlonist.
You can't open TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in line, without avoiding hearing Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
The first time in the Olympics, Dooley smiled with his smile and might well be a name on all his lips that would appear and be part of the best watch and listening time, would be preferred by sponsors and would appear in TV commercials of a good mind if he were just a swimmer, a gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, from the California Lake Forest, 28, competes with the Olympic gold trampoline.
The Olympic Fire does not give equal light to all competitions.
Farthest from the center, partly in the shadows are less well-known sports, such as air guns, bows, featherball and taekwondo.
We'll always have a breast bath, and let the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I'm allowed to write a humble story about my own special favorite, I'd like to draw attention to the restrained charm of trampolin.
Although trampolin has been an Olympic species since the 2000 Sydney Games, its visibility for the last 16 years has been so limited that many people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic species.
Ignorance can be regional.
Of course, athletes from the United States have participated in the Olympic trample, but the country has never made it to the medals and has never made it to the finals until 2012.
In men's trampolin medals appear to be going to the Chinese and Russians, and on the women's side the medals are blatant Canadians.
The Dong Dong in China and the Canadian Rosie Maclenna will defend the gold medals they won in London this year.
Trampoliin, however, has the charm of the defendant, partly because it sounds more suitable for the circus school than for the Olympics.
(I acknowledge in this connection that I am not an expert, only an ordinary fan.)
There is a comical potential in the species that has been used in the cartoons for endless continuous bouncing of characters, but it also has the same dignity as in gymnastics and swimming, i.e. the species that are essentially connected in the trampoline.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means the "strandboard".
Honorable masters jump with a huge trampolin, which leaves them at a height of nearly 10 metres. Before landing, jumpers must make a series of acrobatic movements, such as spins, skills and volts.
According to the official Olympic programme, jumps are assessed on the basis of performance, severity and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 different countries compete for the trampoline team championship, 16 of which are men and 16 of whom are women.
The most common direction of the Olympic Games is straight ahead.
When reaching for gold, the medallions must go further, faster, up and above, sometimes across the line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
In addition to the paint line or the starting wall, they also have a second objective that they pursue in televisiond reports, namely a world record or an Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is lofty, admirable, even fanatical — and even enough to get a viewer to tears.
But I also find this a little exhausting in just watching the competitions.
This is where the trampolin offers a rest period.
Trampoliin's heading upwards.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast will go up weightless as an astronaut, fall down, and blush back up effortlessly.
Of course, it also includes a competitive aspect, and it is not easy either, but it does not involve an intense rush to the finish line or jumping far, only a sleepy and melting combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to zen as the Olympics can be.
Women's fights and finals will take place on Friday afternoon and start at 13.00 local time and the men's match will take place on Saturday at the same time.
NBC sends the finals as part of its afternoon shipment, which starts at 14.00 local time on either day.
In the midst of Olympiaman, there is a peaceful and wonderful moment that might be missed in the midst of a common crayon.
And if awareness can only be increased by providing attractive male athletes and objectifying them – as the US male gymnasts recently suggested – then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his fascinating new group of fans.
A whole generation protests in Ethiopia, a long-term ally of the United States
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
Government forces have violently broken down demonstrations of political change across Ethiopia.
According to witnesses, several protestors have been shot to death in conflicts with the police.
Is Ethiopia falling apart?
For the last decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries and a reliable Western ally whose economy has grown rapidly.
In recent months, however, the country has been shaken by anti-government demonstrations that are spreading to more and more large areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed to the streets, calling for profound political change.
According to human rights organisations, the government's reaction was ruthless.
Witnesses say the police shot and killed a number of unarmed protestors.
It is assumed that the videos of demonstrations at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year will show how the security forces are beating young people on fire who have been forced to stand against the wall.
The leading UN human rights officer is now calling for in-depth research.
"It has always been difficult to keep the country united, and it is even more difficult to move forward," says Rashid Abdi, Research Director of the International Crisis Group in the Horn of Africa.
Since Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa, whose stability has been promoted by the Western countries.
The US Army and Intelligence are very close to the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, especially in Somalia, and only a few African countries, if anything, will receive so much assistance from the West.
The Ethiopian economy has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has been radically improved, and Addis Ababa, the capital, is even a new agglomeration.
The streets of the cities are usually peaceful, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still a long way from a democracy model, and human rights organisations have been constantly reporting government repression policies, the opposition in the country is very limited and dissidents are quickly suppressed.
Many people have been banished, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the wilderness.
But the situation may be changing.
"If the people are repressed and have no choice but to show their minds, it will fall out," says Seyoum Teshome, a professor at the University of Central Ethiopia.
"All young people express their opinion.
A whole generation protests."
There are many subjects of dissatisfaction, from land use to the repression of the government coalition.
After the widely criticised elections last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last place previously owned by the opposition, as a result of which they now rule Parliament as a whole.
At the same time, tensions are growing on the Eritrean border, where hundreds of deaths were needed in the battle in June.
Analysts fear that in recent years, more or less defeated separatist groups, such as the Oromo liberation front or the Ogaden People's Freedom Front, may try to exploit confusion and rearm.
There are many reasons for why a bitter mood that has been swept beneath the surface for years will erupt right now.
The first is obviously innocent: smartphones.
Only for the last few years have Ethiopians been able to communicate in social media, as cheaper smartphones became common and internet access improved.
However, even when the government repeatedly blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many people access the Internet via brokers who hide their location.
Many Ethiopian youths reported that this was what they called people demonstrations.
Another reason is the increase in solidarity between the two largest populations in Ethiopia, the orms and the amphibians.
Oroms and amhars are not natural allies.
Amhars, mostly from Christian highlands, have long been ruling the politics and business of the country, and have taken away the orgasms, most of which are Muslims and live in the Netherlands.
But this is also changing.
"Cooperation is getting deeper and we're getting under the same umbrella," says Mulu Gemechu, Director of Oromo.
The largest demonstrations have just been in the Orom and Amhara.
Many amhars and oroms feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by the Tigre tribe, which represents only about six per cent of the population and yet controls the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause of unrest is the death of Meles Zenaw.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unsaid illness in 2012.
They thought he was a tactical genius who could see around the corner.
According to analysts, he was particularly skilled to detect the first signs of dissatisfaction and to use ambassadors who agreed on the course of the counterparties.
"The current government lacks this essential instinct," says conflicter Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, entered Meles's boots from almost unknownness.
Unlike Meles, from the Tigren region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
According to the analysts, he has no trust in the security forces of the Tigre tribe.
Many fear this means more bloodshed.
The last time there were similar riots in Ethiopia in 2005, when thousands opposed the elections, which according to analysts the government first screwed up and then stole.
In post-election unrest, many protestors were killed, although there were fewer deaths than in previous months, and the restlessness stopped relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia’s leaders for the long-term planning of infrastructure, such as the new agglomeration train, and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But the inner grudge against the Ethiopian government has clearly not prevented the gymnastics.
And the grudge is taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month in Gondar, the Amhara City, protestors attacked companies owned by tigers, and the hate speech against tigers is becoming more common in social media.
Analysts say that protests place the United States and other Western allies in a bad situation.
The US Government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned aircraft in the neighbouring Somalia, but according to the United States, the base has recently been closed.
At the same time as the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally, which is already unstable, to collapse.
"This requires strict balance," says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic when he claims to be the founder of Obama Isis
Donald J. Trump tried to pull his words back on Friday in his latest campaign, arguing that he was not serious about saying several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group Isis.
The clarification raised new questions to the Republican side about the ability of the presidential candidate to communicate clearly to the citizens of his country.
In these stormy moments, there are also his supporters who must try to defend their candidate and explain the comments he might not have meant.
Trump made a claim at the election event on Wednesday night and repeated during various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed that the President and Hillary Clinton created Isis.
In the early Friday morning, however, Trump twittered and said that his claims were sarcasm.
Trump rolled his speech in the twitter completely from the day before when he said he was seriously accused of several interviews.
When Radio Leader and Conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by saying that Obama was trying to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate refused to withdraw from his claim.
The latest storm of criticism arose when Trump tried to centralise his campaign back to the economy as the figures of support fell.
Trump and Clinton held their economic policy speeches in Michigan this week.
On Friday Trump tried to return to the subject again.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes and that Clinton's speech was boring.
Trump has defended himself with sarcasm before.
At the end of July he received broad criticism when he seemed to urge the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's e-mail. Later he explained his comments by saying, "Of course I was sarcastic."
In this way Trump stretches the limits of political speech and pulls his words back if necessary.
"I believe that it is his way of testing certain messages that respond to his supporters. He sees the reaction of the supporters to the messages, and "clears up" in one way or another depending on the reactions," says communications expert Ruth Sherman, who has observed the language used by both presidential candidates.
"But I also believe that he understands his claims and knows that they are circumcised enough to pass through different sieves."
Instead of softening his statements to the electoral audience, Trump has, in recent days, even made his style even more stickier when his support figures have continued to decline.
A new opinion poll by NBC, Wall Street Journal and Marist published on Friday said that Trump’s support is significantly lower in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while the situation in Florida is strictly even.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologizing to his provocative speeches, he often accuses his critics that they misunderstand his words or do not understand his sense of humor.
However, after increasingly careful observation of the Presidential campaign in the last few months, Trump's jokes have placed his loyal supporters in an awkward position in which they have to publicly defend Trump's comments, no matter how provocative they are.
One of Trump's most important supporters, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani strongly defended the presidential candidate at CNN's interview on Thursday.
"I consider his words to be justified, a political speech", Giuliani replied when asked whether Trump was true when he claimed that Isis was the founder of Obama and Hillary Clinton.
"It is true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organization, which Obama misguided as "the team of the lower series", and that's why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq."
Most Republicans representing the mainstream are trying to argue that the Obama regime, in which Hillary Clinton was Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed Isis to continue its activities when it did not act decisively in the Middle East.
Before Friday's election in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, where he accused them of bludgeoning his speeches and discriminatory attitude towards him.
He mocked the "unqualified and pathetic" TV comments who were trying to find out about him, but he said it couldn't be done.
Some Democrats mocked Trump's explanation and said that it would only show more clearly that he was not fit to be president.
Due to the increase in excessive rent, the coffee shop will open up in Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe was a little bumpy in Williamsburg, where only cash became a means of payment and there was no Wi-Fi, but which offered good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the cafe was priced out of its streetside on Bedford Avenue when the rent became disproportionate.
Soap Cherie, who will be replaced by Verb Cafe in the summer of 2014, sells cup-shaped soaps.
Locals view this loss of the coffee shop that had been put out of the middle-classification as a sad thing.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB Club no longer exists, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But even though New York is no longer the same, there will also be a new one.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new cafe in Greenpoint, just a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb cafe has Wi-Fi and you can pay with a credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still unrefined.
Coffee is still good, too.
The owner and manager of the new Verb cafe is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old cafe.
He started in Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to finance the opening of a new cafe, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things the same.
Verb is ordering bagels from the same supplier as before and is using the same espresso machine model.
In addition, it re-used even the old Verbi lamps.
Rodriguez says that, however, he wanted to try something new and
added new products to the list.
Bacon egg cheese-sandwichs are available, and to fill capers and browned onion rings are available.
There's also dark-man lanterns on the list.
No more beer from the coffee, but instead juices made from fresh fruit.
After nine months of having had a coffee shop, Rodriguez says that he noticed that the old regular customers began to go to Verb in a steady flow.
"Many of our old customers were also priced out of Williamsburg," he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who recently visited the cafe on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, once lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
After still moving to Greenpoint, he made a walk to the verb, which was still in Williamsburg.
When Verb was shut down, he tells me he's done with the coffee for a while.
"I knew I liked Verbi's coffee and culture," he says.
Now he's drinking coffee again, even though on that Sunday he took instead of his usual ice coffee, a chai factory, which is also listed as an extract.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, visited Verb faithfully since 2003.
He always went to the cafe before he worked, and ordered the same thing, with no exception.
"I walked into the cafe every day for 15 minutes, like a machine, and there they have already prepared my butterbage with all the fillings," he says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and bring new products to his menu.
Today Rosenthall still order its standard product, but sometimes he varies from bacon, eggs and cheese fillings of his bagel.
Rodriguez says he doesn't have a grudge that the soap store took the old place.
Soap Cherie’s owners even offered to make a special soap, which is made with Verb’s own cold roasted coffee.
"We can still take the offer," says Rodriguez.
The Polish people who traditionally lived in Greenpoint have also welcomed the cafe with joy.
One of the new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez now tells us that he is looking for a suitable place to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
A new place has brought other benefits.
The local juice company wants to bottle and sell cold-bleached coffee at the cafe.
The coffee shop may also extend to the next building.
However, it is enough for many customers to get their own old favorites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer in Williamsburg, and he says his heart was broken when the cafe was closed.
When the new place was opened and I ordered a coffee there, it felt like coming home, says Whitt.
"I needed the smell of coffee shop."
The tough food of the great recession in the new work: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat for lunch in his office room in the White House.
President Roosevelt, known as the Culinary Cross, was fond of the luxurious dishes of Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as the goose-panzer and Maryland’s turtle soup.
On that day, his menu was more modest: devil’s eggs (deviled eggs) in tomato sauce, potato juice, and after-food plump.
"It was a demonstration of culinary solidarity for the people who suffered," says Jane Ziegelman.
His husband Andrew Coe adds, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
A couple in Brooklyn Heights work as a food historian.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, tells about the Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman's latest book, called 97 Orchard, tells the story of the Lower East Side, through food.
Their new co-operation is the A Square Meal published by Harper on Tuesday, which describes the history of American food in the great recession of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity when agreeing with the supplier Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron cloud collector and opened in the same year as the great stock exchange collapse occurred in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and olive-filled sandwich and 57-year-old Coe, on the other hand, turkey, potato and mixed vegetables.
When the reporter ordered the meatloaf, the couple said it was appropriate for a very large discussion about eating the depression.
"The shrubs were very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
"The people ate peanuts, liver fractures, and beans.
They were made of substances that were cheap and sufficient.
Imagine eating so much peanuts that they will be sufficient for the entire meal."
Andrew Coe's making fun of me.
"It must have been in the stomach like lead," he says.
Before the great recession of the American dining table, especially in the countryside, worked on the buffet principle "eat as much as you want".
Women made food for farm workers, and pies were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who had sent food to the hungry Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal is a chronicle of the ways in which the people survived when they suddenly had to give up their abundance.
"This was a time when food became a key and distressing subject for the Americans" says Coe and explains why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
A new cheap diet was equally distressing: according to Ziegelman, imaginative dishes such as walnut and pasta became the main food, and the pasta was called "a powerful way to take advantage of the food stars", as cooks could cover up not so attractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
The meat, which had been the most important part of the American meal for years, became a savingly used luxury.
Strange blends were tried, where the most important was the fulfillment of calories and nutrients, and not so much the taste or even the healthy sense of the kitchen.
When making a study for a book that also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared ovens filled with peanut butters used as a shortage of food.
"It didn't get any popularity at the dinner table," says Coe, "where is it?"
Ziegelman adds, "It was unreal.
The peanut butter and the garlic are not compatible at all.
This was characteristic of many household recipes."
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, the head of the Federal Households Agency in 1923-1943, guided citizens’ eating habits in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and periodicals and encouraged women to be precise budget holders and to respond to the challenge of making carrot-creeped, delicious dishes.
The Square Meal book is a celebration of historical treats.
Particularly tasty are reports of the government's reactions to its hungry citizens, such as the "give me to eat cake" attitude of President Herbert Hoover.
While publicly praising his child’s simple food on an Iowa farm, he himself ate like a millionaire and a sophisticated gentleman who had become him.
"He liked the continental-European kitchen, like fish and cucumber sauce," says Coe.
"He ate almost in the gold-coated dining room with a tuxedo on his head.
He was completely alienated from reality."
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not encouraged him to set an example on his stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in the taste at all, the food served in the White House was not only the most boring in Washington, but also the worst prepared."
Many of the downtime dishes were abandoned as soon as the land got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of tradition continues to be reflected in how we pay attention to calories and nutrition and in how science has been applied to cooking.
When writing the book, the couple report that they have begun to understand the eating habits of the mother of Ziegelman, such as why she could not throw away food.
"He was really afraid that food would have to be thrown away," said Coe.
"The people even started to feel bad about his food," recalls Ziegelman.
"For example, once in a windmill."
After the main dish was emptied at Eisenberg’s lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe picked up at home the blizzard meal they prepared, the same thing President Roosevelt ate at his lunch.
"It's called a plump foam," says Ziegelman and adds that giving a spectacular name to the modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no cream foam, only plums, little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We haven't been able to sink our spoons in a thick brown shit.
I'm surprised it didn't taste bad.
Coe was blackmailing me for the second time and for the third time.
"The Germans would make this better," Coe says to his wife, making it sound like a positive budget manager.
Total compensation to Gilead for legal fees for the patent scheme for hepatitis C with Merck
The Court of Justice of the United States of America decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive full compensation for the legal fees incurred by it in the dispute with Merck & Co Inc, a pharmaceutical manufacturer concerning the patent for hepatitis C.
In June, Gilead was released from damages of 200 million dollars, which had been imposed on it for two patents owned by Merck in connection with successful medicines known as the Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead. The U.S. judge noted that Merck committed violations involving the guilty of false oath and other ethical practices.
In the application lodged on Thursday, Judge Beth Labson Freeman of the Court of Justice of the United States of America states that Gilead was entitled to be exempted from the legal fees it had incurred in defending the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which controls the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can treat over 90% of hepatitis C.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenged each other and demanded the private ownership of sofosbuvir under laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is the active substance in Gilead medicines.
US-supported troops have taken over the city of Manbij from Isis
The U.S. supported troops have been taken over in northern Syria, near the Turkish border, the city of Manjib, when the last extremist Isis fighters left the city, says the informant of the troops.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (DF) group is now branching the city to find the last Isis fighters hidden in the city.
A representative of the Manbij Military Council of the SDF, Sharfan Darwish, told Reuters that 2,000 hostages taken by Isis fighters have been released.
"The city is now fully in our possession, but we are still conducting search operations," said Darwish.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% of federal tax
Hillary Clinton, President of the Democratic People's Republic of Finland, published his 2015 tax return on Friday, which shows that his and his husband's income at that time was $10.75 million and that the actual federal tax rate they paid was 34.2.
In 2015, the Clintons donated a million dollars to charities, mostly to the Clinton Foundation Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton made nearly $ 5.3 million in speech fees, and Hillary Clinton, former Minister of Foreign Affairs, announced that he earned 3 million dollars from Simon & Schuster's publishing book, which dealt with his term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's vice-presidential candidate, Virginian Senator Tim Kaine, and his wife Anne Holto published ten years of tax returns.
The actual federal tax rate they paid was 20.3 in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to show a pattern for economic transparency", says Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in her release.
The perfect opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and withdraws his promises to publish his tax information.
As usual, US presidential candidates have always published their tax information, even though the law does not require it.
New York Businessman Trump and his lawyers have called on the tax administration to check and say that it is the reason Trump has not published his income data.
"Move is yours", the Clinton campaign assistant, Ian Sams, to refer to the tax data of the Democratic candidate.
On Thursday, Trump's special legal assistant Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not let Trump release his tax information until the checks were completed.
The critics of Trump, including the President of the Republic of 2012, Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said that his refusal to publish information raises questions about Trump's own capital, his grants to charity, his business relations and many other ties, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has taken this issue and published a video on Friday, on the Internet, in which he brings out prominent Republicans who are sending Trump to publish his tax information.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in his speech on the economy in Michigan.
"Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, and does not publish his tax returns," said Clinton to the crowd.
According to the Politico website, Trump did not pay taxes at all or paid only a little for the two-year period in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist quoted several tax lawyers and auditors on Friday that the situation could still be the same.
The federal tax rates have raised the central issue of the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a billionaire investor named according to Warren Buffett, which would ensure that more than a million dollars per year would pay at least 30% of the tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week at the Clinton election in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, the main office of the Berksshire Hathaway multinational company is located in the same place, challenged Trump, where they would both reveal their tax information.
Buffet says that he too has been subject to tax control and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authorities, but of voters.
The Clinton campaign has been publishing tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, who are living in Chappaqua City in the state of New York, paid on average 32 % of real federal tax between 2007 and 2014, while the actual combined tax rate they paid was about 40,5 %.
The clinton tax return 2015 shows that unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was paid.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clintons announced a dividend and interest income of $109,000.

Chili powder-filled colostrums in support of the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Naturalists in Tanzania have come up with an unusual way to keep elephants away from the human population — elephants being rushed by throwing chili-filled condoms at them.
The technology has proved to be effective, and a few years ago, the Honeyguide Foundation, together with the American Nature Conservancy, has launched a campaign to teach volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania how to protect their homes and cultures without harming their elephants.
Some time ago, spears were used to rush elephants.
Friday is the elephant day of the world dedicated to the protection of animals.
"We have seen changes in attitudes in these villages since now the villagers can rely on them to keep the elephants out of their fields without harming them," says damian Bell, Executive Director of the Honeyguide Foundation.
First, the intrudering elephant is rushed by pointing at the flashlight and playing the horn.
If this doesn't work, we throw the so-called chili cloud.
A mixture of the chili powder shall be placed in a condom together with a thread and the head of the condom shall then be rotated in such a way that only the ignition wire is left out.
When the ignition wire is lit, the condom explodes and spreads a fine chilli powder cloud into the air.
Usually one spice cloud is enough to drive an elephant away.
The last means is a throw that shoots the fireworks known as the Roman candle into the air and produces a loud and bright explosion.
The Jewish film director criticises the Berlin hotel for removing Israel’s heading number from the Arab “scoffee” – RT News
A French, rootly Jewish film director gave birth to the media when he revealed that the Berlin Kempinski Bristol Hotel did not mention Israel’s land code number in his land code list.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust Shoah document, destroyed his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
In his recent visit to Lanzmann, he tried to find the hotel in the index list offered by Israel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries to which the room can be called directly.
"How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel will be completely destroyed – as if it did not exist?"
Lanzmann's writing.
On the other hand, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through a separate call centre.
The film director asked for an explanation about the reception of the hotel.
He was shocked by the answer of the receptionist, Mr. Lanzmann.
The receptionist said that the removal of Israel from the list was a decision which was carefully considered by the management of Kempinski hotels.
The reason behind the measure was still shocking the film director.
According to Lanzmann, the official said, "The greatest part of our guests is Arabs, and they demand the removal of the Israeli heading number."
The Israeli German Ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman interviewed by Suddeutsche Zeitung said that the case was a "great disgrace".
"The opportunity to knock us all down and shock us all.
It's a great shame.
And the more shameful it is when we consider that we are in Germany and this is the hotel chain.
No further explanations are needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," says the ambassador.
The incident caused quite a counter-reaction online, where it was called a scandal.
Some accused Kempinski Hotel of simply giving in to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Hätsät" was said in a publication that highlighted the location of the hotel near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm Street.
Der Spiegel writes that the hotel has been denied charges quickly, called a mistake and apologized to Lanzmann.
"There was never a direct order to leave Israel out of the index list," writes the representative of the Hotel Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski.
It adds that the heading number has since been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to protest Brazilian students.
The students joined the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered together to express their views on government reform of the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protestors.
Melkation began when law enforcement authorities tried to break down the student population, resulting in the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the demonstration, who wanted to show their stunning to the government’s plans.
The Governor of Sao Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, has proposed a savings measure, with nearly 100 public schools closed down and 300 000 students invested in new schools.
Some protestors made graffitis on walls that were temporarily opposed to Michel Temer in charge of the President’s office.
The students' demonstration took place only a few days after the streets were filled by the successful protestors of President Dilm Rousseff, when the Senate of the country voted on this charge.
Russia-Iran trade has increased by 71% - RT Business
Since the exit of the sanctions, annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent, says Russian Iranian Ambassador Levan Dzhagarya.
According to him, the interest of Russian companies in Iran has increased since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted.
"The Russian companies continue their existing relations with Iran, while the new companies are ready to enter the market.
Still increasing trade is, of course, one of the priorities for cooperation between countries," says Dzhagaryan.
He noted that trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9 % in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and increased to USD 856,6 million.
"In particular, Russia's exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5% to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to $158 million.
Trade was speeded up by the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," says Ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
"In the last year, the Russian Foreign Service in Iran issued Iranian citizens some 35 000 visas, most of which were travel visas.
In addition, for the first time, Iran was among the 20 first countries whose citizens were travelling in Russia.
Nor is it too brave to say that the number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year," he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran, on the other hand, is relatively low, which the Ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend travelling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he says.
Scotti Callum Skinner reached the finish line when the British won the gold of cycling
The Scottish Callum Skinner lauded the reputation of the men in the team press at Rio's Velodom last night, when the British trio defended the titles earned in London in 2012.
The 23-year-old Skinner, Glasgow, was in the role of anchor, inherited by his countryman from Sir Chris Hoy, Scotland. The young man made the legend proud to thank the goal and gain the victory of the team in New Zealand.
Britain took the surprise victory four years ago when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympics.
And they repeated the trick after they had only ranked sixth in the London World Cup in March, despite the fact that Hoy had subsequently left his competitive career.
The problem between Beijing and London was replacing Jamie Staff, who specializes in the role of the first leader.
Hindes came out at exactly the right time.
Hoy’s decision to end the race path also left a gap between Kia Emad and Matt Crampton trying to fill.
The Scottish Skinner was the man whom the British coaches believed and where they saw the potential he now redeemed.
Hindes, Hoy with the championship four years ago won Kenny and Skinner made an Olympic record on time, but on the first round New Zealand was faster.
And the British trio won gold in a duel.
Hindes was right behind after his tour, but Kenny was working on the team's lead that Skinner kept.
A large part of the change was the change of the strategy so that Hindees drove to keep the speed quiet at a higher speed, which allowed Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep the speed up.
Hoy followed BBC's position as commentator and reached Skinner, Kenny and Hindes' eyes as they entered the award-winning.
The Glasgowian 23-year-old Skinner says, "I'm flattered by parallelness.
I'm just trying to do my best and to succeed.
We made an Olympic record in the finals and won the world champions.
It was amazing.
There's no better way to win it."
After winning London in 2012, Hindes, together with Kenny and Hoy, admitted to having fallen on the track deliberately due to a bad departure.
Later, he withdrew his words, and Britain’s competitors had no means of complaint.
This time, there were no problems like this with a sovereign victory.
Hindes says, "The feeling was like London, all the British flags were on the scene.
Our team has been united over the last three months.
We've lost so many world titles that victory at the Olympics seems awesome."
In other words, one race, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of ten railway tracks in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of progress over the last five months, then the successful five days will be ahead.
As Kenny has demonstrated with his abilities, it is not impossible to imagine that he will repeat Hoy's achievements and win three Olympic golds in the Olympic Games.
This would mean the accumulation of the account by six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, which is exactly 12 years younger than Hoyta and was born on 23 March (the magical date of British sports, which is also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday).
This would be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny's next competition for a sprint that starts today and solves in three days' time.
A Bolton 28-year-old Kenny says, "I can only enjoy this right now.
The team race is always the best.
You can enjoy winning together with your friends.
To win alone is a little lonely."
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must receive the value of a knight."
This was the only medal competition of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest four-man team ride.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record that was made in London in 2012 and won gold is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final (at 22.42 p.m.) will be competed today on the second day of the competition, and the focus will certainly be on Wiggins.
Yesterday he had a dispute with the competition authorities before the time limit when the operators invited him to measure his length.
In a similar competition for women, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Millgavie reached the world record time of 4:1.3.60.
The British team can now count on its great team of bikes to take responsibility for the middle stage of the Olympic Games and bring a host of medals to the country.
After truly exceptional evidence of a complete leadership in Beijing and London, expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
There have been dramas in the background, the least of which is the dismissal of technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of claims about sexism and bullying, and the conclusion of great athletes, such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton's competitors.
However, the competitions held on the first night at the Velodrome show that the already legendary reputation of Britain will be fulfilled once again at a perfect moment.
The future of the Portland fuse plant at a risk due to the end of the electricity contract
The future of the aluminium alloy in Portland, the state of Victoria, and thus the jobs of thousands of workers are at stake when the power company supplying electricity to the melting plant reported that one of the owners of the plant is breaking down the supply contract and all supply contracts are expected to be terminated.
This is the result of the decision taken previously by the Victorian Government this year not to continue the aid which will keep the plant in operation.
Fixed support for 20 years will expire in November.
The Alcoan Portland factory is in danger of losing up to 2,000 jobs.
Because of the closures, up to 2000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk.
The effect of snowball can continue to increase, as the melting plant consumes about 10 per cent of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry fuse, resulting in the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoan Portland's fuse is losing money and is in danger of having to close the door.
The measures correspond to the speculation of the future of the plant, first caused by Australia’s strong dollar and the price of recent production.
AGL, which delivers electricity to the large aluminium alloy from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says that it is also expected that three other fuse owners will cancel their contract.
The majority of the factory is owned by Alcoa and Aluminium joint venture. The Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp own minority shares in the plant.
AGL says that it is waiting for the Portland plant to continue to operate, which means that the physical demand for electricity from the melting plant will continue.
AGL states that the contracts are so-called "protection agreements" which were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The notice of termination is 12 months and will therefore expire in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL expects contracts to generate revenue in the financial year 2017," said the power plant.
The potential impact on AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards is currently limited by strong market prospects for the future in terms of wholesale electricity prices.
AGL already says that it has reduced the value of contracts in its accounts by $187 million as a "predictment for termination".
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts does not affect Alco's ... capacity to keep the melting plant operational or to secure the supply of electricity to the melting plant.
The American company reported that it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was to enter into force since November of this year, although it still needs to find out why it has now withdrawn from the agreement.
In view of the poor economic situation in the sector, analysts have been cautious about their assessment of both the melting plant in Portland, Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
Stephen Mikkelsen, the operational director of AGL, said in his speech to analysts earlier this week that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity and about 900 megawatts per year.
"If these plants leave the market, it will mean a significant fall in demand (electricity) on the market.
For us as a producer, it would not be good news," says Mikkelsen.
Kardashian TV star Kendall as the cover girl of September Vogue
The Kardashian-Jenner clan’s model and the fourth daughter of Kris, her mother and manager, Kendall Jenner, 20 poses in the famous September issue of the United States Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's advertising face and performs in Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"Looking at me in a room full of my loved ones, made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The publication of the cover picture was followed by a strange (or perhaps just following the Kardashian style of the series?), a scripted video with all the members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (bareres Rob and Caitly and everyone's favorite uncle, Ryan Seacrest, Kardashian producer) who forgot about their sister's cover. The video ends with a classic turn: they were all planning their sister's surprise party.
The plot is cliché, and it is used in almost all the stages of the program (Seacrest says the words: "Did you think we'd forgotten you?" as sincerely as the children's morning TV cartoon character), but Krisin had to somehow involve his other daughters in this publicity.
Its appearance in the September issue of Vogue will undoubtedly mean a new era of the Kardashians.
Kendall’s big sister Kim could have reached Vogue’s claim before (he appeared on the cover of Vogue together with his husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is in its own category.
The September issue is Vogue's most published year.
The number of advertisers attracts a large number of advertisers more than the number that resembles the fashion magazine (the Fashion site in Fashion reduced the number of 615 pages of the last year's 832 page study).
The September issue of the cover is expected to be published so strongly that, in the two previous years, images of the magazine have leaked to the public even before the official announcement.
Previously, the cover pattern of September was Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelil and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has been more famous than models that are famous.
The Oscar-winner and Dior-advertist Jennifer Lawrence were in the cover in 2013, and one year later the honor was given to Lady Gaga.
The magazine describes Jenner as a success model for his generation, and even though he would rather be included in the work of the model, he is, however, in rather good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of known people, true-TV stars or children today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these).
They can rightly be called talented women who succeed in entertainment beyond others.
The Beyonce in the cover picture last year has one of the strongest years of his career, when he published his Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Because of his real-time TV background, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be a pain in the ass.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model, Stephanie Seymour, criticised Jenner and her colleague, Gigi Hadid, by calling them "fuckers".
These feelings have reappeared when the news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue came out.
However, it seems irrelevant to keep up with dissatisfaction.
Kendall Jenner is the cover of Vogue's September issue.
He's a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
He walks at Marc Jacobs' fashion show.
She's the ad face of Estee Lauder makeup cream.
He and all his sisters sell images of themselves through paid applications.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which he filmed for the Live magazine.
And in his spare time, he'll be on real-time TV, maybe just a way to meet his sister and her kids.
Legal aid centres will turn 160 000 people away a year
Every year, more than 160 000 people in the most vulnerable countries will be turned away from legal aid centres, and the sector will be prepared for the effects that additional cuts will have on centres already operating at extreme limits.
In the state of Queensland, three of the five people seeking legal aid and legal services are being turned away – the majority of them are elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unwarranted abuses and similar injustices without resources.
Public legal aid services, which are already overburdened, are preparing for additional cuts in appropriations.
Starting next June, legal aid centres are in danger of losing another 30% of federal funding.
James Farrell, Director of the Queensland Public Legal Assistance Centre, reports that according to the latest calculation report prepared by the National Association of Legal Aid Centres, thousands of people are being deported annually.
If the federal government doesn't reverse its decision, Farrell says the situation will only get worse.
"Queensland Public Aid Centres are constantly underfunded, which means that thousands of people will be turned away when they seek the necessary services," says Farrell.
"The people who come out of violent relations, the people under the burden of uncontrollable and uncontrollable debt, the families who are breaking up, the workers who are unwarrantedly redundant – all of them have problems with legal matters, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The Federal Government intends to cut funding by 30% from June 2017, which means that thousands of the most vulnerable in Queensland will have to cope with complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Chancellor of Justice and Senator Queensland, George Brandis, so that these financial cuts are immediately abandoned so that people can get the legal assistance they need.
Last year, the state administration fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid financing to the national central level.
It is now time to take account of the needs of public legal aid centres and their clients, and the Palaszczuki Government must invest in this important work."
Donald Trump's campaign was prosecuted for threatening the employee with a gun.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was brought under appeal when no action was likely to be taken after the leader of the campaign had been informed that the head of North Carolina had threatened the employee with a gun while they were driving in Jeep in February.
This event is described in an action brought by Vincent Bordini, former state-owned software trainer, in the State Court on Wednesday in Charlotte.
My Bordini says that she was waiting for months for the campaign to be dealt with internally before she realized, according to her own words, that this would not happen.
My Bordini, in her complaint, says that campaign leader Earl Phillip, "take out the pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger and put the pipe in Vincent's kneecap."
Following a complaint to the local and regional management of the campaign, Bordini was informed that at least four other persons had experienced the same experience with Phillip.
"Even if you don't fire a gun, it'll cause damage," says Bordini on the cover.
The action will take place only two days after the Republican presidential candidate gave rise to a general rage when he said to the crowd in North Carolina that "the supporters of the second paragraph" – who are considered armed owners and armamentors – can take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton wins the election and gets elected judges.
According to Trump's campaign staff, the media removed his words in context and Trump did not encourage violence.
My Bordini claims compensation for the indiscretion of the campaign and Phillip for the coercion, abuse and the mental suffering caused by them.
Trump’s informant Hope Hicks did not respond immediately to the message requesting a comment.
Despite the companies, Phillip wasn't reached.
Charlotte's local news office, WCCB, told me Phillip just left the campaign.
There was no immediate response to Phillip's consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, to the request for a call.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been on a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
The British must use the Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also revives the economy and creates well-being – not only in local communities and London, but in the whole country.
As at the London Olympics in 2012, we made a huge contribution to the benefit of our nation and all of our regions.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and East End.
We will do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we create 10,000 new apprenticeships and 40 000 new jobs, thus eliminating youth unemployment in the neighbouring areas of the airport.
As at the London Olympics 2012 there are always people who feel that extending Heathrow is too much of a challenge.
As far as the Olympics are concerned, I heard that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will be in an awkward situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will also be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow will answer every question asked about it.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits many people instead of a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and to increase the economy by GBP 211 billion, bringing skills and employment to both the airport environment and the UK as a whole.
We have a great working group at Heathrow, which has implemented and maintained the 11 billion-pound infrastructure investment programme in the budget, which included the T5 terminal – which has been voted the best flight terminal of the year for two consecutive years – and the T2 terminal, which was built in the middle of the world's most congested runway.
Now they are ready to produce the third runway, supported by a private investment of £16 billion.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be an extension of Heathrow.
It is time we used the same Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow so that we can guarantee the future of our trade and create knowledge and employment from which Britain can be proud.
Lord Paul Deighton is the chairman of Heathrow's government and former trade secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook advertising in cat-mouse game
The efforts of companies that make money on online advertising have turned advertising into cat-mouse games, says one company that produces inhibition programmes.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced on its website that it was blocking advertisingtenesto programs, Adblock Plus published a blog article where it told us that users could update their blocking software filters and thus reinstate community service ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change the advertising codes of its desktop site, making it harder to identify which parts of the site are ads.
Now, however, Adblock tells us that he's cleared the new codes.
Adblock informant Ben Williams wrote in his blogger that "this kind of ball between the open source advertising community and the delusionalists has been in progress since the adstensor was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon make its own repair movement.
The fact that the largest social media company in the world has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of the concern expressed by advertisers in this field.
Globally, an estimated 200 million people are using adstensto programmes, reports the research carried out by Pagefair and Adobe last year. The figure has almost quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook uses 1.03 million active users every day on mobile devices, and mobile advertising already accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook's advertising revenues.
However, the company intends to invest in misleading advertising programmes in its desktop application, because according to the press, mobile advertising prevention programs do not work on Facebook mobile applications and Instagram.
The revenues from Desktop advertising are still sufficiently high, which is why Facebook considered it worthwhile to invest.
On Tuesday, Facebook also reported updating the user settings advertising tool to allow users to control more how ads are targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticises Adblock's new filters, as it also says that they prevent some of the ordinary Facebook emails from being visible.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem" said the Facebook informant in his e-mail release.
"The advertising prevention programmes are clumsy and inefficient, and that is why we have instead invested in the development of user settings such as advertising tools, so that people can control the targeting of advertising themselves."
A woman committed suicide by falling under the cars on the Swiss freeway.
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
The police are asking for witnesses on the freeway for the first hour of Thursday’s accident in which a woman deliberately fell under several cars.
The accident took place on the A1-motor road in the Vaud Canton near the Morges shortly after midnight.
The woman did her desperate act by laying on the dark road, and several cars hit her, says the Vaud police when they announced.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, and his aim was clearly to commit suicide. Among the overtime cars was also a truck.
She died at the scene.
According to the police, many of the drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some have not yet been identified, and the police are asking them or other witnesses of the accident to report.
Lawyer Gilles Hofster tells us in Le Tribune de Geneva that a criminal investigation has been launched, which is a logical step in a situation like this.
However, it remains to be seen whether the drivers involved in the accident will be prosecuted.
"Is it impossible to avoid a collision?
It's left to the D.A.'s office," says Hofster.
Over the last five years, two similar cases have occurred that are not considered responsible for drivers.
According to the newspaper, in both cases a person walked on a dark motorway and the court decided that drivers could not expect to run into a pedestrian on a freeway in the middle of the night.
Last year a police officer was released from the charge against him after he ran into a man who lay on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on one of the nights of August 2014.
The court heard that a 22-year-old victim had been drinking a lot of alcohol and passed out.
The Court found that the police – which was responding to an emergency call – were justified and that the man lying on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation".
Anyone aware of an accident near Morges on Thursday will be asked to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus has been viable
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus may have been viable.
NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model to explore Venus’s past with the same tools and algorithms as those used by climate scientists.
The purpose of the model was to determine whether the conditions in Venus were sometimes similar to those on the earth, even though Venus is hot and anhydrous and its atmosphere consists almost entirely of carbon dioxide.
According to the researchers' earlier performances, Venus's slow speed is explained by its thick gas ring.
However, on the basis of the latest simulation, Venus has had a thin atmosphere similar to the earth and has nevertheless been slowly rotated.
The model was also used to find out about the early Venus surface formation.
The planet was likely to have more dry areas than the Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographical variations to sustain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 per cent darker.
"In the GISS model, Venus spins slowly and has a day-to-day of nearly two months at a time," says Anthony Del Genio, a GISS researcher.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick cloud layer. The cloud layer acts like an umbrella and protects the surface in large parts of the sun's heat.
As a result, the average temperature of the climate is up to a few degrees lower than the current temperatures of the Earth.
The model was used to create Venus's story, which corresponds to the previous assumptions of planetary scientists regarding its development.
Although Venus may have been viable, for several billion years it has been exposed to excessive heat and UV light.
Its oceans vanished, and the UV light burned the steamed water.
As hydrogen ran into space, only a thick carbon - shaped gas ring and a deadly greenhouse effect remained — that is, Venus, as it is today.
Researchers reported the results of the new Venus air modeling in the Geographic Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is giving up his place as coach of Avalanche.
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and as Deputy Director-General for hockey activities of the club, calling for a lack of influence in the team's decision-making.
Colorado Vice President/Chairman Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the Society would immediately begin to seek a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have carried out my duties as head coach for Colorado Avalanche and as Deputy Director General of the hockey team," says Roy, 50-year-old in his communication.
" During the summer I have wondered long and hard about how I could improve the team, give it the necessary depth and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the Deputy Director-General of the training and association’s hockey activities must be in full line with the organisation.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are currently not met."
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me his decision today," says Sakic.
"We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him every good for the future."
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award award as the best coach in the league for his first season as head coach of Avalanche from 2013 to 2014.
Under his leadership, the club scored 112 points and won the middle division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and has not been able to reach the next two years.
Avalanche reached 39-39-4 power points in 2015–2016 and remained five points away from Minnesota Wild when playing from another Wild Card in the Western Conference.
The Hall of Fame painter Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career – two in Montreal Canadiens and two in Avalanche ranks.
The oil workers of the North Sea start negotiations and suspend the strike
The main negotiators report the interruption of the North Sea oil workers' wage laws when all parties to the dispute participate in a new round of negotiations.
The Wood Group, which provides oil-field services, has been attacked by drilling boxes under the control of Royal Dutch Shell in the North Sea.
According to the Joint Declaration of the Parties, "Wood Group and Trade Unions Unit and RMT confirm that they have agreed to reopen the process in order to resolve the dispute".
From the start of next week, we will hold a number of full-time meetings over the next few weeks, where we will discuss the problems of the fresh ones.
Trade unions justified their recent activity, which was the first over 25 years, as a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
Due to the negative market pressures, Wood Group will cut around 9% of the tariffs for its contractors in the North Sea this year.
The reduction in the company's tariffs is in line with a 10% reduction in the prices of contractors working in the countries in 20114.
According to the company, the additional cuts give it the space of movement necessary to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut down thousands of employees on its pay lists and has announced plans to leave oil and gas drilling activities in up to 10 countries, thereby making it more efficient after its megafusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Lower crude oil prices and the economic situation, as a result of the British decision to leave the European Union in June, put pressure on energy companies.
Mr Dave Anderson, a Scottish Member of Parliament, met with labour leaders earlier this week in order to discuss one of the biggest labour conflicts experienced in the North Sea for an entire generation.
According to him, the North Sea is vital for the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and the whole country, we need an economy that benefits many, and not only few," says Anderson.
Under $1.4 billion is expected to be used for new North Sea projects in 2016, when around $7 billion has been spent over the last five years.
Kepler measures the speed of star rotation in the plejad star range
The latest task of the Kepler Space Scenario has been to measure the speed of star rotation, which has helped the astronomers to compile the most comprehensive list of the speeds of stars in the Pléjad group so far.
On the basis of new information, astronomers are able to determine why the stars of the same group are spinning at different speeds and how the orbits are linked to the planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing the results with other constellations we will learn more about the relationship between weight and age, and even the history of its solar system," says Luisa Rebull, researcher of the Infrared Management and Analysis Centre of the University of Caltech in Pasadena, in the press release.
The plejad star force is located 445 light-years away from the earth.
Many starry groups were born some 125 million years ago, which means they are just reaching adulthood.
They're currently running faster than ever.
At the peak of the adult stars, the speed of rotation is falling out of large amounts of the constellation.
These winds have a braking effect on the stars as they progress through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star ages, its speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by monitoring the time between the appearance of identifiable star points (corresponding to the sun points).
The most recent listed speed data suggest that the larger stars will rotate more slowly than the smaller ones.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers – the larger spins more slowly than the smaller ones.
"We see from the "dance" of the Pleads that slow spins are typically larger, whereas the fastest spins are typically very light stars," Rebull says.
Since the plejads are so close, it acts as an ideal space laboratory to compare the characteristics of the stars with the speed of rotation.
"The Peljad Star Corps offers a support pillar for theoretical models on the rotation of both younger and older stars," Rebull says.
We want to learn a lot more about how, when and why the stars slow down their rotational speed and stop their "dance".
Rebull and his colleagues present their latest analysis of the speeds of the Pleidias in three new articles that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
