The Prague Stock Exchange was negative at the end of the trade
The Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses after the crash of the morning.
Transactions with the shares of the Czech Energy Industry Company (Čez) accounted for nearly half of the total daily trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange continued its fall on Monday immediately from the beginning of Tuesday’s trade, when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, Wall Street's stock falls behind the decline.
This is how the market reacts to the vote of the American House, which refused to support the stabilisation plan of the financial sector there.
Loss of shares in Asia
In the Asian stock exchange, the dramatic fall of the shares was experienced on Tuesday, although the figures during the day were finally eliminated.
The Hang Seng Stock Exchange Index in Hong Kong described almost four percent during the trading period, but later it removed some of the losses and reduced them to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell 3.8 percent, and markets were closed in Shanghai.
The shares in the Sydney stock exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually the losses fell to 4.3 percent.
According to the Taiwan Stock Exchange, there was 3.6 percent fall.
"The timing of the U.S. rescue operation is uncertain and affects the world's financial markets," noted Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Financial Council.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy independently, i.e. independently of the Central Bank of China.
In Hong Kong, interest rates are on the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the American legislators should renegotiate the negotiations immediately and accept the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will feel the consequences.
Bloodbath of American shares
The U.S. House rejected the draft financial system support on Monday, to which it should have spent 700 billion dollars (almost 12 billion kroons).
The legislators therefore ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the draft would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the economy as a whole.
On Monday, the American stock experienced a bloodbath and the leading stock indices recorded the biggest fall in 20 years.
The Dow Jones fell by almost seven percent, with a similar drop last time in 1987.
The index fell before the vote, but as it turned out that the proposal was not accepted in the House, the index began to fall free.
Congress resigned: The US government could pump $700 billion into the banks
The main leaders of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of agreement and financial assistance to the American financial system.
They will vote on this at the beginning of next week.
The U.S. legislators have experienced a breakthrough in the negotiations on the rescue plan in the form of financial assistance to the U.S. financial system worth 700 billion dollars (about 12 trillion kroons).
But there's no victory yet.
The convention must complete some of the details of the agreement before being able to publish the final form of the law and their votes.
The draft financial system support will be discussed at the Assembly on Monday.
On Sunday, the Reuters News Agency was informed by Barney Frank, Chairman of the Committee of Financial Organisations.
According to Senate resources, the draft will probably be voted on as soon as possible on Wednesday.
According to economists, there should be an announcement that the rescue plan will be approved, the first important psychological factor in restoring the financial markets.
However, due to the complexity of the mechanisms, there will then be "depreciation".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We've taken a big step.
We have resolved our views on what the form of the market stabilisation package should be," said the Bloomberg agency, Democrat Nancy Pelosi.
He said that the final vote could take place on Sunday.
On Saturday night, representatives of lawmakers met Henry Paulson, the US Minister of Finance, to give a final form to the government fund.
This should be to buy from financial companies unsold mortgage assets that put financial companies into serious losses and jeopardise the stability of the whole system.
"We are in the process of a final agreement on a draft that will work and which must also be effective on the market.
The repair project still needs to be continued, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
Marking asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Democratic Senator Harry Reid, the legislators are therefore seeking to reach an agreement in Congress on Sundays.
In this way, they want to reassure investors before they start trading in Asian money markets, where Congress's decision to trade on Monday would be the first to be affected by the time zone.
For the time being, however, it is not clear when the two chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, as is the case, whether the trial should be held at the last minute because of a problem.
The legislators hope that the law will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law goes through many changes.
The total amount to be used to support the system shall be divided into two parts.
According to President Bush's request, the first USD 350 billion should be available as soon as possible.
However, the Congress may block the issue of the remaining amount, which was set at another USD 100 billion and later USD 350 billion, if it feels that the programme is not performing its function.
Bush assessed progress in the negotiations
Although the President may veto this decision, Congress may override its veto.
However, despite these changes, the main idea of the programme was the acquisition of financial instruments for the purchase of impaired mortgage securities, since hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay their mortgage loans.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The progress made in the negotiations is also satisfied with the American President Bush.
Tony Fratto, spokesperson of Bush, said that the President was satisfied with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated the two-party effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy.
Limitation of bus termination allowances
Christopher Dodd, President of the Senate Banking Committee, who led the negotiations, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility for the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers against losses, the closure of discounts and the timing of the draft funding.
The new law also restricts the so-called bus terminals of the directors involved in the programme and establishes a fund monitoring committee.
The fund should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We've worked very hard on this, and we've made a great deal of progress towards an agreement that will work and which will be useful for every American," Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance to houseowners who have problems with the payment.
Government loans purchased by the government should start with new repayment shares, with a view to reducing the monthly repayments of debtors and enabling them to keep their homes.
Marek: Spiritual Aid
David Marek, the leading economist of Patria Finance, said that the proposed proposal is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
"It's all because there's no way to know what kind of mechanism or price the problematic active substances are going to be bought.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government divide losses among themselves," said Marek to the iHNed.cz site this week.
According to Marek, it is not so important that the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week.
"It's more important that the convention decides this week that the plan will be supported, and as soon as possible they will be blessed.
The spiritual importance of reaching an agreement on the adoption of the plan is the most important thing at this moment," Marek emphasised.
Couple of blades: MP3 players versus mobiles.
We help you choose
While almost all mobiles can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can play.
It seems clear that it's better to just buy a phone.
Nevertheless, there are many reasons why you can get a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on how it is used and on the needs of the prospective owner.
It's probably hard to get home a high-quality expensive record player to listen to that latest Maxim Turbulenc record.
On the one hand, such music products do not appear on the baseball discs, but there is no objective reason for this from a quality point of view.
However, if the shelf is full of art rock, jazz or blues Bacelite discs, it is likely to dream of such a record player.
This is similar to that for the journey, i.e. compressed - simplified with MP3 music.
There are also price and quality categories.
Some people may not be able to issue 8,000 kroons for a player, as a Pink Floyd fan probably has difficulty accepting a 20-coron market earphone.
Two extremities, where everyone has plenty of room.
There's a wide choice.
The life expectancy of the elements is also relevant
Some high-quality music players can do much more than simply play music, but also what most of the mobiles do not by chance.
No device is as universal as the phone.
Besides the primary features, calling and texting, you can also play music and video, record both, have a better or worse camera, even navigation.
And if you consider smartphones and communicators, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a miracle, because there's no fridge that can grill and no TV can take pictures.
Several mobile functions have disadvantages, however.
The more functions you use on your mobile, the more the display sends it to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few mobile devices can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, mostly less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
For this reason, count on cheap cell phones that they won't be playing for you for more than a few hours.
If you even call here and there, get even a charger for safety at work - this also applies to more expensive devices.
MP3 players will not have such a problem, even worse ones can withstand a continuous operation of at least 9 hours with a charge.
The next problem arises when you upload music to your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices have a universal USB connector and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without any special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few card readers can cope with the miniature memory cards used in mobiles without an adapter.
You don't need any special software for players with some exceptions (iPod).
Enough to download the device from your computer with music via USB.
The majority of mobiles and players are already creating a music library that is ranked on the basis of the artist's own name, album, genre's name, or user's evaluation.
Some devices are just like Windows Explorer, and you know both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to handle, mobiles know more
The choice of the specific equipment should include the battery life, memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of treatment.
If the music serves you primarily as a background and listens only for a short period of time per day, for example on the electricity, any mobile playing MP3 will suit you.
And any cell phone can do that.
You don't have to pay particular attention to the music formats of your mobile or player.
The MP3 will all be able to handle it and the vast majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
MP3 is among the most widespread, and the vast majority of devices are also able to handle WMA-shaped music.
AAC (the format used by Apple and iPod) is less common.
Better mobiles also allow for online music purchases, for example.
Enough to visit the appropriate sites of the service provider (or other service providers) through the mobile internet and purchase the song or album.
This service can itself be a strong argument for the purchase of music mobiles.
Unfortunately, the supply of service providers is limited to lame and generally limited to a very large number of radio hits.
Prices are not the lowest.
In general, however, it is assumed that music will dominate the music industry in the future, whether through GSM, Internet or wireless internet.
Most people keep their mobile devices on their own all the time.
Any time you want to listen to something, you can tap your cell phone out of your pocket while the forgotten MP3 player is at home.
However, it still depends on whether he always carries earphones or at least speakers.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker with almost all mobile phones, but only a few MP3 players.
For many, music mobiles will probably have the greatest advantage of the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3,000 crowns.
You can get enough decent walkman between three and four thousand crowns.
However, you are mostly limited by the lack of conventional earphone output.
The best and most technically equipped telephones with traditional earphones with a diameter of 3,5 mm can reach up to 15,000 crowns.
At the same time, the advantage of players is simple manageability.
The simplest - certainly not necessarily by treating the cheapest players (see our selection) is indeed dealt with by everyone.
Minimum function, treatmentability comparable to the previous usual cassette tape or gramophone is obvious.
There is no risk of collapse in the form of an accidentally switched-on mobile internet, nor of a huge account for data transmission.
Which device to choose
The cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have openings for interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
You can also buy the right card into maximum two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The basic types only support cards with maximum capacity of up to 2GB.
Only the most expensive can do with up to 8 GB of memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and even want to buy cheap MP3 players, choose Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton, or Irivert.
Based on the capacity (max. 2 GB) it does not have to spend more than 1 100 kroons.
If you belong to more demanding students, choose special mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices also have a separate MP3 control button, and the convenience of the treatment approaches MP3 player.
In the sector, Sony Ericsson was the largest player, which has the same user interface as the MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 players of the above mentioned brands can provide the same service in the same price category up to four thousand kroons but with higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider will be arriving in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The Czech mobile market is relatively developed and our service providers provide the same services as their Western European partners.
Nevertheless, there is something missing here - a virtual service provider that forces classic service providers to reduce their prices significantly.
Maybe it won't be for long.
On the Mobil.cz website, we have often written that Czech service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This has been confirmed by the ČTÜ, which has pointed out that the price of the text in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in the rest of the Union.
Following the last step of the European Commission, the regulation of roaming charges may lead to a conflicting situation - messages from some Czech mobile operators from abroad will be cheaper than from the domestics.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that really wants to fight.
This may sound controversial, since we also have three mobile networks and our penetration is well above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators are happy to complain that the Czech market is highly competitive.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office, Pavel Dvołák, who has said several times before that there is no room for another service provider in the Czech Republic.
It may be true that the classic service provider may no longer have too much chance with its own network (although it would probably be difficult to find a frequency anymore).
But there is another option - the virtual service provider.
It was precisely the introduction of virtual service providers on the mobile market that led to a significant reduction in prices, which would then have to be addressed by the classic service providers.
In the meantime, even before the launch of large fish, such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile in Great Britain, we heard sounds similar to ours.
However, it has been demonstrated that such service providers have a place and can indeed be successful.
However, we do not have to go too far for an example.
In February this year, we informed you of the start-up of the Mobiling virtual service provider in Poland.
This service provider has not been able to obtain more than 100 000 customers in six months and become the fifth largest service provider there.
Meanwhile, behind the Mobilking is the Penta Financial Group, which is also owned by U:phone in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual service providers is the possibility of focusing on a much narrower target group.
In order to operate effectively, it requires far fewer customers than the traditional service provider.
It does not involve relatively high construction, mobile network operation and maintenance costs.
Virtual service providers in the world generally appear at low cost - offer cheap calls and text messages, which are often counterbalanced by less services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Britain offers texting at least 50 percent cheaper than its competitors.
But as the example of Mobiling in Poland shows, it can be a pretty good move for a target group.
This service provider focuses specifically on men.
"The real men choose the Mobiling Service provider - who they like to trust," says David Seibert, CEO of the Mobil Entertainment Company operating this virtual service provider.
It is difficult to say whether a vision similar to that of Poland can work with us.
Miroslav Čepický, spokesperson of Vodafone, questions: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which the majority of virtual service providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively satisfactory from the point of view of the provision of services."
In the Czech Republic, there is no chance that mobile operators will be able to do so.
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual service provider in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobiling.
"We are talking about a successful expansion of this project, but in the Czech Republic, the negotiations do not seem very hopeful.
The launch of Mobilking takes place in other countries of our region," said Jana Studničková, spokesperson of the Penta Financial Group in her phone interview with Mobilcz.
This indirectly demonstrated that existing Czech mobile operators are not too much into this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do their utmost to ensure that no potential competition exists.
The GTS Nowera Group has not long been hiding its interest in the launch of a virtual service provider, which therefore wishes to take another step to make Telenica O2 a real competitor in the field of corporate customers.
"We are very interested in providing not only landline but also mobile telecommunications services to our customers.
And the sooner the better.
We have discussed this possibility repeatedly with all Czech mobile operators.
Some of them have already made progress in the negotiations," says Pavel Kaidl, the Group spokesperson.
Maybe this is a better time.
Unofficial information suggests that the first virtual service provider will be lucky by the end of the year.
However, his birth is surrounded by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"In this moment, we do not think that a full-value virtual service provider would have a place on the Czech market.
Contrary to the other markets, the Czech market is very special.
Until now, we have not been invited by a single subject offering a complex and serious project in this area," said Vlastimil Sršeň from Telefónica 02 Press Department.
The special situation of the Czech market is also referred to by the other operators.
Ms Kemrová, spokesperson of T-Mobile, with the exception of O2, adds: "We have not yet recorded any viable and bilateral business projects that could be based on further."
And he added, "On the T-Mobile network by the end of the year, it is unlikely that any virtual service provider will show up.
At this moment, there should be a specific agreement on our table so that we can think in such a short space of time."
Vodafone’s attention is rather directed towards meeting its 3G licence requirements.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual service providers, particularly in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure sharing.
This is what we consider to be the most cost-effective for our customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to partner in building networks shared with the fast mobile internet."
Responsible offices - a string with service providers
Mobile service providers' procedures are easy to understand, and the entry of a new service provider would lead to an increase in competition, a reduction in prices and a decrease in their profits.
So why make it easier for us to enter such a competition?
When it is important for service providers, they can cooperate, and they can also witness the string of U-phones around the birth.
The highest pressure on ČTÜ is likely to be around the birth of the U-phone of T-Mobile.
This is confirmed by the information publicly available from the website of ČTU.
But right now, the U:phone comes with a good argument as to why we should not allow the entry of the virtual service provider.
Martina Kemrová added: "The environment of competition in the mobile market has recently been affected by access to the fourth mobile market.
In view of the nature of the Czech mobile market, it is evident that the entry of another player into the market and its services would be subject to high requirements."
However, given the attitude of mobile operators, the total lack of interest of the Czech regulatory authorities is absolutely amazing.
In the meantime, it is not just the attitude of the ČTU, which unfortunately, in the Czech Republic - unlike Great Britain and other developed countries - has no right to intervene in economic competition.
Only the Office of Competition is entitled to do so.
But the office is typical of the whole problem.
"The entry into the mobile market of a virtual service provider would only be possible after the conclusion of a contract between a mobile service provider and a virtual service provider for the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, since the offer of potential interested parties is unlikely to have been sufficiently interesting for traditional service providers," she mentioned, in response to our question about Kristian Chlapua, the external relations department of the Competition Office.
A declaration thus formulated by the representatives of the service providers would probably not surprise anyone.
However, from an office that should represent the interests of consumers and also ensure that no one is allowed to take advantage of their market situation, it is more than strange.
In particular, when Kristian Chalua adds: "In a foreign country, where virtual service providers generally operate, we can observe that their entry has contributed to the reduction in the price of mobile phone services."
However, it is unlikely that UOHS’ interests do not fall within the scope of the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and on price reductions.
In this case, it is indeed shocking that the reaction of the three mobile operators is quite tangible.
The question is, is it really just a coincidence? It's almost self-evident.
As in the filling stations, totally identical gas prices are probably only works of chance and hard competition.
"The Office did not discover the signs of the anti-competitive procedure in this case, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the service providers have a leading position, i.e. a proportionately higher responsibility for their market realities.
The tools needed to open up the mobile market for virtual service providers are likely to be lacking by the telecommunications regulator," Chalua mentioned.
Presentation of the market-leading situation is one of several points of dispute.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTÚ, which means that telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, there is, of course, no Czech service provider in the leading position.
However, some legal experts also offer a different approach - the approval of the network operator is always necessary for the creation of a virtual service provider.
And the mobile service provider - relatively logically - has a monopoly on its own network.
So it is necessarily dominant in a particular segment.
But even if we do not accept this argument, it should be a minimum incentive for UOHS to act in a similar way to three mobile operators.
In the meantime, complaints from interested parties (including the already mentioned GTS Nevera company) show that they face very similar obstacles during negotiations with all service providers.
And shifting responsibility to ČTú is a relatively common trick in telecommunications, with which UOHS takes its hands off the whole case.
We've met with this in a few similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the recently adopted Telecommunications Act, the extension of the powers of ČTU in the field of economic competition has not been possible in telecommunications, although many experts have hoped to improve the situation.
The representatives of the U.S.S.S. must know this well, but probably others are in their interests.
This works when no one's watching
Meanwhile, the operation of some kind of fake virtual service provider remains unnoticed, many of which are already operating in Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that issue their own mobile service price lists, but which are only partially public.
It is multilevel marketing companies.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only the selected ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts as a classic customer against the provider, which orders a large amount of SIM card.
As a priority client, you will then receive special offers (and other discounts).
The problem is that all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar promotions from trading conditions.
"If there were cases that he was talking about, there could be a breach of the contractual terms that we would deal with and which could lead to the completion of cooperation with the company," Martina Kemrová replied to our question about this problem.
But it is unlikely that news about such activities would not have reached the responsible people of mobile operators.
In particular, thousands of customers may be mentioned for the three companies mentioned.
At the same time, no service provider protects against such a procedure.
Because they do not have negligible profits from the activities of these companies and, unlike real virtual service providers, they do not in particular threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns of possible problems: "The law allows similar speculations, however, only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They must also accept that the SIM card is not on their phone, so they cannot fully have it as the general customers of mobile operators."
But at least that's what the C.T.U. should be weird about.
In addition, another question arises for UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes on similar procedures, why prevent the birth of a virtual service provider?
It should be added that UOHS has relatively strong powers to expose such activities and that, if it does not, it does not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the service providers that they have not provided any such evidence and that their trading conditions prohibit it.
When we won't be the most expensive
As has already been said in the text a few times, the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market has led to a noticeable fall in the price of services.
In the meantime, in virtually all countries where virtual service providers were established, classic service providers sought to prevent their creation more or less.
The arguments they used were practically the same - too small, perhaps too satisfied, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, in the developed countries, it was at these moments that regulators intervened, which in no way protected the interests of mobile operators but their customers.
Then it was either through formal measures or informal pressure that the first virtual service provider that was followed by others was created.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are giving the whole case to each other.
Based on our experience, we cannot rid ourselves of the impression that unclear competences are good for them in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider is indeed coming out soon, the Czech mobile market may re-launch.
If one of the providers allowed the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, it is difficult for UOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of additional interested parties.
And perhaps we will no longer make more expensive calls compared to the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Select the Best
Listen to the four processings of the new Czech state hymn.
Sunday Prime Minister Mirek Topolák solemnly presented the new recordings of the state hymn of my country on the day of the Czech State.
The hymnust was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the leadership of Jiří Bělohlavs.
There are four versions available - male or female solos, chants or instrumentally.
They're singing by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the amendments to the hymnus are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on the iHNed.cz website.
Bålohlavs consider the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
He has already told the Czech Radio that he has deliberately chosen young performers with a representative voice to sing the solo variations, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried to look after both of them, and later at the orchestra I tried to ensure a clean distribution, a good understanding of the text and consistency," he said.
The Czech state hymn celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where I Have a Country? was first played in the Rent Theatre in 1834 by Josef Kajetan Tyl Fidlovačka, in addition to the music of František Škroup.
It became popular, and people looked spontaneously at it as their own.
The first verse of the song became a natural part of the state hymn after Czechoslovakia was founded in 1918.
Even after the creation of the autonomous Czech Republic, one of the seven national symbols remained.
What a "new" hymn
For the first time on Wednesday, Prague transport company also delivers chips card
On Wednesday, 1 October 2008, she writes herself in the history of the Prague Transport Company, when the first passenger enters metros, trams and buses, who will have an electronic coupon in his pocket instead of a paper ticket.
The coupon is currently available for about 100,000 people with the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day and 90-day and annual coupon (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and save on their chip card at the information centers and offices of the Transport Company at Muzeum, M'stek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stations.
Coupons can also be purchased via the Internet via the Transport Company www.dpp.cz website from yesterday.
The service was used by more than 400 customers until afternoon hours.
Those who start to use online commerce can permanently forget the station publishing windows, where they have had to make long lines on a regular basis.
The coupon can be purchased via the Internet and placed on the Opencard card in one of the thirteen accounts of the City Library.
"In these places passengers have at their disposal a counter with trained servers, who help interested people buy online and save their purchased coupons on their cards," said Martin Opatrný, project spokesperson.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons will be saved on the Opencard in the self-service machines installed in some of the lobbys.
How do these machines look?
Red, the ticket operators are reminded, and the passengers may already have noticed them at Roztyly, Budějovicka, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"There are now five of them in the city, but it should be eighty by the end of the year," added Opatrný.
Check the coupon instead of the driver
It's easy to manage machines starting tomorrow.
All you have to do is put the Opencard chip card in and the coupon you've paid before will be gone on its own.
The electronic coupons will be valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in its vicinity.
So on trains and bus lines around the city from 300 to 499, with the main residents of the Central-Czech routes travelling to the capital.
"On the Prague integrated trains, the guide has been provided with card readers, which also help determine the validity of the coupons in the zone," explained the control of the line marks by Filip Drápal from the Ropid organization that established the Prague public transport schedule.
The busses around the city are equipped with card readers at the driver's register.
The driver must therefore not only show the chip card but also place the Opencard in the location specified on the cash register side.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the coupons.
"If, for example, the passenger needs to verify the validity of the coupons, it is easy to ask the driver to do so," added Drápal.
Passengers who don't use buses around the city and won't remember when their coupon expires can go again to self-service machines that save coupons.
The information on the validity of their documents is displayed here on the display of the equipment.
The Sudanese wanted a referendum from the U.S.
The Sudanese Germans asked for the United States to be joined in 1945.
This is found in the letter in the collection of the South Czech Scientific Library.
If we cannot be a part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the United States of America.
It has been said that this wish was turned to the President of the United States in 1945 by a few groups of Sudanese Germans.
This is also found in a private archive, which is stored today in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Czech Republic.
In the letter, the Germans in Česky Krumlov ask the American President not to allow the re-admission of the "Shumava county" to the Czech Republic, which Hitler has taken under the Munich Treaty.
"We understand the situation correctly, and we really want to be sure in the words that the American troops are definitely not coming to the German territories as a repressive and enemy, but as a liberator," in the letter, "embers who carry the fate of Shumava", signed in their hearts.
Since the addition of Sudan to Czechoslovakia is said to be Germans - with the knowledge of the Czech national character - only hope for brutality, ruthlessness, not understanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over Šumava 'now and forever'.
"We cannot believe that, despite the views of four million inhabitants, this area would be judged to be a foreign country for us, which suppresses and upsets the minority, and would do nothing to contribute to the victory of the allies," he says.
The reason the authors couldn't sign is because of the fear of the "Czech Repressors" desire for revenge.
Therefore, if the President of the United States were to doubt the opinion of the Germans in Zambia, it would be sufficient to give a referendum on whether their inhabitants would like to become part of the United States and whether they would like to live under the United States.
Although the text of the letter, along with current knowledge of the postwar history, may seem somewhat naive, some historians say that it adequately portrays the expectations of the Sudanese Germans at that time.
Even if the Czech Germans had to suspect that they would be displaced from the country, few of them recognised this possibility.
Some expected that the United States and Great Britain would agree on a form of autonomy for the Sudanese.
Others were once again confident that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalua, an Austrian journalist born in České Budějovic.
Chalupa served in the Baltic Sea as German during the war.
When, at the end of the war, the British captured him and put him in the Holštynsk prison camp, several dozen other Czechs came to teach them in Czech.
"They were confident that when they returned home, the Czech language would be good for them," Chalua said.
According to him, none of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war counted that the Beneš decrees were deported from the country.
You're not thinking - you're paying!
Emotional campaign against leaders
The most expensive thing in Czech history is road safety.
The media campaign affecting emotions, which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday, could be described.
The Minister of Aleš ←ebíček's office hopes to deter leaders from dangerous behaviour behind the government.
The 150 million campaign will be featured on television, radio, cinema, internet, as well as flyers.
Drivers should be alerted to speeding and alcohol.
And you should also remind them to tap their seatbelts before they leave.
In particular, young drivers, motorcycles, pedestrians, and not least professional drivers want to talk to their consciences.
What's in the ads?
Emotional stories, mostly human stories.
This is also confirmed by the "bloodless" slogan of the whole campaign:
You're not thinking - you're paying!
"You don't think" is written in capital letters on the license plate.
And there's the word "paid" in the blood pool.
This should mean that a person can pay his life for a moment's carelessness.
The viewers are "horrified" by the advertising spots until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the English-Saxon countries, where dramatic images of the victims of accidents can be seen regularly.
They hope that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on the Czech roads.
The advertising spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Pull it, hit the drivers.
"The driver's system of pull, pull" is valid.
'Let them go' is when, for example, they go through red, saving time.
"Drink it" is the risk of punishment or accident.
The driver should be reminded of the risk," says Martin Kořa, the transport psychologist at the Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why the information campaign in the press, especially the negative campaign, is considered by the psychologist.
He thinks that the driver's attention is less effective than those calling for danger.
"If a hazard warning table is fitted, it is likely that the environment will soon be blended with the environment and the leaders will not deal with it," warned Kořán.
Because almost all the occupied areas would be returned in exchange for peace
Ehud Olmer, President of the Interim Israeli Government, spoke of the return of practically all areas occupied in 1967, i.e. the western coast of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan River, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He said this in an interview that was published on Monday by Jediot Achronot daily.
"We need to agree with the Palestinians, which means that almost all if we don't have to give all the areas back," Olmer told the daily newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we have to pass on a similar percentage of Palestinian territories, because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that any surrender includes East Jerusalem.
"He who wants safety in Jerusalem and, first and foremost, wants tractors and bulldozers not to cross his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, must give up part of Jerusalem," said Olmert referring to two city attacks in July, during which some people were killed and a few dozen were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a special solution for sacred and historical places in Old Town.
"He who wishes to preserve the sovereignty of Israel over the entire city must integrate 270 000 Arabs.
This is not going to work," he stressed.
Out of Golan
He also gave an opinion on the withdrawal of the Israelis from the Golan River, which he felt was an indispensable condition for the peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require a certain effort from Damascus.
"I do not recommend peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they have to give up so they can get Golan.
They must give up their current relationship with Iran; they must give up their relationship with Hezbollahhal (Switzerland Movement); they must give up their regular support for the terrorism of Hamas (Switzerland Movement), Al-Qaida and Jihad (Switzerland War) in Iraq," said the Prime Minister.
Questions after an accident: Is passenger escorts illegal in buses?
The law doesn't know them. It's not allowed to walk in a distance bus.
As regards the tragic accident of the Student Agency, near the Italian Padova, the question arises whether passengers and passengers can travel in the bus during the journey.
"If we want to comply strictly and formally with the law, the activities of the cabin crew are in contradiction with the legislation on transport activities," says Karel Hanzelka, spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport.
Last week, the death of a twenty - two - year - old passenger was probably caused by a truck driver crossing the bus.
The girl was sitting next to the driver at that moment, in the bus's least safe place, even though there were two more seats reserved for her.
The bus may crash or suddenly brake at the same time as the passenger coffee is served or offers a newspaper.
It has a role to play in whether the bus has its registered office.
If the bus is not homologised, the passengers must be seated.
The Student Agency has no seats at all; it is also confirmed by Radim Jančura, Director of the Company, Aktuálně.cz.
"We tried to find a solution with this Ministry, and at first the passengers were not allowed to move.
However, this has been withdrawn and we have found that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey if they have their own meeting," he said.
Law doesn't know the passenger guide
"There is no clear legal ban on the role of cabin crew - no legislation governing this position.
However, no legislation prohibits the provision of services to the carrier.
The Road Traffic Act knows only the concept of a vehicle attendant; its rights and obligations are not defined," says Hanselka spokesperson less clearly.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorný, Director of the Road Transport Department, believes that the law manages the problem properly.
"It depends on whether or not the bus's driver's license includes a seat.
And it's over," he says.
Buses can be divided into urban areas where there are seats and restricted maximum speeds, and seats between cities and allowed higher speeds, and distances without standings and allowed maximum speeds, seats with safety belts.
As on the plane, the expert says
Jaroslav Hořín, BESIP Transport Safety Expert, sees no fundamental problem on board passengers.
"With continued progress, there is not much danger, so we can compare the situation to the service on the plane.
I'm not even sure when there's a instability and the cabin attendant can hit his head."
"However, if the bus were suddenly stopped, its physical laws of course would apply.
Same as city buses or trams.
Passenger safety must be solved by the carrier by internal rules," he said, and he also believes that the problem has not been resolved from the point of view of law.
Jančura is ready to terminate services
The Student Agency offers passenger services as the only bus carrier.
He's got 200 cabin crew members.
The director doesn't consider their profession to be risky after the accident.
"As I have the impression, however, that the occupation of cabin crews is risky, I shall also cease.
Coffee and newspapers can be obtained by passengers on boarding.
That would be cost savings," he says.
For safety reasons, Alexej Litvin, the director of the Asiana, was responsible for operating a fraction of the flights compared to the Student Agency.
"We don't have passengers, we're against that from the beginning.
Sooner or later, it ends with some kind of fatal injury," he said to Týden.cz just a year ago.
It's been an incredible tragedy.
The company was killed by a young passenger in Plzeň, who worked for two years in Naples on a regular flight.
The Slovenian truck probably rolled out of the lane without using a direction indicator and stopped the bus.
All of a sudden, the driver of the bus was trying to get out with a manoeuvring, but the right front of the bus hit.
The sale by Jančura of two reserved places for the rest of the cabin crew is rejected.
"These places can't be booked, blocked at long distances."
The company wants to sue the head of the truck.
By indemnifying the girl's family, the Agency does not expect the court to rule, but it also expects financial compensation from the offender.
A change of law?
In the distant future
The clarification of the movement of passengers on board the bus could be the amendment of the law, which has been working for more than a year by the Department of Transport's 30th expert group.
"However, the group has not achieved any concrete results.
Buses are not so much more concerned with the maximum speed allowed on the motorway and mobile use during driving," says Hořín, expert.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of passengers to be a fundamental threat to passenger safety," Hanzelka, spokesperson, concludes that the control of the safety of buses falls within the competence of the police and labour offices.
Dysseldorf hopes pass Frankfurt
The letter from the WestLB Board to the staff of the Bank does not narrow itself.
The merger of the financial institution in Dysseldorf and the Deka-bank in Frankfurt would create "the central capital market organisation of the savings fund group", says the letter published on Monday.
WestLB would bring a long-term profitable "competition block" into a business like this.
Such a relationship could give a decisive boost to further mergers in the Land banking sector.
This is the reading of when a board in difficult times wants to prove its ability to act.
Because WestLB Bank, which is in a state of uncertainty, is still under huge pressure.
Not only is the EU Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, which recently informed the North Rhine-Vetphalia Province government that the deadline for finding a lasting solution is limited.
However, the subject of a kind of relationship between Deka-Bank and WestLB, a part of its investment funds, has long been known to savings fund clients.
At the end of August, Franz Was, the head of the Deka-bank, announced that the bank at Mainzer Landstraß and a province bank such as Helaba or WestLB did not see the point.
Nevertheless, the Board of Directors of Deka, which represents half of the Landesbanks and half of the savings fund associations, commissioned the Board to negotiate common business activities with WestLB.
This may involve capital market operations or certain parts of them.
However, negotiations - the financial circles that claim - have just begun.
Deka-Bank, one of the most important employers in the French financial sector, is not for the first time named in connection with the consolidation of the savings fund sector.
In 2003, the Deca-bank seemed to be joining Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba for a moment.
However, this third alliance has not become anything.
The plans have barely been made public, and the government of the province of Helaba has spoken against its interest in Helaba.
After that, the other two banks did not find each other.
Instead, Landesbank Rhineland-Pfalz was transferred to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg, Stuttgart.
However, the relationship between the Deka Bank and the Landesbanks has been re-encouraged.
Last time, however, Günther Merl, President of the Board of Directors of Helaba, spoke against the plans of mergers with his bank.
Nevertheless, the recognition of the need for convergence between the various banks in the middle sector is important.
Now, following the meetings in the Province of Bavaria, the relationship between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg is expected first.
That's not necessarily good news for Helaba.
If pressure on further fusions increases, potential partners may slowly run out for it.
In southern Germany, it could only be a younger business partner, even though the financial crisis has been going through significantly better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The merger with WestLB was ruled out by Giroverband Hessen-Thüring in Helaba at the beginning of the year.
The NordLB would be better off.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the artery.
On the other side, the question arises as to how the various business models of each bank fit together.
Merl stated in June that the German savings cash and capital union has not yet answered the crucial question of what business model the future of the Landesbanks should be guaranteed.
Finally, it is possible to cut up WestLB, which is obviously not desired there.
Thus, the letter of the Board of Directors there also states that they are certainly seeking a 'full solution'.
How this is compatible with the merger of individual units with Deca-bank is still the music of the future.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "Olas weekend"
This is the first time for Elena, the third or fourth time for Luca.
Now, however, Elena is here as her girlfriend, and so everything is quite different, says Luca.
Behind them, the Kaiser branded five - liter barrel consists of a strong-bore bearded man, explaining to some 200 persons who travel to Oktoberfest how deep they can draw voices out of their throats.
Elena's going to be looking at Luca's face first, then she's going to kiss him.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From the parking lot next to Puorta Nuova station, four buses depart at 23.45 with a destination "destinazione Monaco, painting della", expected arrival at 6.30 p.m.
Three buses are mainly for the Italians, and only Brazilians travel in the fourth.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans have already sang their flags, and during the night the celebration began.
And so loud that it's not for the Italians, Marco Guarda says.
The buses are owned by Marco, who wears long, artificial fur jackets and wide silver-edged glasses.
He's been traveling to Oktoberfest for five years. He's only arranged three trips this year.
At night, at the Oktoberfest during the day, at 22:30, home.
The accommodation would be unnecessary, Marco says.
The journey costs 75 euros, which includes welcome Kaiser beer cooked in accordance with the Bajoran Beer Act, accident insurance and German-language tours - Marco Frankfurt has completed a German course.
And they're already getting the buses into the night on the freeway towards Brennero.
No beer, not yet.
The bus will be quiet soon, the passengers will be asleep.
All right, they're gonna need their strength.
They are taking a break in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where several Italian buses on motorway 8 are taking a short break from Munich.
When Marco's group arrives in the parking lot near Theresienwiese at 6:30, as planned, there are nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco's holding another final briefing, introducing the war plan.
First, everyone wear the yellow cap.
On the left side, you can read the entry "Oktoberfest" written in fractur letters, next to Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiogiando.it".
Second, "When the gates of the brewery open, run", Marco cries into it in the morning.
"Foot!" take places in the back of the tent.
"Not forward, because we're stuck, and not all the yellow hats sit on the same bench, but spread out in the tent."
The one-liter receptacle costs 8.25 euros, and Marco screams.
And don't forget the tip.
"Show the security guards that you behaved well.
As soon as you leave your seats, they'll be taken."
Third, "You'll be back at 9:30 tonight."
And we're on our way to Wies.
On the way, one of the men, as a guide, binds yellow hats to trees, tablets, and even to the election poster of one of the great Bajoran peoples.
We need to prepare ourselves for retreat.
It's the second weekend of Oktoberfest, known as the Italian weekend.
There are no precise figures; there are 50,000 people who cross the Alps in the beer tents, said to be 10 percent of all the visitors of the weekend coming from Italy.
The Munich police are being strengthened by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers help the Bajoran Red Cross, which, in their national statistics, takes the first place with about 200 medical supplies, preventing the Austrians (about 80) and the subprime British (about 60).
The Italians especially liked the Hofbräu beer tent.
Unmoved nights for the creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, stressed by the Federal Minister of Finance of Peer Steinbrück only last week.
Even luckily, the politician used the word "relatively" and even added that the German banking sector is not spared by crisis-like developments.
Because this happened this weekend.
Daxon's listed Minchen Hypo Real Estate (HRE) has received a billion-dollar loan from the German banks' consortium to defend itself against market shocks.
A person who knows the situation told Reuters on Monday that credit subsidies are worth 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest after the part used.
The money is partly from private and partly public banks.
In the background, the Depfa subsidiary has losses.
According to a newspaper newspaper, Depfa is the manager of state funding, which has provided money for long-term projects and has been refinanced for a very short term - which is no longer possible because of the distrust on the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the Bank’s cash reserves decreased by 95 % to EUR 2,37 million and the equity ratio also fell moderately from 1.6 to 1.45 %.
Current revenues and net revenues from cash transactions decreased to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, revenue from credit claims and certain securities and from the liquidation of the target reserves of the credit business decreased by more than 70 % to EUR 5 million.
Only because of the higher revenues resulting from the reimbursement of the ex-post accounting costs of the conversion of the Depfa group, as well as the remuneration of interest under the Tax Regulation and the transactions carried out by the companies in the group, the income deficit of 16% was relatively moderate.
Following the privatisation in 1990, the former state finance company was first speculating corporate real estate loans, which were subsequently isolated at Aeral Bank.
Since classical state funding could provide little money, Depfa was more heavily involved in infrastructure projects as well as in private investors and public-partnership projects (PPP), and has expanded its activities internationally.
The value of the subsidiaries must now be described by Hypo Real Estate, which has a "essential effect" on the performance of the group - has been reported quite generally.
The fact is, no dividends have been paid.
The dividend was reduced to a third by 2007.
The Hypo Real Estate has become a major state and infrastructure manager since the receipt of Depfa.
It is more dependent on interbank market refinancing than on other financial institutions as it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of the US Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago, the inter-bank lending has ceased since the banks maintain their liquidity.
For Hypo Real Estate to refinance part of the Depfa loan portfolio, some EUR 50 billion, a short-term asset is needed annually.
According to the report by Hypo Real Estate, the group's financing needs are covered by the loan for a limited period of time and the company is protected "from the influence of the currently largely inoperable international financial markets."
According to other sources, refinancing is secured by the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, President of the HRE Board, said, however, that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use the financial markets for a reasonable period of time.
The Federal Bank of Germany and the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority (BaFin) consider that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate group is now ensured.
This gives the bank's shareholders and creditors hope.
But due to the dynamics and inestimability of the crisis, you cannot be certain.
It is not even inconceivable that funding does not have to be fully used.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the late-night news of Saturday, the bank was still on the verge of bankruptcy, even the equally temporary rescue of the rocks could not calm down.
The share price fell by 75 % to EUR 3,30.
On the other hand, bond exchange rates are pretty good.
While the first-class debt is barely changing, the exchange rates for the reversed bonds have fallen significantly.
In particular, the crisis concerns the previous subsidiary, Württemberg Hypo's bonds and, as far as possible, the maturity beyond 2009.
While the Hypo Real Estate bonds seemed to be an earlier speculative investment alternative, their value stability must now be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system due to the rise in the banking crisis and the fact that the financial institution almost brought the crisis to the house when it received Depfa.
As long as the central banks, governments and less vulnerable business banks are still ready to support the system, the reimbursement of benefits may start with due time.
Or what is happening is where almost no one is afraid to hope that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in the light of the reports on partial nationalisation, the likelihood of a certain border is now merely a legitimate hope.
For long-term creditors, it can cause sleepless nights to decide whether to avoid investment.
However, short-term investors may use the sale to constitute a reserve for taxes on the exchange gains of the coming years.
The secrets of Sylvana and the inside box
When the 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to introduce himself at Tachibana High School on the first day of teaching, the girls start whining: The German girl is totally "spray"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from the mangaes in the new exchange students blog about Japan.
"The first day of teaching in Japan.
I'm really excited.
I was on my way to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo, towards Kavansaki, and I travel 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my way alone, and luckily I wasn't lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not as serious as at home in Lower Saxony.
The students start calling at eight o'clock until they have a short conversation with the teacher at eight o'clock at 40 o'clock, the "home room."
But before the teaching began, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the type of person who likes to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I haven't had my school uniform yet, my housekeeper wore an old skirt with a shirt, blue knee and black leather shoes.
So I was standing in front of the cathedral in this dress, and I tried to put it all out right: "Salmonara, vo se Sylvana ..." - I'm Sylvana, I'm from Germany, and it's my birthday in a week's time.
At this moment, I was very happy to learn the language for two years.
All 31 girls whispered, whistled and waved, and I always heard the word "spray."
I've known that from my mangaes.
It belongs to the Japanese girls' basic vocabulary, and it means "beautiful, sweet."
Then I hit my spot quickly.
The girl sitting next to me smiled widely, felt it was an honor to have the exchange students planted.
The rest of the watch was quiet enough, but when the bell sounded, they rushed regularly.
Everyone talked and laughed, and with their questions they drilled a hole in my stomach - and it's quite difficult to understand the Japanese's English.
After the break, everyone packed out their insides.
My guest has made me a lunch like this - it's completely different from the boring German ten-hour sandwiches.
I got spiced rice, little sausages, a salad made of cucumbers and algae, fruit, and a kind of tofu baked meat.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat here in Japan.
Foods look strange, and they taste completely novel.
It's all very good, actually.
Well, yeah, maybe with the exception of the salty plums, Brrr!
In Japanese schools, the inside is not just lunch.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy her own handmade insider, which is especially artistic - in the hope that she can get to know the boy more closely during the lunch break.
I read about this in my manga comic books.
I wonder if I can observe this here.
"Why Japan?" - my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
'Cause you're just charming me.
After all, I've been reading mangaes for years.
And to better understand comic books and culture in them, I began to study Japanese once.
So it was absolutely clear to me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I'm attracted to tradition and customs.
And these people are very much credited here.
Japan, on the one hand, is the country of the latest techniques and trends - on the other hand, is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen in my life."
Rats have feelings, too.
You're a rat and you're runnin' off in a hell of a danger, does that mean you're feeling scared?
Joseph LeDoux, a neurologist, is convinced that the animals have feelings.
But how can you determine whether they feel the same way when they're acting like us?
For years, famous scientists have been publishing their articles in the "Edge" online magazine.
In one of the series SPIEGEL ONLINE, the question "What do you think is real, without being able to prove it?" is examined by the answer to the question.
I believe that animals have emotions and other state of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it so far. It is true that we cannot even prove that other people have a consciousness.
In this case, however, we can hope that all basic human brain configurations will be the same.
However, as we study other species, and as a general process of dissecting the issues of perception or general consciousness, we arrive in difficult walking areas, as the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals, pretending to be dead, running or attacking.
People behave in a similar way, some researchers conclude comparable subjective experiences.
But I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult for us to transfer our subjective experiences to the pets.
On the one hand, the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always contain the lateral frontal cortex (due to its role in short-term memory and implementation/control functions).
This wide area is more developed in humans than in other primates, and seems to be completely lacking in other organisms.
At least, in the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the pre-frontal cortex, for example, the consciousness of who we are or, in the case of design and decision-making ability, it is reasonable to assume that man is different from other primates.
An additional dramatic feature lies in the linguistic nature of man: Since a significant part of human experience is related to the language, it is often said to depend on it.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
However, even if the language is not dependent on the language, the language would certainly affect it, so the animal consciousness, whatever its nature, is likely to differ strongly from most of our state of consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to determine what kind of consciousness may be in the case of other animals.
If consciousness cannot be measured as an internal and subjective thing, and because of the special hardware it cannot be analyzed on the basis of our own experience, then his research will put us in serious trouble.
Most of my discussions relate to the content of conscious living, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is likely to be more accessible to science.
The animal consciousness processes could be examined without prejudice to the content, and this is exactly what happens in the case of experiments on short-term memory of primates, in particular in the case of visualisation.
However, in this assumption examined by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, they are more based on the nerve relationships of consciousness than on the indirect mechanisms: both can be the same or not.
Interestingly, this assumption stresses the importance of pre-frontal cortex in the development of visualization.
What is the result of this emotion?
I'm going to point out that an emotional system, like a fear, is activated in a brain that knows its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we are when the activity of a defence system that is localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) takes up a work memory.
In this way, emotions are closely related to the areas of the cortex that are characteristic of the primates and, in particular, of humans.
In addition to the language, perception is divided into fine degrees, because words and grammar enable us to distinguish and categorize situations, so that they can be described along with others.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio believes that emotions are derived from simpler activities of the brain cortex and the brain cortex's body sensitisation areas, as is Jaak Pankseep, who instead focuses on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed very much during human evolution, it can easily play a role in the overall emotion of species.
I don't know if I can deny that, but I think it's inconclusive.
Pancoseep believes that what appears to be a fear for rats and humans is likely to be felt in both cases: How can it be verified whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave alike?
A cockroach flees in the event of danger, does he feel fear?
In my opinion, just the same behavior is not yet evidence of the same experience.
Although neurocomparation continues to help: rats and humans have similar brain stems, cockroaches do not have any brains.
But the brain stem is responsible for emotions?
And even if this could prove it to people: how can we prove it to rats?
I think rats and other mammals, but maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have emotions.
However, I don't know how to prove this.
And since their emotions are likely to be fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and languages), I'm looking for the emotional behaviour of rats rather than emotional emotions.
In any case, progress in this area is noted at the neurological level when measured in rats and humans.
As for rats, I don't study language and consciousness, neither do I know emotions, because I don't know if they exist.
It may seem like someone else's short-sighted attitude, but I'd rather go forward than keep falling into a wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
Platini, President of UEFA: Grace period for Poland and Ukraine
The Ukrainian Prime Minister, Mr Vasjunik, said that the preparations would shortly fall under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees confidence in Ukraine in UEFA's Bordeaux decision and the evidence that they believe that Ukraine can jointly organise the European Championship with Poland," said Vasjunik.
"This, however, does not mean amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much to be done in both countries."
With regard to the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, both hosting countries are missing.
It is possible that the number of EB stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We have to work hard right now," said Grigori Surkis, President of the Ukrainian Labbing Association.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us."
In Poland, they wanted to take even more radical steps.
Following a number of scandals, the National Olympic Committee suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN, replaced by independent supervisor Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the initiative of Minister for Sport of Miroslaw Drzewieck.
There is a "serious risk that PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules", Drzewiecki said to the Polish PAP News Agency.
"We have assured Michel Platinum, President of the UEFA, that this will not adversely affect the preparation of the EIB in 2012.
Only in the last year had to be classified in the lower class because of manipulation, and eventually the league had to be postponed.
The deranged Dennis Quaid will fight back
The actress wanted to promote a new movie, she talked about her personal life in the interview, and now she's had a problem with her ex-husband, and Ryan, a Hollywood star, classified her ex-husband Dennis Quaide as a divorceist.
The one who's moaning - and beats back
The late rose war at Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid's ex-wife: The two Hollywood actors fought an ugly fight with each other seven years after their divorce - in front of the public.
And Ryan, in an interview with the American InStyle magazine, spoke for the first time last week about the reasons for the divorce: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, causing me a lot of pain."
And only after the divorce did Dennis find out how many women he cheated on him.
The spiritual striptease was due to the press work on Ryan's new "Women" movie, which tells us about the history of a adultery.
Dennis Quaid has definitely reacted to calling out to an unfaithful husband: "Nordic" - the 54-year-old actor said to the newspaper "New York Daily News", "And boring to repeat and spend our relationship."
In addition, it is "sorry" that 16-year-old common boys, Jack, are repeatedly reminded of the many pains and changes caused by divorce to a child."
While Ryan's been living alone since his divorce, Quaid got married again and recently became the father of a twin couple.
Therefore, his answer ends with the following side-section: "My life will continue anyway.
I am happy to know that I have a wonderful family in which everything is in order."
Flights and hotel room prices are falling
In the first half of 2008 European flights and accommodation were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a current study, air travel in Germany has become less than 50 percent cheaper.
The prices of air travel and hotel rooms have become more favourable again, thus summing up the results of one of the studies of American Express travel and financial service providers.
The company analysed its first half of 2008 booking data and found a significant price fall in the second quarter after the first quarter price increase.
After price rises in the hotel market for years, accommodation in many places has become cheaper.
Between January and March, prices increased on average by 6.9 per cent in 41 of the 48 European cities examined compared to 2007.
However, for the period from April to June prices were already 3.6 percentage points lower than in the previous year.
This trend was most clearly shown in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30-37 percent less than a year earlier.
The American Express sees the reason for this at a low dollar rate, which led to "the lush travel of American tourists".
The fall in hotel room prices affects financial centres, such as Frankfurt or London, rather than industrial cities such as Hanovert, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, the 26.3% increase in hotel prices is a European record.
As regards air fares, an increasing trend has also been seen in the first quarter.
Due to the increase in kerosene, passengers in the tourist class had to pay more in average 7.1 percent than in 2007, and long-term air travels with high fuel demand cost 29.2%.
Between April and June, the prices of tourist class flights decreased on average by 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, but in business and first class, prices showed only a much more moderate change.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices increased by 11.9 per cent and in the second quarter by 23.6 per cent.
According to the study, domestic flights in Germany decreased by half.
The reason for the fall in prices lies, on the one hand, in a moderate economic growth - the company claims.
In many segments of the aviation market, demand has weakened.
On the other hand, as a result of the Open Skies agreement which liberalises air travel between the US and Europe, the competitive pressure will increase.
The tense situation is confirmed by the fact that airlines are cancelling their loss-making operations and many airlines reported bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe this concerns 24 airlines.
The Gladbach is bleeding to 1:0 HSV
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV was placed at the top of the table.
At Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to find the working team.
Kristoffer Klein magnification Deep Fly for the national selected Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player was only late in the game, and the raise was back from the gate tree.
The exact message you've formulated has been convincingly left her lips.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," she said Hermann Rieger in the corridor leading to the arenas in Hamburg.
There's not much going on in the catacombs, the break's over, and most of them are back in place.
Rieger was a physical therapist of the HSV for nearly three decades, enjoying greater authority than some players.
So his request was heard in the competent place.
Auxiliary coach Cornelius Jol nodded and agreed to show his thumb.
Cornelius is Martin Jol's brother, the head coach in Hamburg.
His orders must have said the same thing to the second goal.
The implementation of the order has not been completed.
"Today was not always a beautiful sight" - admitted later Marcel Jansen.
Bastian Reinhardt's "beautiful" idea.
1:0 (1:0) owes fresh results to Mladen Petric’s head of Hamburg (11); and the fact that the very weak Gladbachi were unable to cause pain to the weak hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," he booked Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV will be 121 this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the viewers celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena, and the table on the projector, which marked their team as the first class of the championship.
It's gonna be a birthday without a party.
"We know where to put this" said Marcel Jansen.
He believes that the interim certificate of the table is more of an unpredictable nature of the league than the domination of the HSV.
Although the team has been late committed - thanks to the Brazilian Names and Silva, Captain Petric and Jansen from FC Bayern - it is slowly finding itself, but it has not yet been grilled.
"We need more sense and action," Jol insisted.
After the shooting
Wall Street is surrounded by fear.
As a result of the first news of the failure of the rescue package, Dow Jones temporarily dropped 700 points.
This was the biggest score loss in his history within one day.
Later, Dow got a little stronger.
At 20:30, the world's most important barometer on the stock exchange was well down 5 percent and was down 10.579 points.
Nasdaq, a technology salesman, fell to 1548 points with more than seven percent minus.
The biggest loser of Dow was American Express with a 14% loss, followed by the Bank of America with 12 percent loss.
There's not a single piece of paper strengthened.
The shares of Goldman Sachs fell almost 10 percent.
Only a few days earlier he bought a stake in the bank by a large investor of Warren Buffett.
In the context of the rescue operation, funds will be made available for the purchase of the so-called dubious mortgage securities.
However, the amount is not to be paid at the same time but is to be paid gradually.
In exchange, the State would receive the shares option of financial institutions, which would be able to be paid if the exchange rates were to develop properly, reducing the burden on the state bank.
European and American stock exchange rates are falling behind
Billionous aid to European and American banks does not dispel investor concerns.
The stock exchange rate of the German large bank, Hypo Real Estate, is falling, and it takes Dax with it.
The US Dow Jones indicator is declining despite the rescue of the financial market by the state.
The spectacular price losses of the Hypo Real Estate and the Commercial Bank deeply pushed the German share indicator (Dax).
Despite the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, the value of the real estate funder in Munich fell to its quarter, and the Commercial Bank weakened by more than 20 percent.
Dax sanitized to 6000 points of psychological importance and recorded 5839 points at a minus 3.7 percent.
Stock markets are now on their knees worldwide.
In New York, Wall Street opened up with considerable losses.
Investors fear that the US Government's $700 billion rescue package will not be enough to boost money markets.
Dow lost 334 points in the first hour of trade, i.e. by 3.3 percent to 10.809,25 points.
The U.S. House wanted to vote on the rescue plan and the Senate vote could take place on 1 October.
Other European stock exchanges were known for one direction: the FTSE indicator in London showed a 3.2 percent weakening, and the CAC lost 2.9 percent in 40 Paris.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei index sank by 1.26% to 11.743.61.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index decreased by 2.1 percent to 18.286,90 points.
The Indian Sensex indicator dropped 506,43 points, which is 3.9 percent, and closed at 12.595,75 points.
On the Mdax Stock Exchange, Arcandor’s shares weakened after the announcement of the capital increase.
Sal. Oppenheimer signed up to 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourism group also reported that Thomas Cook's shares were not sold.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
A mysterious phenomenon has been causing misconception among researchers for years. Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity cannot be fully correct.
The Ulysses space probe flew in space for nearly 18 years.
The fuel pipelines that are going to freeze will threaten the ice-cream.
For years, scientists have been confused by a mysterious phenomenon called swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by means gravitational price control of space probes, in which they gain additional momentum in a celestial space, such as the Earth's gravitational field.
Thus, probes can save large quantities of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe, like the Ulysses Sun, also used this physical trick.
Yet, researchers have been amazed for years: Flying objects do not behave fully as they would be expected under the ancient gravitational law.
Instead, there are abnormalities in speed.
The probes suddenly accelerate or slow down.
The physicists have so far found no explanation for this effect.
The phenomenon was crucified to a swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct, which includes the crowding of the material as a curve of space.
Stephen Adler, an American physicist, is an associate of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, still firmly believes that Einstein was not mistaken and is trying to explain the swing-by anomaly with the so-called dark matter discovered by astronauts in the universe.
"The anomaly may be responsible for the dark matter, which may be located even near the Earth," says Adler.
The existence of the dark matter was only known ten years ago by space scientists.
It manifests itself to be a gravitational force with an effect on other celestial bodies.
However, the material itself is completely invisible, i.e. no electromagnetic radiation of any kind, in particular, does not emit or strike any visible light.
Scientists calculate that a good one-fifth of the total mass of the universe is made up of dark matter.
The Egyptian - kidnapped tourists have escaped
After ten days in the custody of their kidnappers, tourists who were taken to Egypt are once again free, the Italian foreign minister confirmed.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of millions of euros.
Six hostages reportedly lost their lives in the shooting before the hostages were released.
Five German citizens were abducted in southern Egypt.
The ransom negotiations are already underway.
Once again, Germans become the target of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE reports on the most important cases.
European tourists from the Sahara are free.
This has been reported unanimously by Egyptian public television, Al-Arabija Arabic television and Italian media.
According to the Italian reports of Sky TG 24, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the fact of release: "Our friends and other hostages were released.
We are currently examining their health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian citizen and eight Egyptian escorts are safe and safe - reported on Egyptian state television.
19 participants in the desert expedition are said to be on their way to Cairo.
The reason for the shooting before the hostages were released remains vague: According to an Egyptian security officer, hostages have already shown a willingness to release the hostages when the Sudanese army surprisingly killed their six.
"The problem solved.
The ransom was accepted," said the official.
"It was only about taking hostages," when it suddenly happened "the surprise."
Sudanese soldiers shot six kidnappers in the border region between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday, and two were arrested.
The hostages demanded a ransom of EUR 6 million from Germany; the money should have been handed over by one of the hostage's German wives.
The newspaper "al-Masri al-Jom", referring to a German broker, reported that the release of hostages is carried away because the kidnappers are concerned about their own safety.
According to the report, hostages release women hostages after payment of the ransom.
Men are being held by kidnappers until they find a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report.
"It led to suicide" by stepfather violence
In court, it was said that a woman committed suicide because her stepfather had been raping her for years.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, spent six years in prison in Stithians, Cornwall County, after confessing to an eight-range attempt to rape.
The court of criminal law in Trauro has become aware that he regularly binds his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle between his five and seven years of age.
In one of Trerise's statements, he wrote, "I feel responsible for his death."
During the trial it was said that Randle was suicide at the age of 34 in his home in Mutley district of Plymouth, on 1 April 2007.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her eyes and tied her to intercourse while her mother was working in a brewery.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and again chose Cornwall as his residence.
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, during the trial, it turns out that Ms. Randle, who was a volunteer at the National Trust Memorial Department, was persecuted by the horrors of repeated violence twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle, who used to have a passion for surfing and cycling, said her friends said "emotionally dead" and "saying about life".
In April 2007, his father Terrance Randle found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
Probably strangled himself with a bag.
Mr Randle met his stepfather, who ended his testimony in a letter: "I always tied him up and tied his eyes.
I wasn't sexually harassed.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and I'm sure this was terrible for his victim, especially if he was only seven years old.
This unpleasant family novel ended with the victim's suicide.
But even more thoughtful is the fact that if you didn't, the case might never have been brought before the court."
The judge added: "I draw attention to the effect Stephanie's parents have said on their daughter of the crime you've committed over the years.
If this did not happen, it would probably have been a hopeful, successful and happy young woman."
An official who loses important data has been charged with:
According to the information provided by the BBC, the government official who left strictly secret documents on a train in June is accused of undermining his professional secrecy.
The male experts were on mission from the Ministry of Defence when he left two strictly secret documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were sent to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
This is the slightest charge of breaking the law, and there is no suspicion of a deliberate act.
According to Frank Gardner, a reporter assigned to the BBC Ministry of Defence, the move surprised a lot of people in Whitehall.
"They believed that the Ministry of Defence and the government would treat the case as an internal matter," he said.
An employee who cannot be appointed has been prosecuted on the basis of Section 8.1 of the Act.
The State Prosecutor's Office recommended that the prosecution against the official be represented by Metropolitan Police for the work of the Man on the United Intelligence Commission, which is of a rather sensitive nature.
The documents he lost included secret surveys on Al-Qaida and the skills of the Iraqi army.
He was informed of the decision on Monday and moved to an unknown place from his home.
The housing cooperatives pay the B&amp;B account
The UK housing cooperatives can count on an account of over GBP 80 million after the rescue of Bradford &amp; Bingley Bank.
The government spent £14 billion on the protection of deposits with Bradford &amp; Bingley.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that use the money of depositors, including 59 housing cooperatives.
According to Adrian Coles, President of the Association of Coining Coiners (BSA), it is "serious" that companies and members have to pay.
The 14 billion important loans will eventually be repaid after the repayment of Bradford &amp; Bingley's loans.
However, the interest accumulated annually will be charged to 700 financial companies that use loans.
The Financial Services Compensation System confirmed to the BBC that 59 housing cooperatives are one of them.
It is disappointing that institutions that have been cautious so far ... must now pay the accounts of institutions that have been far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We have learned that each company has to pay in proportion to the amount of the deposit it holds. The companies share 18% of the costs among themselves.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the amount of the loan will reach GBP 450 million in 2009.
This means that the companies have to put £81 million in order to pay interest for the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Association of Housing Companies, told the BBC that it considered the measure unfair.
"It is regrettable that those institutions must pay the accounts of far less prudent institutions that have acted with caution during the recovery of the housing market."
According to the BSA, no company has been destroyed since they started operating in 1945.
"In all respects, we need to examine this case in the next few weeks in order to decide how to protect housing companies and their members from a significant account," Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 shall cover 7 months from the end of September of this year.
In 2010, a full annual interest rate will have to be paid, which can be twice the current rate.
Since housing cooperatives without self-help organisations, without shareholders, they will eventually have to pay the invoice either through higher fees or through lower interest rates received after their deposits.
The price of milk increases by fivepence per litre
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The dairy company in Jersey has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of milk by five pence per litre from Monday.
This is the second increase since the two pennies increase in February and after the survey carried out by an advisory company.
The resellers themselves decide whether to shift the price increase to consumers.
Before the increase in February, the wholesale price of milk in Jersey last changed in 2002.
Request from a former parliamentary representative of Bangladesh has been rejected in order to be able to defend himself freely
The Bangladeshn Court rejected the application by a former parliamentary representative, Sheikh Hasina, for the protection of his property, which means that he can be arrested when he returns to the country.
Your lawyer said that the court refused to defend him on the ground in connection with the accusation that, during his parliamentary term, a businessman was blackmailing 50 million dollars (729,700).
This case is just one of the numerous charges of corruption against him.
Sheikh Hasina's old political opponent, Khaleda Zia, was released for bail this month.
Sheikh Hasina will have to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but she is party to the Awami League insists that the country's army-supported interim government give her full freedom first.
According to reports, although conditionally released for medical treatment abroad, it is not clear from the conditions for entry into free circulation that you can maintain your freedom when returning to the country.
Your lawyers say that you will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Court of Appeal.
"The Court of Appeal rejected Sheikh Hasina's application for bail that it was not necessary, since it was temporarily set free and involved in foreign medical treatment," we learned from Rafique-ul Huq, a lawyer.
"We will appeal against the decision of the appeal court."
According to his lawyers, he needs to be protected on the ground so he can return to the country and prepare for the December elections.
One of the leaders of the Awami League party said on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17th.
Last year, he was arrested after the military-sponsored interim government took over, but he was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny all charges against them.
Concerns about the vaccination programme against the polio in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, almost 200 000 children in Afghanistan have been excluded from the recently organised polio vaccination programme because of the violence against the Taliban.
Last week, the United Nations organized vaccination operations in six provinces.
However, they said that for security reasons they could not reach children living in certain parts of Helmand and Kandahar, south.
According to a UN spokesperson, all this has happened despite the promise made by the Taliban: they will not attack or impede the work of thousands of personnel who are vaccinating.
The appeal by BSkyB concerning ITV was rejected
They rejected BskyB’s appeal against the decision of the Competition Committee, which instructed it to reduce its interest in the rival television tax on ITV.
The Competition Appeal Court ordered BSkyB to reduce its share in ITV from 17.9% to 7.5%.
In the past, the Committee has established that BSkyB’s share is an obstacle to competition and gives the company unfair influence over ITV.
BSkyB purchased its shares in 2006, thereby effectively preventing NTL, which has since been named Virgin Medina, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the share purchased by BSkyB from ITV was a threat to ITV independence, encouraging the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The director of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom were all opposed to buying-in.
The BSkyB argued that the coercive reduction in ITV participation was a pointless and disproportionate remedy - particularly given that the BSkyB stated that it would be willing to give up its voting rights.
New investigation of the U.S. Attorneys' case
The US Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the loss of nine US Attorney General in 2006.
The action followed the criticism of government officials’ decisions by the Chief Justice Officer of the Justice wallet on the case.
The report criticized the White House officials, the legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was ordered because it was afraid that the state prosecutors were lost for political reasons.
Nora Dannehy, Special Prosecutor, will now investigate whether the officials heard during the investigation have tried to stop justice by lying.
"The serious charges of a possible crime have not yet been investigated and have not been clarified", said Inspector General Glenn Fine.
One of the main suggestions was to appoint a special prosecutor who had the authority to order witnesses to testify.
The series started with nine state prosecutors removed from the U.S. judicial file in December 2006.
At the time, they said the state prosecutors were fired because of their poor performance.
However, it was later discovered that the state prosecutors who were saved had nothing worse than their many other colleagues, which led many to conclude that political consideration had been taken behind the dismissals.
Some state prosecutors participated in the criminal proceedings of high-ranking Republican Congressional Members, while others refused to participate in the investigation of electoral fraud charges against Democrats.
The U.S. Attorney General is investigating and conducting court cases on behalf of the government.
They can be lost at any time, but they cannot be removed from their position for political reasons.
Alberto Gonzales, then's head of the justice case, has been targeted by the state's attorney-in-chief for losses and finally resigned.
A number of other officials of the Justice case have also resigned.
In his report, the Chief Inspector highly criticised Gonzales' role in the case. According to him, the Supreme Prosecutor is "priority responsibility" for dismissals, "no-no-no" leadership, and "extremely removed" from the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, former assistant to the older Bush, are judged not to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf Eposa is recognized
The rock star Meat Loaf will receive recognition for the epiphany "Bat Out of Hell" at the Q Awards awarding bar.
The singer who takes over his special gold-grade award at the London festival said it was an honor.
The nine-minute, fifty-second song was the title song of Meat Loaf's 1977 album, which was a public success.
Coldplay received the highest number of nominations for this year's prizes in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that cross the limits of time or genres, and this is "Bat Out Of Hell"."
Jim Steinman's song was very loud, and that sound was Meat Loaf's.
The song started with a nearly two-minute instrument section.
It was released in 1979, and it reached 15th place on the hit list.
However, Meat Loaf's album "Bat Out Of Hell" has been on the hit list for almost nine years, and after that more than 40 million copies were sold.
Meat Loaf - a real name of Marvin Lee Aday - has recently had health problems. Among other things, in 2003 he had surgery due to his heart rhythm disorder after falling on the stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel a few concerts due to acute encephalitis.
Later, it turned out to be cyst on his tone.
Unknown city street, often forgotten and may soon be sold
New York City has thousands of freeways, tours and other side roads, some of which are famous, others just have practical functions.
However, many trainees and long-standing locals would find it hard to tell where the Extra Place is, mostly because they've never heard of it.
The small street is in East Village, heading north from First Street - without reaching Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 9 m wide and 36 m long, and much more like a dusty alley than a major transport route.
No street signs.
You can't practically find it on a standard map.
However, the street has admirers.
There it is, for example, the building site of Avalon Bay, recently built in the First Street.
He wants to re-block Extra Place and make sure that the new buildings can be accessed on a clearer road.
The admirers of the street include the long-dwelling neighbors who were caught in the skanka street that this was the only remains of the past before the renovations in the area.
However, the owner of the street, the building and development department of the city, is not in the interest of insisting on it.
This month, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay, at a meeting of the district municipal district management committee, submitted a proposal that the architect would buy the street.
However, the Committee would prefer the street to remain in city management and asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, Susan Stetzer, district manager of the municipal council No. 3.
"There are very few areas in the city now, and we want the Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," he said.
"There may be proposals for the renewal and management of Avalon, but we also want to ensure that it remains available to the public."
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that he wanted to re-block the small street and supply it with seats. They would use part of a coffee shop, which is expected to be rented by the architect.
The idea of Avalon Bay buying the street was first published at this meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, the spokesperson of Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it does not insist on its possession.
"The main aspect of Avalon Bay is to renovate this slatted alley and turn it into a pleasant public place," he said, adding that the city suggested buying.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson of the Building Protection Office, said that the city really wanted to sell the street and noted that the office was responsible for the development of buildings, and not the management of them.
Compared to his more colorful neighbor Bowery, Extra Place is not much historically important.
Some say he received the name "his own land" in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's great estate was divided among the countless children, and no one held a claim for the narrow strip.
A punk-rock monument, which was closed in 2006, opened the back door of CBGB to Extra Place, and the street is perhaps the most notable of having taken a picture on the cover of Ramones' "Rocket to Russia" album.
"It was a nice spot," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"He was full of garbage, clothes, barrels and posters, and wood leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers, who write about how the middle class owned East Village, object to the sale of Extra Place. They argue that this piece of public property, no matter how modest it is, must remain in the community.
Others refer to Extra Place as a rare one, which is a virtually unchanged piece of the city and which must be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, a blog writer of "Jeremiah's Fascinating New York", added a part of the story about Extra Place that was published in the section "The New Yorker" of the magazine "Városi's Word" in 1952.
The author Brendan Gill wrote: "The Extra Place is a narrow, small dead end that is still dark during the day, surrounded by rusty, iron-made storage doors and spalet windows, and where the wind carries weekly newspapers in the canals."
Except for a few exceptions, he looked the same a few nights ago.
A rat ran across the street near the back door, which used to lead to CBGB, and now belongs to a higher price clothing store in its place.
It was graffiti on the walls, and an empty 0.75 liter beer bottle lying next to a dumped fresh paper pile.
Some walkers said they rarely remember the Extra Place, but they think they could use the renovation.
Fields said that some people underestimate the attractiveness of the street in its present state.
"I spent the most beautiful years of my life in dark, humous and disgusting places," he said.
Debate on multilingual education: Continued exposure to the English language environment
In this section of the Education Monitor, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the opinion of the candidates on multilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, who is an experienced researcher and director of education research at the Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research, is the co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a school choice".
It is not easy to please voters from Spanish-speaking areas.
Barack Obama's proposals for education are also included here.
Obama's campaign is "the students with African-American and Spanish lips are significantly less likely to graduate than the white students," and that's true.
In order to overcome such performance differences, Obama's educational plan explicitly supports, inter alia, "temporary bilingual" education for students in English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to multilingual education, which puts emphasis on school education in non-English, is overlapping in his interest in overcoming the major differences in performance.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep as a primary primary school in the eastern part of Los Angeles County.
Most of the students of the school have Spanish lips and low incomes.
More than one third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, learn English.
Nevertheless, 100% of the fourth graders achieved excellent results in the 2008 state mathematics test.
It is equally impressive that 93% of the fourth graders performed excellently in the English language and literature exam.
This incredible performance was not achieved by the instrument Obama would prefer.
Sixth Street focuses on repetition, exercise, continuous assessment of skills and rejection of objections.
In addition, and this is what Obama should take into account, according to Linda Mikels, the director of Sixth Street, the school's educational principle is to "exceed the full extent of students in English" into the language environment.
The essence of the immersion method is the almost exclusive use of English in teaching other subjects.
Mikels, who is opposed to multilingual education, said, "We've had a huge success in walking into a classroom, and he wouldn't notice who the student was who came from Mexico 12 months ago."
"It works", he said, "It works for us."
Would Obama set the schools such as Sixth Street Prep as an example for other schools with a significant number of Spanish lips and English students?
The results achieved by the school should make the answer clear, but because of the education policy of its own party (the National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education), and since we are also consistently in favour of multilingual education, we cannot be certain of Obama's reaction.
Although he agrees that immigrants must learn English, Obama has recently expressed appreciation for the question when he said that people should not be so concerned about the legislation as to "only English".
Instead, he said, "you should make your children speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to reduce the differences between the results, he should study seriously the models that work instead of looking down and ignoring them.
The price of oil fell steeply due to renewed economic concerns
Oil prices fell steep on Monday because of concerns that the rescue plan for the financial markets in America will not be able to reinvigorate the economy.
The securities of the crude oil went back to $99.80 in the morning at the New York Trade Exchange.
Prices have decreased by over 20 dollars per barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, the stock exchange has been torn by the financial turmoil on Wall Street, and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices reached $ 145.29 per barrel in July, at the beginning of this month, almost $90 per barrel fell before being again affected by the inevitability of financial markets.
On Monday, the concern has re-encouraged investors even after the leaders of the Congress announced that they have managed to agree on economic rescue, which is the greatest thing in history so far.
The news has cast shadows on the concerns that the financial crisis will not be over for a long time.
As a recent event of the emerging crisis, Citigroup will buy up the bank business of Wachovia Corporation, announced by the government on Monday.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg Governments partly nationalised the European Financial Consolidation, Fortis.
Analysts of Barclays Capital say that as a result of desperate weekend talks, "it seems that the rescue operation failed to boost the trading mood of the stock market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, it is expected that demand for goods, such as oil, will also decrease.
"The future of the global stock market, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain," said Deutsche Bank, an analyst for investors.
"We believe that the market for goods will not be avoided by the epidemic".
From the point of view of the stock exchange, the biggest question is the extent to which the US 'disease' is infected with the whole world, particularly with regard to China.
As oil consumption declined due to the slowdown in economic growth, banks' analysts cut their expectations for next year, reducing their forecast for oil and gas prices by 20%.
The team set their record with the second quarter bravour
After spending more than eight seasons in the Jets field than anyone else, Shaun Ellis, who played the Defense end position, thought he'd seen everything.
But then he watched the opening of the second quarter on Sunday when the Jets turned a pointless game into a sensational game.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the game of Jets and Arizona Cardinals was fully aligned with the dark clouds in the sky.
Brett Favre, the quarterback gave Laveranues Coles a 12-yard touchdown pass, a perfect foreplay for an afternoon during which their emerging cooperation developed significantly.
Favre gave Coles two touchdown passes in this quarter, including when two cornerbacks fell 10 seconds before the end of the halftime.
"I wasn't sorry for the trouble," Favre said about all the passports he gave Coles.
"Potoli's a good player.
We've been able to communicate well with each other so far, regardless of what people think."
While Favre and Coles played ball, the defense stopped the Cardinals' controller, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, in the cornerback position, caught a bad throw and threw it back at him with 32 yards worth of touchdown.
Eric Smith, the safe player has reached out to another pass, and he's got the ball.
David Bowens, linebacker got the ball out of Warner's hand.
This last turn could have been the most amazing move in the match.
However, when the Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end, and the Jets got it, Jay Feely scored a 20-yard field score, thus setting the 34:0 score.
This was the best result the Jets has ever achieved in a quarter.
When the Jets coach, Eric Mangin, was asked to describe the imaginative nature of the game, he said, "The second or third quarter?"
When he was told that both - in the third quarter the Cardinals won 21 points that Jets did not acquire - Mangini said: "I have to tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third quarter.
We got a lot of points in a short time."
The rested Gebrselassie will break his own world record
The Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why many consider it the best medium- and long-term runner ever to be, when he broke his world record in Berlin on Sunday, and he became the first one to run the 42,2 kilometers in 2 hours 4 minutes.
With the victory of 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved 27 seconds on the comfortably flat track with the previous result of 2:04:26, which he achieved last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie set up a 26th world record in a wide range of areas where he won a world championship or a world record from 1500 metres to marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing that, looking back at it, it may have proved too cautious, air pollution would further aggravate his asthmatic problems.
Instead, he called me the Berlin marathon.
In almost perfect conditions - daytime, initially at 9 °C, and at the end of 13 °C - Gebrselassie won on Sunday, incredible, 2 minutes per 56 seconds.
Since the marathon has not started before, such as Gebrselassie, and the Kenyan Paul Tergat has turned to the longer term, the marathon record has decreased by more than two minutes in the past decade, since the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won 2:06:05 in Berlin in 1998.
After the Sunday victory, Gebrselassie told the reporters that two weeks ago, her two legs were cramped, and she couldn't train for two weeks.
Obviously, he was refreshed during the rest of the time, and he wasn't rusty.
"I'm so happy," said Gebrselassie to the reporters.
"It all worked out perfectly.
I started training again a week ago, and today I had doubts, but eventually everything was okay."
He received some criticisms - especially from Kenya, Ethiopia's Eastern African rival - that he is using too much aid in his competitions, usually avoiding many world-famous marathon runners, relying on his laurels as if he was on the track and putting world records in front of the competitive spirit.
However, this criticism hardly reduces Gebrselassie's greatness in the long run.
On Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the point under 1:02:04.
Two high-end Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, gave the rhythm to Gebrselassie after they were exhausted.
Not much more than 4.8 kilometers before the target Gebrselassie left Kwambai with one last sprint, who reached goal number two with 2:05:36, improving 5 minutes on her individual best.
Kamathi entered third place under 2:07:48.
In the female race Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, has completed a remarkable year with the seventh fastest victory of 2:19:19.
The world peak is held by the British Paula Radcliffe at 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36 years old, won the London marathon with result 2:24:14.
Because of the alleged back injury to the Beijing Olympics, he was quickly cured and won the Berlin marathon, where he improved five minutes on his individual tip, which was the third marathon long run he took part in.
He won the competition with a reasonable count: for the first time, he allowed a four-person group of Ethiopians and Kenyans to advance and become a major leader, and then started after about 30 km.
The Ethiop Askale Tafa Magarsa was the second target with 2:21.31, while Helena Kip was third in Kenya with 2:25:01 results.
A separate city, the pride and trials of black people
The Greater experience park in Orlando - a few miles away from everything that shines, loud and huge - is hidden in a quiet small town where the pride and complications of African American life have been born.
Eatonville, the first purely black city to be integrated into the country, which was the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as it was described in 1935: "The five lakes, three croc fields, 300 brown leather, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guavas and two school cities without jail."
Now it's a pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have already been to the annual Zora Festival. The event in Eatonville is held in honor of Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
Yet, in many respects, the city described by him and made it a tourist attraction - which is also included in the Florida guidebook issued by the Project of the Federal writers of the Period of Crisis - apart from the environment.
The same independent, dignified and shut-down as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that the Florida, urban blacks often refused to share their real thoughts with the white people who "know so little about us that they don't know what they're missing."
Even in the year when the black presidential candidate, Barack Obama, encourages an open debate on the racial issue, many here are distrustful about the looks of the outsiders.
"We're very careful to tell our story," reported the 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lived here his whole life and is a member of the oldest church in the city.
"I have to tell you right now."
Eatonville has long been characterised by a paradox of victory and struggle.
At the same time, the historical model of black stands is a community of almost 2400 people, where poverty indicators reach the national average.
Partly the literary node, and partly the example of the American slavery, sometimes looked down, sometimes praiseful, southern, urban, black culture that flourishes in the shadow of oak trees.
It is not surprising, then, that the residents here are both proud and defensive.
And the picture of Eatonville has been important since Zora, and it's what everyone calls Hurston.
In honest, strong dialects - like "Mules and Men" (1935) and "The Eyes Were Watching God" (1937) - he presented his hometown to the world.
Five paragraphs of the Florida guidebook have changed the city, which lies next to route 17. This road leads from the long forgotten centre of Florida to one of the locations of black history and human dramas.
Hurston, who was brave in both life and literature, whether in drumming or drumming, introduced his readers to the business of the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then looked into the more confidential spheres.
He wrote: "We find a modern public school right off the road, with a brown border, well maintained courtyards and playgrounds, which Howard Miller can barely write and read."
He mentioned the widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sales all kinds of drinks and anything that might be needed in temporary accommodation."
Thus, a few hundred words connected Eatonville with autonomy, but at the same time also with infidelity, remarry and sex.
Clearly, the Fodor's guidebook presented it differently.
This description really didn't like everyone.
"Zora told me the way they were," reported the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls.
He added, "Some people didn't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as the living special, who often visited home after his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
The 77-year-old Augustus Franklin recalled that when Hurston rushed into the city, he usually arrived unannounced in a rowing Chevrolet, cigarettes, and in long shorts in a city where people are still proud of their dignity.
He charmed most people, said Franklin, but a lot of people were faking it.
"People were always happy to see Zora," Franklin said.
However, on the terrace looking at Lake Sabelia, where, most likely, Hurston was baptized, he added, swinging in his chair, "I never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor, and his books were never published again.
It seemed that, along with most of the world, Eatonville forgot about it.
Although he was once a popular writer, Langston Hughes' contemporary, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where he lived before.
There were no significant commemorations or large public readings in Eatonville.
"I don't think they understand how much he enriched the world, or what he left us at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of the book Hurston, published in 2003.
The turning point came in 1980.
The officials of Orange County wanted to build a five-band road through the city instead of the two-track main road, the Kennedy Avenue, which was an important part of the community's life.
The expanding Orlova has already penetrated the Interstate 4 motorways connecting states on the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still walking after a difficult historical period.
Among other things, forced integration has brought an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, race-related struggles have tasted hatred with the community.
"Then a bunch of white boys came over and they threw drugs and other things on the side of the road," Franklin said.
"There was a lady who died of this.
They threw a Greek melon out of a car."
In a letter to The Orlando Sentinel in 1955 Hurston questioned the decision of the Supreme Court on violent integration, thus stating the decision called "Brown v Board of Education": "He is more insulting than respecting my species."
Today, residents say that desegregation in schools was positive in some respects, weakened the unity of the Eatonvilles and undermined the confidence of young people.
"Black children are used to being killed - I remember - by a man hugging his teacher in the morning and in the evening," reported N.Y.Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter, CEO of the nonprofit organization "Let's Secure Eatonville Community".
"This lasted until the students and teachers came from a common place," he added.
"We didn't hug our white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean, there were cultural differences between us," said Natiri.
However, human rights have helped many other Zora Neale Hurston's uplift - in black writers, actors and artists who are superior to prejudices, as he has done - with the same warm confidence and confidence as the following: "How can anyone strip themselves of the pleasure of my company!
That's impossible for me."
In 1975 Alice Walker traveled to Hurston's unmarked grave and began fighting to return her reputation.
Five years later, a renowned Hurston biography, written by Robert E. Hemenway, was added to the booksellers’ shelf of the booksstores, which was once again raised among America’s role models.
The road construction project would have started just when the most famous daughter in Eatonville was again at the centre of attention.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors considered him a rescuer.
The community started organising a Hurston festival in 1988 to show us what would ruin the county's main road.
Thousands of fans have arrived for the opening event two years later, and many have been returning to the festival each January.
A few years later, the county withdrew from its road construction proposal.
"The five-banding of the main road has made the community relived, linked to full speed, which is a real civil pride," said Natiri.
Boyd just said, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road construction project helped to change the image of the city itself.
People outside of town have become more and more present, such as Lawyer Rachelle Munson, who began going to church in 1993, and the locals began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historical List in 1998.
In 2006, the new one-seventh (named naturally Hurston) library was opened on the retreaded and retreaded Kennedy Avenue.
Eatonville has remained the cake egg of Florida: it is not exactly 10 km away from the centre of Orlando, but sometimes it feels like a suburban suburbs during the summer rain; it is as small as when 27 black families were founded in the 1880s.
(Today 90% of the inhabitants are black.)
They still take care of the outsiders who come here looking for what they can say in the history of Eatonville.
Most interviews require prior permission, and some things - such as the oldest fresco in Eatonville, which a white man paints and pictures blacks on the ground - should not be photographed.
In Eatonville, many people, including the confident teacher Jones, who is particularly attracted to the lively red, are afraid of misunderstanding their separate community.
And yet, as the Hurston festival became more and more widespread, the pride of the hometown has grown.
In particular, young people increasingly view Eatonville as the way Hurston saw his own species: wonderful, with problems and everything, neither better nor worse, as proud, as creative, diligent, foolish, and confused as other racial and ethnic groups in America.
An honest civil commitment is being made to Franklin's nephew, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to college after he's done, to work with the local government or the police, which he thinks is in need of help.
And it seems the younger ones have learned to describe Eatonville correctly, such as the 11-year-old Winter Park twins, Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
"Most people who just travel through here believe that this city is nothing compared to the others," said Alondra Kenon recently after his service on Sunday.
"But if someone stops and takes some time to get to know their history, it's a very nice city."
In New York, we all speak the language of finance.
Nothing on the surface has changed.
If tourists didn't care about the newsrooms and the huge TV projectors on Times Square, I wouldn't notice they were in the middle of a storm.
They would never realize that with the glass-walled bee-shaped offices above their heads, bankers and venture fund managers who have held New York in power have been living the hardest days since 1929.
The couriers are still spinning their metal tea cars through the sidewalks, carrying trays loaded with muffins to the morning meetings.
There are still Spanish - lipsed men bouncing between blocks, carrying as a human mules, carrying 50 or more unladen shirts hanging from the shoulders of a man-like loop.
Office staff are still in line for their sweet breakfast bakery at the dishes on the sidewalk, and it is still impossible to catch a taxi between 4 am and 7 pm.
I didn't feel like there was any crisis until Thursday, despite all the alarming news, I didn't decide to open a new bank account.
Although I deliberately planned to settle the matter during my afternoon rest in my local account of JP Morgan Chase bank, I had about 20 people standing in front of me.
Not at the bank cashier's window, where money can be collected or paid, but at the customer service counter, where older customers order a checkbook, tourists ask for directions to the Macy's store, and where new customers open a bank account.
A lot of people in front of me, I learned later from Starr, the "ordered" banker, were lined up with the same intent as me.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken their money out of the smaller banks in their place of residence, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
Money was collected from so-called savings banks (such as housing cooperatives), credit cooperatives and small-town savings banks that operate only in a single state and allegedly treat their customers as family members.
Last year, 15 of these banks went silent.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with a capital of $327 billion, has been bankrupt, and when New Yorkers left for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, is a bank rescuer with a savings of $440 billion.
The employees of the office and shop before me, afraid of another collapse, transferred their money to a bank that seemed to be a safe haven, to a bank that's buying most of the capital injections on Wall Street.
Simple New York people have become experts in finance over the past few weeks.
A woman in the local Chinese store on her phone spoke about Lehman Brothers' bank and his huge-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, as if complaining to a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the caretaker of my apartment's block changed the subject of his 50s, not Brad and Angela, or my food delivery, as we used to.
He said to me after I went to the bank, "I invested all my savings in money market instruments.
I've changed, I'm not taking any chances."
Musical tombs were shamed while Austria was on the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the Right Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, from the right-wing party in Belgium, from the Vlaams Belang, participated in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008, on which the organization "Reconciliation of Islam" was introduced.
They were created with signs of traffic signs that portrayed mosques drawn through a red line.
According to the police, the extremisms of the far right are responsible for the desecration of the Muslim funerals in Austria, which took place at the same weekend when the far right parties made significant progress in the national elections.
There were over 90 graves in the trauni cemetery next to Linz, some time between Friday night and this morning.
The perpetrators drew Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David, on some graves, but according to the detectives, they were just trying to hide their extreme motives for hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident can be linked to the elections in any way.
A spokesperson of the local Islamic community said that they were "deeply shaken" at the cry of the Muslim religious month just before the end of Ramadan.
In the meantime, Austria is conducting a conscience study following yesterday's parliamentary elections, during which the language of the political balance sheet is right.
The two far-right parties who gained almost 30% of the votes, the Freedom Party and the future of the Alliance Austria, campaigned for a highly anti-immigration law, and some of their slogans were stamped "Criminalism" by their critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, President of the Party of Freedom, who has acquired more than 18% of the votes, has also expressed a campaign against scalps and burkas and has also expressed his disfavor about food that is allegedly linked to Islam.
At the final assembly of the party in Vienna, he spoke of "European brotherhood", which prevents Islamic consolidation.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and myself, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamisation of Austria and Europe.
According to the public opinion polls and analyses carried out after the elections that led directly to the outermost victory, the change was largely due to the young electoral base, who were concerned about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter is banned from traveling abroad.
Garry Glitter, a known rock star convicted of sexual rape of children, was banned by the court from travelling to France and Spain.
In addition to the six-month ban on Glitter, the judges decided to inform the inspection authorities of their intention to travel through France to Spain.
The Kent Police have obtained a travel ban on Thursday, following evidence of rape convictions against children against Glitter to the court.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, wasn't involved in the Ashford Magistrates trial in Kent, it was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A court spokesperson said: "On Thursday, 25 September, the Kent Police asked the Ashford Magistrates Court to prevent Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain by March 25.
"Paul Gadd didn't show up in person."
The 64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities of his foreign intention to travel because of the obligation of the Act on the participants in the sex offender's register.
It shall inform the authorities if it intends to travel abroad for more than three days.
It is also required to notify the police at least seven days before the intended departure.
If he does not notify the authorities, he may be sentenced to imprisonment for a period of five years.
The Kent Police told me that they don't want to talk about specific cases within Glitter County and possible location.
The Kent Police spokesperson said, "The Kent Police are doing everything they can to protect children within the country and abroad.
"We believe it is easier to control someone without leaving the United Kingdom, because there is a comprehensive system at our disposal so that we can manage potential risks more effectively.
"The most important task of the Kent Police is to protect the population of Kent. Through close cooperation, we continuously monitor the behaviour of persons in the records of sex offenders and people living in the county to minimise the risks to the population."
Glitzer returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the rape of a 10 - year - old girl and an 11 - year - old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he should have boarded a plane to London.
However, he claimed that he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The land authorities did not allow it to pass the passport test, so it eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow them to enter the country, so they flew back to Bangkok, where local police and immigration officials insisted on returning to Great Britain.
Finally, he arrived at Heathrow airport 3 on 22 August and remained there until his lawyer David Corker went to the West London Uxbridge court, because, as requested by Scotland Yard, he was entered in the register of sex offenders under a court order.
Glitter spent four months in prison for the possession of photographs of the rape of children in the United Kingdom in 1999.
According to a source from the Ministry of Interior, Jacqui Smith, Secretary of State for Home Affairs, welcomed and welcomed the fact that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
"I'm not taking pictures on stage because I'd like to introduce the artist from a personal point of view"
There's no decoration, no barbers, no dancing shoes.
From close to the body of the great masters of the flamenco, without the excitement of the action, so we can get to know the regular faces of the dancers.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, ordinary people.
And these two sides cannot be separated, except in intimate moments away from the audience, when we can find a personal move, grasp the depth of a caught look, or wonder at the beauty of the unseatable but expressive hand of an artist who is preparing for a performance that is not on stage.
In the German Günther Bauer Flamenco-people series, the theatre of singers, dancers and guitarists is combined with this less well-known everyday page of the masters.
Through the photos, flamenco presents its specific iconography from different angles.
The exhibition, which is part of the month of the Flamenco Photography, "reflects the growing international significance of the flamenco day by day", believes the creator, adding that the flamenco-people "can be anyone's role, as the pictures are seen by the observer as stunning that these images are not typical of artists.
These people on the street are artists who can bring passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and ensnar the audience.
Stage photography, however, is not suitable for the capture of their personality.
Their identity and character are the deepest of their beings.
I wanted to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow the camera to help me inherit the personality of the big flamenco."
The Cante de las Minas festival gave a boost to Bauer's long journey in 1997, in which portraits of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers were made with a record camera.
Thanks to the camera and the selection of the topic, these portraits quote classical photography.
However, the application of the various stylistic tools is interrupted by traditional visual representations and suggests modernity. The following thought reflects Bauer’s idea of the flamenco: “This is a music with traditional roots, but it changes from day to day and is always impressive.”
It's not the dance, it's not the singing itself or the music, it's the artist's personality, it's the character of the audience.
In the days, the leading pattern of works that can be seen in the El Fotomat gallery is the search for an encounter with the essence, the artistic magic, which can be seen through perception, existence and display.
The famous figures of the flamenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morete, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicky Amigo, mark this photo collection of 60 artists.
The project has also become a flamenco anthology, which will soon be released with an album embracing the portraits presented at the exhibition.
Bauer had his passion for portraits two years ago to repeat the idea with the "Ports of Veteran Sports" series "SportARTproject".
Although the flamenco-people concept differs slightly from that, the photographer adds: "I like to photograph people, get to know them and enter their lives for a longer or shorter time.
In my opinion, the most difficult work of photography is the portrait.
You meet people, you meet people, you get people who sometimes you don't know, or people who only want to take a few minutes to take a picture.
But despite these circumstances, I always try to achieve my ideas as a photographer.
The exhibition, selected from the portraits of the contemporary flamenco, has a flamenco-people address and can be seen at the El Fotomata Gallery, which is located in the Calle de la Mata 20 in parallel with the Alameda de Hercules, until 16 October.
According to Lloosa Vargas, the novel he works on is "ready bold"
The scene and the act are unknown to him, but Mario Vargas Llosa is also working on writing his new novel. The novel's main character is an Irish nationalist, Roger Cesaman, who lived in Congo for twenty years and went to Amazon.
The author of the Literary Nobel Prize also admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia event that his current work was "ready bold" and "all signs indicate that it should not be written" the novel.
"If I were smarter, I wouldn't, but I will do it, and I hope I can do it at some point," he closed his talk with these words at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and opinions, which took hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of visitors in the city of Aqueduct for four days.
"The city and dogs" were the author of one of the most outstanding participants in the celebration of literature, and it also replaced the hopes of her.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival Award voted by the participants, an old edition of Dickens' "Our Common Friend" novel.
After the greetings of Felix Romeo, the audience received a devoted audience. The watch was quickly shortened, during which the Perun writer told with his amazing memory and a large amount of humor how he developed his special adventure of reading passion and his desire to live life; how he bridged the lack of inspiration with a disciplined writing method, diligent documentation, many repairs and rewriting; how he influenced his writer's profession Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, and what monuments his stories are built on.
The Latin American novelist admitted that it was impossible to measure or show whether books would change our lives, but he added: "I don't think literature is just fun or tisar-life experience", as it influences people and forces them to think, so he asked the writers not to allow them to be tempted and held responsible for their profession.
Because of the weather, the Pozoblanco's good-byes are shorter and the horsebacking bullfights are too short.
Traditionally, the riding bullfight, organised as the closing order of the Pozoblanco holidays, was removed from the show yesterday morning after the future horsebacks found the arena to be unfit for the battle.
As a result, the Committee decided not to accept the bullfight with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández.
Weather quakes have completely torn the ceremony series, since two of the three events could not be held.
On Saturday, the raining left the second bullfight.
The future main characters, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista Castilblancos, would have fought bulls.
So they only held a bullfight on Friday.
The winner became Daniel Luque, and he took three ears home as a trophy, and he was raised on his shoulder after the refined and aesthetic struggle.
In the same afternoon, the two bulls of Alejandro Talavante gained many honours and, as a trophy, an ear, but this was more due to the audience than to their own performance.
Then, however, El Juli, who has made little contribution to aging the fame of the Llanos arena.
With the second bull, after a convenient ride, much of the audience managed to get out of the current.
In Álava, a truck carrying two tons of hash tried to escape roadside control.
Four o'clock in the morning, 50 minutes.
The Basque Regional Police are conducting traffic checks in the administrative area of Armiñon (Valava).
The authorities will stop a van in which two passengers are travelling, and the passengers will try to escape the action.
The shipment, more than two tons of hash, was not noticeable.
The detectives have tracked down the passengers, and one of them, a 28-year-old man, was arrested, and identified as A.A. J., by the Basque government's Home Office.
The man you've captured is accused of drug trafficking and document counterfeiting.
The case occurred in the administrative area of Armiñón, where the staff of the Álava Forgalmi Supervisory Authority carried out traffic checks on the N-1 motorway.
When they wanted to stop the van, the driver refused obedience, suddenly gave gas, and then left the inspection site.
The detectives chased him, then the vehicle pulled a few miles away from the landing strip, and its passengers fled from the highway to a forest area.
The Basque Regional Police finally captured one of them, and after examining the Iveco Daily branded van, they booked a shipment of 2178 kilograms of abdomen.
The abdomens filling the rear of the vehicle were transported by the police authorities to conduct a more thorough investigation and to measure the drug.
In addition, the inspection has shown that the false registration plate of the vehicle does not match the particulars contained in the documents of the van and that, therefore, proceedings are also initiated against the arrested person for falsification of a public document.
The Basque Regional Police are continuing the investigation with the aim of arresting the other suspect, who, as we have already mentioned, has fled the motorway and of determining the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old defendant, A.A.J., was transferred to the police to conduct the necessary interrogations and then court proceedings started within a few hours.
They arrested Heather Locklear because she was driving under the influence of the drug.
Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, was arrested by the police this weekend in Santa Barbara (California), because she was under the influence of the drug.
According to a witness, he was trying to leave the parking lot in Montecito with strange maneuvers - a spokesperson for People magazine in California.
According to the witness, around 16 o'clock at 30 o'clock Locklear "pressed the gas to the attic, bit the engine, tried to leave the parking lot forward and backwards, and went through his sunglasses several times."
Soon thereafter, the witness, who, at first, probably didn't recognize the actress, saw Locklear stop on a nearby freeway and get out of the car.
He also called the police because he was worried about Locklear's life.
When the police arrived, the actress was sitting in her car, which partially paralyzed the highway traffic.
"He seemed upset," so the patrols took him to a specialised center for drug and alcohol testing.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperative and alcohol consumption was almost immediately ruled out, and the spokesperson also said that, based on the first impression of the officers, it was thought that Locklear was under the influence of a drug.
Lockler was arrested and suspected of driving under the influence of an unidentified drug. He was sent to a local prison about 19 o'clock, where he was released a few hours later.
Locklear came out of an Arizona sanatorium two months ago, where his anxiety and depression were treated.
Llamazares calls on the IU (United Left) Andaluse Federation to take action on the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, Secretary-General of the IU and representative of the United Left, said today that the regional Federation of the Department will decide on the case of the former Youth and Sports Council of the Seville Government, Francisco Manuel Silva. Silva resigned last week after being accused of abused in his position of providing benefits to his family members.
"In these matters, I am a far-reaching federalist, and this case is indeed a matter of the Andalus organization," Llamazares pointed out the procedure that the party should apply to its former member of the Seville City Council.
On the other hand, the President of the IU stressed that "transparency" should be kept in mind when detecting any irregularities committed by Silva: "At IU has always been levelled in order to ensure maximum transparency in such cases."
He added that part of the training was "the strict code of ethics for civil servants."
"The Blood of May", Garci's epistle.
He inspired José Luis Garci, whose work by Benito Pérez Galdós National Epistles, to initiate the famous anti-French rise of the Spaniards in May's blood, which, with its budget of nearly EUR 15 million, is the greatest creation of his filmography.
Accordingly, the director has always tried to illustrate the wonderful human flood and social analysis in the work of the well-known novelist. Garci told the public audience of actors today at the film presentation with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría.
The more than two-and-a-half-hour Mayus blood will be presented on Friday in cinemas, and later as the Telemadrid mini-series will be displayed in a range of more than four hours.
The great admirer of the Galdós literature, José Luis Garci, made his childhood dream with this film. All of this thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, for he commissioned three years ago from Madrid County to create a monument for the 200th anniversary of the events in Madrid on 2 May. Garci accepted the request on condition that the story be based on the National Epistles.
The 15 million budget was financed entirely by the Autonomous Province of Madrid, and Garci was given a special opportunity: he could present it with an early decoration and a costume "the confused Spaniards who were wrongly next to the wrong leader, because the fight for independence pushed the country into a huge deficit with the rule of Ferdinand VII", he said.
The director, however, expressed regret that he could not count on the budget of Alatriste or Goya's phantoms which had been fired more than twice of May's blood.
So he used the usual working method of the director of the reboot, and he recorded scenes with the actors he started the rehearsals with before the shooting. Casting was not because Garci thought it was "megalizing" and because, as he said, "the director's mastery is part of the theater and going to the cinema to find out what's going on in the industry we're working in."
Several actors of May's blood, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga, or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, did not take part in his camera for the first time.
Garci - who can be proud of four Oscars and an Oscar Award - believes that Spanish candidates from the Hollywood Academy represent Spain this year, i.e. the May blood, the Seven French billiards and none of the last selected Blind Days represent the young generation of Spanish cinema, "where it should be presented".
Garci with this movie doesn't count on prizes.
"In the meantime, you think you're working for the afterlife, and then you realize that only happiness matters, and in the end, you'll be happy to have another movie ready," says Garci with a 30-year-old professional career behind his back.
Isabel Bayón recalls the life and art of the Seville dancer Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer in Seville is also a commemorative dancer from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, born in Triana district, moved to London with his parents at the age of three, from the Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and Andalusa Mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela).
He was an artist of free dance and expert of Eastern dances.
During his moving life, he fought as a pioneer for equality between women, either Isadora Duncan, Virginia Wolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian and fought against wearing a weed that prevented the freedom of women's movement.
He blew up a dance and aesthetic revolution in war Europe, and his life fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gambo, "he recommended to me Tortola, whose personality was really impressed."
The Flamenco dancer said: "It's not our goal to tell you the story of his life, but to capture his spirit.
I've been thinking about the titles of his dances, flamenco styles.
For example, from the "pilling dance" to the guaji or from the "goat dance" to the tango.
"That's what he danced crazyly, and others say my style is my style too," he says.
The light of the performance is highlighted by two extraordinary actors: Miguel Poveda now sings again after the Open door at Isabel's performance; and Matilde Coral, who, in this case, wanted to work with an earlier student.
"Matilde forms the older Tortola, the mature woman.
I'm glad you said yes to the request, I'm very honoured to perform in my play."
In addition, Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga musical directors and guitarists, Miguel Ortega, El Pulga and Moi de Morón singers; El Pajaro batter, Rafa El Viola brácás, and Juanfra Juárez, who "plays a constant character who is always in love with love."
The play is a major demonstration of the life of a woman living in London, but it also travels to Europe, and it reaches far-reaching regions, including India, the United States or Italy.
"I wanted to commemorate him because his personality had a great impact on his own age, but nowadays he is no longer known and even less appreciated for his work," says Bayon.
The performance will begin at 8:00 p.m. tonight at Lope de Vega Theatre.
At the end of the Triennium, there's also "The diary of a recently married poet"
The first illustrated edition of the journal of a recently married poet will be presented at Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where in May 1916 Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobi. The presentation is part of the series of programmes entitled Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium (2006-2008), organised by the Cultural Committee of the Andalus Regional Government on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the award of the Literary Nobel Prize and the anniversary of the death of their two.
In this way, Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium's closing order is the re-issue of this work, the International Congress in New York, the restoration of the Nobel Prize-winning Memorial Hall and the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: It's a bright summer tree". This year's exhibition opened in May, several Andalus provinces were held and planned to visit New York for the International Congress.
The Andalus Regional Government Cultural Committee has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the journal of a recently married poet, published by Perdo Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to promote the reputation and work of one of the most diverse Andalus poets.
Without Paul Newman, it's not so attractive America.
"God sometimes gives perfect people a room.
Paul Newman was the same."
The quote comes from actress Sally Field who worked with Newman in a movie entitled "The Victims of the Censorship" and reflects the shock and inactivity caused by Newman's death in the American cinema and throughout America.
How difficult he got Oscar.
retired in 2007,
and was known to be ill,
But he still rocked everyone's death.
"Sometimes it's impossible to put our feelings into words, and I have now lost a good friend," Robert Redford said among tears, "his existence made my life better and this country."
No one was afraid that he might get ridiculous or overdoing.
A hero of the cinema and his home country went away in a particularly dark period, which was shadowed by the desperate search for fear of terrorism and market conditions, American self-esteem and dignity.
When such difficult times go on and so many easily lose their virtues and very few people remain who we can look up to, then we don't have to be Luis Cernuda to admire Paul Newman.
In the people's eyes, he truly gave birth to the beauty and truth of Plátó.
Richard Nixon was a formal enemy and protector of lost and won cases, from an anti-drug foundation to the memory of the firstborn son of the drug overdose to the creation of a home-based biofood brand.
It was a real gift for a country that was difficult to overcome its suicide nutrition culture.
The overwhelming wave of wonder went all over Hollywood, regardless of nationality and origin.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, said he wasn't a man. He died an era.
Another English student, Sam Mendes, said that his joint work with Newman clearly marked the climax of his career.
Russell Crowe, a bad boy from Australia, called Newman the greatest inspiration.
"He has put up a great deal for all of us," said George Clooney, who is perhaps one of the few who today are trying to follow Paul Newman's way of life: it requires integrity and privacy far from the real and the cameras.
It's not always easy if it's even possible in the middle of the media jungle today.
Still, there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman's a role model.
Once divorced, but after 50 years of faithful marriage to Joanne Woodward, he would have had many occasions for infidelity.
"Why else should I eat hamburgers when the roasted meat is waiting at home?"
In heaven, he may be proud that his daughters on earth are also fans, which is not common in America.
"Never was so proud of the role of a faithful husband, a loving father, a caring grandfather, and a devoted human friend," he says.
The hot road to the Madrid Olympics
Indeed, many of us have a dream of an Olympic Games in Madrid, and after 2012, it may become 2016.
But, I ask, are we really up for it?
Because if we're starting from the race last night, I don't think we are.
They called it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst of many I've ever been.
It was characterised by a prison of insanity, and if it were to be evaluated once, and I would be the examiner, the result would clearly be a failure.
But let's move forward and start at the beginning.
The nonsense started with receiving the serial number, which was why they had to arrive earlier.
This is not a problem in itself, but if you go sooner, at least get everything at the same time (including chip, to avoid later positions).
Well, that's not what happened.
First, only the order number was given (first nonsense, only to go there sooner) and (after the usual line of work), how surprising it was to have only a S T-shirt (second nonsense, since I have an XL in size).
What kind of world do we live in?
Or is it because of the crisis that they decided to save money and only buy cheaper, small T-shirts?
But anyway, these things are still smug compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to going over the chip at an awful early age, it took 15 minutes to get in the line, even to give up the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race of more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the competition started, and we haven't given up the backpack yet, and when we finally did, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain has made it even more pleasant to wait for more than 40 minutes, which has been covered by attempts to raise and attack the people.
I think we're gonna have about 500 cases of pneumonia by tomorrow, and some of us, including myself, don't have the actual time to get our position.
If I were asked about the perfect race, of course, I wouldn't think of that.
So I think we can continue to dream about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for (virtual) reception
At the MIT Experience Technology Conference, Microsoft presented the development of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of - not too intelligent - artificial intelligence, which, however, is capable of carrying out some basic tasks. For example, it can call a taxi (or, for Microsoft, a vehicle operating in the company's territory) based on information from the conversation.
This 'reception' is a camera and a form- and facial recognition system capable of detecting how many people are in the room, who are in the room, who are in the room, and also notes what kind of clothes they wear, and they hear and understand the keywords of their conversations.
In addition, you can group those present on the basis of the discussions.
In the presentation video, the receptionist lady recognizes a third person, but she knows that she's not a member of the company talking to her, and she's not an employee of the company.
You ask if you've come to visit someone and make sure you're in a hurry to help him.
All this without the blue screen.
That's amazing.
But this is, of course, the music of the future.
At the moment, the company has more important things to do, such as developing a new version of the Windows operating system.
A lot of people this week said that Microsoft had become a strategy.
Windows 7 will be smaller and contain less ancillary programs.
Steve Ballmer realized that if the computers were running the necessary programs instead of all the commercial garbage, the machines would be five times faster - bravo, Steve, that's something.
The Spanish wax has been invented, considering that Microsoft has added additional features and extras to Windows in all new versions so far.
Change of direction will be reversed.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is increasingly in the background, and the software itself.
When Google Chrome appeared on the net, I joined the theory that Google did the first step to become a Windows competitor.
Many rightly recognized that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be needed, as it is an essential element in the dialogue between hardware and software.
It plays the same role as your wife or husband when you want to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
He will never disappear, but the operating system must be calculated by "death", not in absolute terms, but in relative terms.
This week's statement by Ballmer supports this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system and increasingly to the web browser.
We only turn on the computer to open Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and more and more time for browsing than we do in the window world.
What, then, is most of the applications associated with the system?
Less is sometimes more.
And Windows 7 must be less than Vista.
Less difficult, less burdened, less complicated.
The purpose of Microsoft is to integrate its services on-line rather than become an alternative to Google.
All they really need is an example of why.
I took this photo in a lounge designed for Microsoft applications at the beginning of the month in Redmond.
On the soda machine they call a poster, they use the company's browser, "Your browser, our future."
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to browse the Internet.
By the way, a new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been reported last week.
It will not arrive in early 2009, but in the end, rather in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to market Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
After all, a cell phone is increasingly acting as a computer.
But the slip, given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, will definitely make their business worse.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
This was worn by Pablo Picasso in the diamonds of Costa Azulon, Leonardo di Caprio Edward Zwick, and Al Pacino in the godfather of Francis Ford Coppola, as well as one of the basic clothings of the gauze gay community.
And while we're on the list of specialities, we can recall the peace figure of the catecholic-carcass-carcassian weightlifter.
But what are we talking about?
I mean, "tank", as the English lips call it, but none of their competitors with Le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles can compete.
First of all, because of his elegant name - although among friends only referred to as "Marcel" - which is due to sport, according to legend, he was named after Marcel Cerdan the boxer, the singer of Edith Piaf.
Due to Marcel's excellent cotton fabric, unisex custom, its unique emblem and the small Belgian flag (unrecognizable) also appear among its competitors. These are the most characteristic models that carry it hidden in the neck of the T-shirt.
But the Belgian company doesn't just make tank tops.
The sports tops, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, wool pants, seamen's shirts, baby clothes, mini-sorts - and we could all be classified as products of the company.
And they all belong to the comfortable underwear category,
Though it is unfortunate to wear them as underwear.
They're too good for that.
"I'd love to be a young mother, no matter who the father is."
It is very similar to your brother, but it has managed to accomplish itself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but it's full of energy.
Currently, Cruz sisters want to play a more serious role in the fashion world.
For Monica, modelling means a lot more than some pretty and pretty girls name something.
He was involved in the promotion of Mango's new Paris location and in the transfer of the most prestigious fashion fees sponsored by the Spanish company.
It's a source of warmness and tenderness.
What are you doing in Paris, actually?
We will present Mango's new autumn-winter collection with my brother Penélopa. We will also participate in the launch of the second 'Mango Fashion Awards' competition and the gala dinner in honor of Valentino at the Opera.
It's a pretty dense day, that's true, but it's very exciting.
This is your fourth season at Mango.
We both love movies in the '50s and '60s; we took over a lot of things from there.
And then, a lot of times, I just go around town and watch women dress up, how they pick up and pick up their clothes - it's one of my favorite times.
You work as a dancer, an actress and a fashion designer.
That's what I think, too, but ultimately these three things are connected, because they have a lot in common.
When I was a kid, I was so excited to go to my grandmother's house, and I was looking into my aunt's lockers.
Well, that was you on the Khan, almost got in with a theme park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to listen to my dress.
You know, we dancers like to come up with our own style for classes and rehearsals to make us feel good when we look into the mirror.
And in the actress's role, you'll really identify yourself with your role when you get the costume.
You see, it's all connected to everything, and all my respect for designers and their expertise.
You just celebrated your 30th birthday.
Oh, no.
I feel better than ever, I like the '30s.
I think women are worth it, they're experienced enough, and they're making less mistakes in life.
And the biological clock doesn't worry me.
Ever since I was a kid, I've been doing what I want to do, and it's been a lot of inner happiness.
And do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother, because I was born to be a woman, and I want to be a young mother, and I certainly don't want to miss that.
As for the future father, no matter who he is.
I want to raise my child in happiness and great love.
Let's say a few words about the movie.
Yeah, and I'm looking forward to them coming out.
I, who started in the theater, am very impatient and restless, I want everything right now, but of course I know it's impossible.
I can't wait to introduce the last hour and the search for the grave of Christ.
I wonder what you think of them...
I understand you debuted on the runway with Naomi Campbell a few days ago.
No, that's not true.
I didn't go up the runway as a model.
I've known Naomi Campbell for a long time, and she simply invited me to a charity fashion show in London, organized by her own organization for a better world. I chose two of my own Mango collections. The clothes presented were auctioned, and the amount offered to Naomi's NGOs.
People don't even know how good-hearted Naomi is.
There's so many things about him that I know, and I can assure you half of it's not true.
On the other hand, I always look at the good side of his activity.
He asked me for a noble cause for the fashion show, but if he wanted me to stand on my head, I'll do it.
If the fate of women in the third world is at stake, I don't know the impossible.
Returning drunk drivers will be obliged to install "Alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior would require the driver to install a device that would prevent the vehicle from starting if the driver is in a state of drunkenness or does not blow into it.
The proposal was presented in June and is now being dealt with by the Public Prosecutor’s Office, according to which the pilot project will last for one year.
As the aim of the project is to return to the market, the driver will have to take part in a retraining course on transport education.
In addition to the Department of Transport Safety, the pilot project is also the DGT and the Institute of Road Safety Technology (FITSA).
According to statistics, 30-75% of drivers arrested for driving several times are back in the car.
This would be prevented by Alcolock because the system connected to the vehicle determines the level of alcohol in the air. If it is larger than allowed, or if the driver has not inhaled at all, the system will not allow the car to start.
The cost of the over 1000 euro instrument would be borne by the offender.
A 2007 US study has shown that vehicles equipped with such instruments can reduce the number of infringements by up to 65% in the first year after installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 people could be saved every year by this rule.
The measure focuses on infringements for two reasons: on the one hand, it is easier to prevent them from becoming criminal;
on the other hand, it is easier to introduce, since the implementation of the legal reform is in the normal course, while the necessary criminal reform would require a basic amendment to the law.
The instrument is not yet available on the Spanish market in any form of trade, although it has already been installed in some industrial and public service vehicles in experimental mode.
The House of Representatives will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Labour Party, which calls for the installation of the system in school buses, for a French model.
In Mexico, in closed shoes
In English, at the time announced in the program, 17 o'clock at 40 o'clock, Benito Juárez Airport, the Spanish Air Force carrier of the Prince's Party of Asturias landed in the Hangar of the President of Mexico City Airport.
The sun was already down, but it was so hot that we could only see the royal party that got out of the plane using our hands as a blindfolder.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other prominent personalities stood.
A few hours ago, I asked a cab driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Prince's Couple would arrive in town for official visits.
- Great, well, there's not going to be an airport transfer for a long time today... the woman from here or something...
No, no, sir, the lady in Spanish, she just lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, or...
But the Mexican press, it knows everything about the Prince of Asturias and the importance of their visit.
Many are waiting for the red carpet of the airport hangar, the cordon made by 27 sailors, who protect the dignity.
The Prince appears, smiling, in blue clothes, and then the Princess, in her long hair, in a wind, in a restrained dress, but not in the usual, toe-lighting shoes - they may have warned that Mexico City is being threatened by a storm.
They stop for a moment and smile at the cameras, and then they enter the room where the official reception comes.
In the gate of their hotel - one of the four largest hotels in the city - a reporter on Mexican television is waiting for them.
The most valuable fashion fee
For the award of a fashion prize, the world's best place is undoubtedly Paris, and among the fashion designers who live today, the most sophisticated and most certainly Valentino.
The Mango recently launched the second El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, which aims to promote the international talent of fashion.
The main prize is EUR 300,000.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first competition, saw her own design clothes in the window of Mango, under the 54th in Boulevard Haussmann, in Paris, and was almost relieved of influence.
By the way, this is the second largest European business in the company and recently opened at 1335 square meters.
The biggest store in London.
In the midst of the large event and the thanks to Valentino for presiding the jury, we finally found ourselves at a luxury dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
In the company of the most enjoyable Chagalok, the president's table for the gala dinner, made by Mango, was even more visible.
Nati, who, due to her recent death, had come with a hard heart and sorrow, carried a piece of the Company and some breathtaking glories. With her son, Luis, nearly two metres tall, she accompanied Valentin to the main table of her honorary dinner.
Andik, the owner and host of Mango, was entertaining the guests. With Rotchiil Baron, they were so chivalrous that they finally stayed undressed because they were both gifted to a woman.
Monica Cruz came into the store in her own design pants and shirts, and she wore a sexy long black dress at dinner. At the night’s opera tour, Gaya Toledo joined her ballet room so much that, by remembering the old times, she fell into one of the bars and impaled a grand plie.
Inés Sastre didn't attend the palace visit, but before he showed some photos of his son on his cell phone.
The next morning in Oliver Martinez, we were delighted - he'll be two metres tall and motorized - and John Travolta arrived at the hotel with the Intercontinent in Paris. He brought his own sheets and towels with him, and he told us he didn't want any perfume in the room.
Stars under the stars of Paris.
Oh, Ià, c'est la vie.
1001, stress relief number
There's not a thousand, there's a thousand, and there's one way to turn it off from chaotic and messy everydays.
Other good news is that we can find them all in a single book that arrives at the bookstores on September 30 to bring peace.
It's almost embarrassing to have a bell ring at 7:00 in the morning, but it's even worse to think about how fast the world makes you live every day.
The name of the office is tension, and the computer has back pain.
Stress is the popular disease of the 21st century.
But there are not one or two ways of overcoming daily exhaustion and overcoming problems at work.
No, this number is exactly 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classical massage or "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in its book so that everyone can find a solution that is most comfortable and adapted to their free minutes.
The stress relief work carries the address of the 1001 relaxing method and the calming calm comes from the Pearson Alhambra y DK publisher to the bookstores.
If you are convinced that stress can hardly be eliminated from the world of work or personal relationships, this manual will certainly be able to extricate you in your faith.
It also serves with other ideas that help all of us to relax, such as tips on how to get closer to nature or how to make 100% natural food.
If you have too low adrenaline levels to refresh your body and become the central problem of stress life, it is time to sit back in the chair, relax and focus on reading only.
People who talk in their dreams
Some kids talk at night.
I'm not thinking about people who get upset and are totally awake about what happened to them that day, but those who talk to them while they're sleeping.
The phenomenon may seem scary to begin with, but it's actually completely harmless.
This benign sleep disorder is called somniloquism.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
I'm sure they've been told he was talking last night.
It may be completely rapsody (for example, only happens once in a high-fever illness) or more frequent (everyday, weekly or monthly) and usually the next day, the child does not remember anything.
The appearance cannot be attributed to a single trigger.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night-time alarms, night-time bed resting (enuresis nocturna) or sleepwalking, but this is not lawful.
As mentioned above, it may be a condition with high fever or an accompanying event of stress or increased excitement.
In any case, there has been little study so far.
The intensity of speech is also very variable.
It may be silent, calm, it may be incoherent words, whining, but unlike all that, it may be in the form of screaming, crying, or longer speech.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is recommended to monitor the child and turn to a specialist. The study may reveal whether there is a problem of severe anxiety in the background and thus a solution.
As mentioned earlier, it is a benign phenomenon, and therefore there is no cure for it unless it is associated with another manageable form of sleep disorder (e.g. insomnia or stress).
However, there are some things we can do, here is a bunch of preventive measures:
Let us be careful to keep the child calm before bed.
Choose relaxing games and avoid watching child’s fear - inspiring or aggressive TV shows or series.
We teach children who are prone to nervousness or more difficult to relax some relaxation methods to find inner rest more easily.
It helps the child sleep more calmly.
If he starts talking while we're sleeping, let's try to keep our peace.
Remember, this is harmless to the child, and they won't remember anything the next day.
Useful advice
Don't wake the child.
It'd be pointless, because the kid's not conscious, but he'd sneeze his sleep.
Even though he's talking, he's actually still asleep and resting.
Remember, if the phenomenon is accompanied by intense anxiety several times, it is recommended that you turn to a specialist or explore what causes great anxiety from the child.
If you speak clearly (this is a rare case), do not start asking questions to find out anything about it.
It would be superfluous anyway, since it's not so conscious when you're asleep that you're picking up your thoughts.
On the other hand, you only hear the speech, but do not see the dream images associated with it, so be careful with the interpretation of the heard and possible conclusions.
Don't ever tell the kid they can question him about his secrets at night.
It's not even a joke.
It's a great deal of anxiety.
So the most important thing to do is not worry, because it's just a few minutes of harmless episodes.
Finally straight on Illhaeusern
After a long long deep-flying, Illhaeusern's team finally took a new boost and won again on the domestic course.
Although there was no ferocious game, the yellow-blacks were several times in position, one of which was finally able to win.
The pace of the match was not too tight, as the attackers had difficulty feeling the right rhythm.
The first shot was attempted by the guest team captain Kauffmann, but the remote ball had just touched the upper corner of the gate tree. After that, Illhaeuser was taken over, and the shots followed each other: Fonderflick tried with a remote shot, and then Hirn's shot went over the gate.
On the other side, the players were concentrated in a block on the midfield, and only Riahi, who was always in charge of shooting.
The beginning of the second half period was crucial: first Riahi and Temporale were placed on the side of Dannemarie. Immediately thereafter, the first goal was born: After Diebold's first shot, he got the ball out with the excellent position of Illhaeuserni Marais and then sent it to the gate (53 minutes).
However, Illhausern’s goalmaker could not have enjoyed the glory for long: twelve minutes later he was forced to leave the field, so his teammates had to continue fighting in a human race.
Dannemarie, on the other hand, was unable to make use of its advantage: there were not many problems for the domestic team, who were just a little behind to strengthen their protection. Only the last seconds held some excitement when the ball was very close to the gate after the big grab.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before you fly to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour to Brittany.
The demonstration held by fishermen on Monday paralyzed the traffic of several bretons and Norman ports. Therefore, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Le Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet the representatives of the protestors.
The latter promised to accept the President in a "constructive spirit" and expressed their hope that Sarkozy would "come with concrete proposals".
The Presidential visit is in line with the meeting of the "Varition Committee" set up by breton fishermen to take action against the rise in the price of gas oil, as the price of oil exceeded the average price of a record of EUR 1.14 per litre.
David Martinon, President of the Republic, said that "the President will discuss with fishermen what solutions could help companies regain their competitiveness and make working conditions and wages safer for seafarers".
The fishermen are determined to await the arrival of Nicolas Sarkozy.
On Tuesday morning, traffic slowing demonstrations were held in Morbihan and Calvados, with which nearly 10 km of congestion was caused.
The transport of Quiberon yachts has also been paralyzed, but the journeys towards Belle-île have not been closed.
There were roadblocks on the Quiberon peninsula.
On Monday, sailors have already witnessed their determination. Then at dawn, tyres and pallets were lit in front of the fuel warehouses in the Brestic ports, while demonstrations took place in Concerteau and Saint-Brieuc.
This was followed by further movements in other ports of the Atlantic and La Manche. In Vendée County, Sables d'Olonne, for example, the fishermen did not board the ship, while in Le Havre, some 20 vessels blocked the traffic of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Le Croisic in Loire-Atlantique County ended the huge oil refining block in Dongs.
However, Boulogne-sur-Mer's fishermen decided to wait for the meeting to be held at the Ministry on Wednesday by deciding on further steps.
In Le Guilvinec, on Tuesday, the "Valition Committee" will have to decide on its next step and participation at the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want their interests to be represented by the heads of the National Fisheries Committee, as the Committee did not support their efforts.
"The strike continues" because "fishers do not allow their demands" and "will not travel to Paris", for example, said Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen who do not pay taxes for gas oil currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but believe that the operation of a vessel would only be profitable if the price of gas oil fell below EUR 0,30 per litre.
The wonderful Paul Newman
"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" in Connecticut's home, when he was 83 years old, he suffered death due to cancer.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes also paid tribute to the film legend and profession of the 83-year-old, Paul Newman.
Embraer will not change its 2008 transport plans
Despite the global economic crisis, the Brazilian aircraft company plans to deliver 215 aircraft this year.
Embraer, the fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, can keep the plans, and plans to deliver 215 aircraft in 2008, confirmed by Fredrico Fleury Curado, President of the company.
In the first semester, the company delivered 97 planes.
The Brazilian manufacturing company is expecting large volumes on the Chinese market, in particular with regard to 30-120 passenger aeroplanes.
Embraer has delivered a total of 41 planes to customers in China in eight years.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which has been set up by the US financial authorities, wants to sell more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion advanced to it, has announced the dominant expenditure of the Financial Times.
In addition to its international life insurance and American pension insurance activities, AIG would be different from most of all its business sectors, the newspaper clarified the funds that were close to the case.
According to the Times, the board of directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to examine the possibilities for selling.
AIG did not confirm this information.
The assets that AIG intends to sell include the company International Lease Financial Corp, 59% of its shares in the transatlantic Holdings reinsurance company, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments - adds the Times.
However, according to the paper, there is no final decision on sales.
AIG needs to get liquid assets quickly to repay the $85 billion loan approved by the US Government, thereby taking the risk that it will have to become 80% of its capital and lose its shareholders accordingly.
Paris Historique study on Morning Meeting's historical Morning Meeting meeting
The New York Stock Exchange announced a historic decline on Monday, after the Senate rejected Paulson's rescue plan. Dow Jones index fell by 6.98% (which has never seen a decrease of nearly 800 points), and Nasdaq by 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index (DJIA) has fallen by 777,68 points, thus closing at 10 365,45 points.
The largest fall in the index so far (684.81 points) was registered on 17 September 2001 when trade resumed after the terrorist attack on 11 September.
Nasdaq, which is mainly based on technology papers, closed at 1,983,73 points with a fall of 199,61 points, while Standard &amp; Poor's 500 extended index decreased by 8,81% (i.e. by 106,85 points) to 1, 106,55 points according to official closure data.
The Wall Street Stock Exchange was already weak when it opened, and then when the Senate unexpectedly rejected the plan to restore the market balance, it began a deep-flying operation.
Members rejected the provision of funds requested by Henry Paulson by 228 'no' votes against 205 'yes'.
The plan was launched by nearly two-thirds of the Republicans.
"This market has filtered bad signals because Congress seems unable to approve a plan," says Lindsey Piegza, FTN Financial Analyst.
"It also shows how much the market was counting on this plan," he added, and he expressed his concern that if they adopted such a plan a few days later, it would be too late.
"If the plan is really condemned to death (...), then the Fed (American Central Bank - the Szerk.) and the other central banks will have the turn to deal with the crisis, and the credit conditions will continue to tighten" - warns Brian Bethune, the leading economist of the Global Insight.
To further increase the sense of urgency, Piegza adds: "new and new financial institutions are going bankrupt every day" in the United States.
After Washington Mutual’s Friday’s bankruptcy, the authorities have made sure that Wachovia’s banking business is purchased by its rival, Citigroup.
The crisis in Europe has suddenly accelerated, which has taken emergency measures to save the banks in the UK, the Benelux states, Iceland and Germany, which indicates that the market is 'not only a US crisis, but also a global crisis', by the FTN Financial Analyser.
The bond market has been significantly revived.
The yield on a 10-year bond decreased from 3.827% to 3.632% on Friday evening and decreased from 4.357% on the previous day to 4.161% on the previous day.
Obama won the first television match
On Friday, the two American presidential candidates were followed by another debate, which had to decide whether John McCain or Barack Obama would get out of the duel as a winner.
Not surprisingly, both the responsible for the Republican and Democrat campaign said to themselves that they were winning in the television match that one-third of the American households were watching.
According to political analyst David Gergen, although John McCain's performance was respectable, it did not prove to be "movable" enough to stop his loss of popularity: this is proved by the surveys carried out five weeks before the presidential election.
According to the Gallup Institute, the Democrat candidate is better in the fight: according to the results of the public poll published on Saturday Obama has a five-point advantage over McCain (44% and 49%).
According to Obama, 39% of those who have been asked will win the highest number of unconvinced voters, while 25% of them will win McCain, according to a CBS survey.
Obama is expected to further enhance his advantage with his partner Joseph Biden's promising Thursday performance, with his first and only public debate with Sarah Palin.
But Bill Clinton warned me this weekend: "It would be a mistake to underestimate Palin.
He's got good instincts."
McCain, who is in his 70s, is never pleased to put his own, indisputably huge foreign policy experience first. However, he stresses his opponent's "naiency" in these issues, which were at the heart of their first personal meeting.
"It seems Senator Obama doesn't understand that..." "the attack has taken place several times."
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary for the presidential position," said McCain.
This is the main attack surface that has been exploited by the Republican TV commercials that have been running since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, put the emphasis on representing the future.
He did not allow himself to be embarrassed: he was organized and precise.
He stressed that he was able to make good decisions and restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, Obama does," he cut back on the Democratic ad this weekend, which points to the Republican leader that he still hasn't assessed the impact of the crisis on the American "outside" people.
"In the ninety minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," said Obama yesterday in front of twenty thousand people who gathered for the election meeting in the raining rain in North Carolina.
He did not even put out the words "medium" or "workers" on his mouth. The confusion in the financial world is undoubtedly in favour of Obama, who the Americans think is most suitable to save the economy on the brink of collapse.
"The next week could be a turning point", he thought Charles Schumer, the powerful Democratic Senator.
According to Democrat Rahm Emanuel, one of the veterans of the Clinton Government, Obama has such excellent incentives in the area of the economy as Bill Clinton at the time of the 1998 financial crisis.
In the eyes of the Democratic President, the current crisis is the 'final judgment on the bad economic policy for eight years, created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain'.
The Illinois Senator reaffirmed that despite stock exchange fluctuations, it would be able to reduce the tax burden of 95% of Americans, adding that its primary objectives include the creation of the country’s potential energy independence through the use of renewable energy sources and the development of a health insurance system.
McCain, on the other hand, plans to set up 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
However, both presidential candidates were careful to avoid the issues of a bank rescue plan worth $700 billion (€470 billion): a very unpopular plan was adopted by the Congress last night.
Minsk: "Did you notice that there was an election?"
On Sunday evening, young people and opposition protested at the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the expected outcome of the parliamentary elections.
On Sunday evening, following the closing of the polls, hundreds of Belarusians gathered at Minsk headquarters to protest against the falsification of election results.
Although the results have not yet been published, many young protested against President Alexandre Lukashenko with the following words: "Dictator, give up!".
Some people admit that they didn't even go to the vote, "Why would I have gone? They're doing what they want to do with my vote?" says a young man.
Protests do not believe that the regime, which tried to make itself known to foreign observers for the purpose of establishing contact with the European Union, would be ready to change a democratic system.
If the elections were to be cleared by observers, they could release sanctions against the country in which 40 Belarusian leaders refused the visa and some bank accounts were frozen.
However, according to the opposition, the elections were not clear.
"We were kept away from election committees, and our observers were unable to participate in the vote count" – said Yuri Potyemkin, a spokesperson of the twelve parties, so heterogeneous United Democratic Forces Coalition.
"The changes were only nominal," he stressed, Mr Milinkievics, opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement. "The point is, who is counting the votes and, in our case, the executive power.
If the opposition's delegates enter Parliament, it means they have been appointed, not elected.
But their access to Parliament will enable them to have a place on TV, to meet in the regions of the country and to submit legislative proposals.
The opposition must therefore take a stand in political life because "the dialogue with the European Union must be initiated".
Because if our economy, which is heavily in debt with Russia, is in crisis and we cannot renew, we are risking it under Russia's control.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the result of the vote will be adopted by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe following the election process.
They stress that the participation rate appears to be too high and that any manipulation was possible by the organisation of the preliminary vote (26% of the voters in Minsk).
"You have noticed that there was an election here?" - the question asked by the Social Democrat Head of Alieksandr Kozulin, who was released from prison in August of this year as the last person to be held captive as a political prisoner.
No one was in the polls.
And there will be up to five opposition representatives in Parliament, and those who are best suited to leadership.
The silence of the night goes back to October Square.
President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission will be pleased on TV.
Blood is safe again
Yesterday, the Hema-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of its foundation. Madam President Francine Décary had good reason to celebrate because Hema-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood-sacrifice companies in the world.
Most importantly, he managed to regain people's trust, which was severely shaken by the scandal about infected blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As known, the national reserve of blood treated by the Canadian Red Cross blood service was infected with acquired immune deficiency syndromes (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
In February 1994, following the drama and general upheaval, the Government of Canada launched a formal investigation under the leadership of Judge Horace Krever with the aim of finding out the circumstances that led to the tragedy and making proposals to avoid future similar cases.
While Judge Krever has submitted his late report, some provinces have set up their own committee to plan a new blood management system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee carried out this task.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two blood services were established in Canada: one was Héma-Québec, serving Quebec, and the other was the Canadian Blood Management Company responsible for all the other provinces and two territories.
"When Hema-Québec began its activity in 1998, nearly 38% of people had confidence in Quebec's blood supply system", Dr. Decary recalls.
The situation was desperate.
"In the coming years, however, we managed to regain people's trust as a result of improving the safety of blood products and our work in this area."
But Dr. Décary doesn't forget that "trust is a very fragile thing".
Since the establishment of Hema-Québec on 28 September 1998, it has applied the precautionary principle.
During this period, a number of cases have been discovered in Europe where new variants of bovine disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob, have also infected people - the doctor, who has been managing the company since its establishment in 1998.
"We had no reason to know if this disease was spreading by blood.
We therefore relied on one of the most important recommendations in the Krever and Gélineau reports, which means that if we are uncertain about this and there is a risk of developing a serious disease, we need to apply exclusion measures. In this case, Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which causes brain changes, inevitably leads to death.
Therefore, in April 1999 we did not accept blood from individuals who have spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
And for a few years, it was no doubt established that the disease spreads through blood.
This case convinced us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle."
In 1999, a technology appeared on the market that allows for a much more sensitive diagnosis of the HIV virus. This is a nucleic acid test (NAT), which is able to detect directly in the blood of blood donors, rather than antibodies to the virus on which the tests used were based.
With the help of the NAT test, we could shorten the window period from infection until the virus can be detected in the blood using our technical tools, explains the expert.
This period could be reduced for a shorter period than a week.
Thus, the risk of blood transfusions not knowingly infecting the bloodstream has been significantly reduced and cannot be detected.
These developments greatly reduced the risk of AIDS spreading through blood transfusions.
Today, the risk of someone getting HIV-infected blood is 12 million to 1.
"In other words, it means that we should distribute 12 million blood products until someone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since Hema-Québec distributes 400-500 thousand blood products every year, it would take more than 24 years for a case like this to happen, and someone should be infected with HIV virus through a blood preparation.
I think that anyone today can accept or write blood transfusions to restore health - he is the number one leader of the Hema-Québec.
"The challenge of the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We'll never know what a new pathogen is entering the system.
It was only last year that the chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, can enter the blood with an insect bite.
That is why we need to be constantly alert," Dr. Décary continued and then stressed that, apart from emergency supplies, Hema-Québec should provide sufficient permanent reserves.
"As the population age increases, so do the needs.
Because anticancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need to replace red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population has an impact on the blood tax population, as the number of people on the network who can donate blood accounts for only 3% of the people in Quebec.
However, every healthy person of at least 18 years of age who fulfils the suitability criteria can blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average 14% of applicants do not accept blood because, for example, they are infected with AIDS or malaria, and those who have been in a country where malaria destroys are not eligible for blood for a year.
"We have three percent of the reserve to meet the needs of the hospitals.
It's very rare for us to run out of supplies.
However, we need to increase the number of donors to the extent that existing ones age, because after a while they can't give blood.
However, it is very difficult to convince people to give blood, but it is even more difficult to keep them and to force them to become regular donors of blood.
In this world of running times today, there is hardly one hour left for a man to give blood," says Francine Décary.
The Héma-Quebec, which has an annual budget of USD 297 million, provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin tissue, which are used almost exclusively for severely burned individuals.
These tissues are analyzed, converted and frozen, and then placed at Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public stem cell bank in Quebec.
The hair can only be obtained from the cord treated as medical waste, which allows for the treatment of severe diseases (e.g. leukaemia) in stem cells.
"We celebrated some weeks ago that our bank had entered into the model of a thousand cord blood cells, and every year we plan to remove more than a thousand new samples.
At the beginning of next year, we are probably starting to offer these for organ transplants," said Dr. Décary, who said that the umbilical cord-absorbing program is very popular today.
"Many mothers are sad because there is no possibility of doing so" - indeed so, as Hema-Québec does not have a way to make this complex and costly program available in every hospital in Quebec.
Football - the Impact in the semifinal
The Montreal Impact team defeated Seattle Sounders yesterday at 3:1 on USL-1's culprit and reached the semifinal with a total result of 4:3. This was the second final and crucial match of the quarter final, which took place in the Saputo stadium.
The final goal was scored by Antonio Ribeiro in the 90th minute of the match.
While the first half-time goal was complete, the second was found in the opponent's net by two of the Montreali team's middle-rounders, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino.
Roger Levesque, the only one on the Sounders team, managed to play Matt Jordan's goalie.
Let us remember that at the first match on Friday, the Impact 2:1 was defeated by Starfire Complex in Tukwila, in the suburbs of Seattle.
Impact plays the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinal.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder's team, which took off Whitecaps at 3:1, won 4:3, yet Whitecaps got into the semifinal with a total of 5:4 results.
Impact is expected to meet Whitecaps on Fridays and Sundays, but the details of the matches will be specified today.
In a nutshell - winner's goal of Kovalev
The Canadiens' favorite Tris is waiting for another season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led three great attacks, and finally the Canadiens won the Florida Panthers 3:2 out of the penalty shoots last night at Centre Bell.
Kostitsyn, number one star of the meeting, scored a goal. Plekanec two and Kovalev closed the match with a goal pass, which was the fourth victory of the team's six preparation games.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who got the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet" is a warning to the Russian player.
"I need another game to make me feel really in shape."
"He tried to get too much out of himself in the first third," noted Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think the outcome of the game was a pleasure.
He's been given a huge ovation."
Northern Charest's efforts
The Prime Minister does not rule out that the election will begin this year.
Barely finished the meeting of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest already traveled to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left) will win the interim election to be held today.
"To repress our last great northern border": this ambitious long-term goal was set by Jean Charest at his meeting yesterday at the Liberal Party in Quebec in Levis. The speech was enriched with visual elements, while the president tried to focus on the point.
During the performance, images like "Moulin à images" were screened behind his back.
The three huge projective images followed each other: dams of hydro power plants, mining, Quebec on Google Maps, maps...
Such spectacular instruments are used during election periods.
The Prime Minister refused to guarantee at the press conference that the election would not start this autumn, although he added that his schedule was very close.
On the fourth pillar of the vision of the future of Prime Minister Quebec, a 'new economic area', this includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and a number of conventions planned with Ontario.
Recently, opening up to the North (i.e. the northern area beginning at 49 degrees width) was often included in the Prime Minister’s speeches, but he has never delivered on this subject.
The Head of State, however, was limited to explaining why he considered the North to be a "preferential mine full of huge potential", but did not mention the time factor, the investment amounts or the specific order of importance for future projects.
It has only highlighted a few development opportunities: water power plants, forestry and, in particular, mining, which will be further enhanced by the growth of congested countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
On the north, he classified Charest as "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamond".
This is an area which is "twice the size of France", "the area of our territory, the area of Quebec.
It is not just us, it is in us," said the Head of State, stressing that it is intended to create a national founding myth.
He pointed out that Quebec's development was largely defined by its relationship with the North: the gold fever in Abitib, the Québec's design work, the James Bay...
"This is our future," he added, after taking a time-out, he looked at the huge map behind his back.
The 70 % of the territory of Quebec includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded itself, said the Prime Minister at the press conference.
"This is our historic resolution, which has been confirmed by all the governments.
There is a line on which there is no agreement for a long time, and if there is an opportunity, I reaffirm the same resolution on behalf of the government," he said.
On the other hand, "in the light of climate change, we need to reconsider our point of view with regard to the North", the Prime Minister said about the north-west passage which is opened every year as a result of the melting of the Arctic ice.
In this new geopolitical environment, the Prime Minister believes it is an important task to capture this area.
What about natives, Indians and Eskimos in the area?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec will pay particular attention to them and that they will benefit a lot from the plan, especially young people.
Two ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (later a delegation from the Party Québécois Ungaais), have already started negotiations with some thirty local communities.
It was also initiated by the interministerial committee led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Minister for Transport and Natural Resources) also plays an important role.
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of a large-scale meeting, not necessarily a summit, where they "create a common vision".
The development of the North would otherwise be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be coordinated, integrated and environmentally friendly," the Prime Minister promised.
Jean Charest described this vision as being in line with the ideas of the liberal prime ministers before him.
"Just as the former liberals, we think differently: our goal is to create new growth and development opportunities from the challenges."
By the way, this was one of the subjects of the coming weekend that began with the great cocktail party celebrating the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's election as a party party.
One of the decisions adopted proposes that the Beauharnois power plant be crossed into the Adélard-Goodbout barrier.
"Our politicians, including Godbout, the founder of Hydro-Québece, the Lesage, known as the father of James Bay, carried out the quiet revolution and the national distribution of hydro power plants, all knew how to make the future", said Jean Charest.
At the press conference, he also quoted another true, conservative work, John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister "Roads to the North" between 1957 and 1963.
Regarding the plan of the Eastmain1a-Ruper water power plant, President Charest stressed that the deployment was planned for 2012.
"This should be between us, but I plan to be there," he said to his believers, and his statement was accepted by a loud applause storm.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not exclude the possibility of a vote to be held this autumn, which the law will also allow for.
He stressed, however, that his calendar was already full, since the Federal Council had undertaken tasks at the Chinese meeting and at the Quebec-New York Summit.
A party meeting at the end of the week proved to be an excellent platform for the liberal president to express nationalist decisions, which have been approved almost without any thought. It is mainly about 'constitutional ambitions': the Liberal Party calls for in particular 'Québec' to be recognised in the Constitution.
I would also like Quebec to be able to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council, and these members would be entitled to veto the decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition, however, sceptically accepted the main points of the Northern Plan.
Paulina Marois, leader of the Parti Québécois, re-launched the development policy of North Quebec, which was introduced by the Landry Government in 2001.
According to Marois, the liberal government that came into power in 2003 refused to apply this policy.
If you hadn't done so, "we'd be moving forward much longer today", you said in agreement with Mrs Françoise Mercure, who was put to the vote today in Jean-Talon.
The ADQ supports the government's acceptance of the Northern Plan.
"We do, however, want this not to be a mere play," noted Vice President Sébastien Proulx, who replaced Mario Dumont, who is returning from his freedom today.
Letters - A Deprived Country
Vic Toews, the Minister of Harper's cabin (and also the Minister of Justice) took the liberty of calling Louise Arbourt Canada "drunk" last summer.
Thus, to reproach a woman who has fought for truth incessantly and deserves our all - this tells us a great deal about the people surrounding the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper himself.
This is our government, which has not delivered home its own citizen from the Guantanamo concentration camp, on its own, among the Western countries concerned.
This is a government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a teenager at the time of the crimes committed to him.
It is the only government that, despite Canada's signature of the Geneva Convention, denied its word and allowed a child soldier to subdue under inhuman circumstances.
The only government that makes puppet theater out of justice while investigating a defendant's guilt.
Let us remember that the UNICEF, the Amnesty International and the Canadian Lawyers are also demanding the return of Omar Khadr to Canada for a fair trial.
And our government is eye-to-face: it doesn't matter to him that a young adult has already been completely destroyed, and many years of torture is likely to have sealed his fate for life.
Although we are not yet aware of this, our rights, our freedom and our democracy are undermining. "Democracy": Harper is making this word sound like an empty word from his mouth.
So the time has come when morals no longer exist: they can arbitraryly beat, torture and incarceration any Canadian citizen at the convenience of a government leader who has been in a minority (and what can be done after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that you can find salvation with a party that praises the Good One, the Law and the Order. They do not see that this government is footing the values for which the good news and dignity of our country were due.
Dear Mr. Toews, shame is more like this - do not look elsewhere.
Opinion - Barrick Gold orwelli spokesperson
A letter from Patrick J. Garver, Deputy President of the Canadian Barrick Gold Mine Director, was published in Le Devoir on 17 September.
Following Orwelli's discussion, Garver states that the world's largest gold-producing company has launched a six-million-dollar suit against three authors and a small money label to initiate a so-called "public debate".
Although the judges are independent and impartial, they make their decision, especially in the blasphemy proceedings, not according to the truth, but according to the law.
It's not surprising that Garver has listened deeply to this fundamental difference.
Is it really the best way for Barrick Gold to have a public debate to destroy anyone whose position is contrary to his?
Notwithstanding the outcome of the trial, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada must spend significant amounts to defend and fight in an uneven fight where lawyers supported by nearly inexhaustible resources from the mining industry stand on the other side.
In such an uneven fight, however, the tactics are often used to destroy the defendant and make a friendly agreement, which not only silences the opposite, but even scares those who would try to deal with the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, then he should have expressed his views before the public.
Although in many other countries where Barrick Gold is active, this is done differently, in Canada, arguing parties usually do not stick to each other, but say their thoughts.
The mine would therefore have had enough to open its books and files and prepare for a real debate in a press, media, publications, paying for independent research groups that could shed light on the issue.
But it seems that Barrick Gold doesn't trust public opinion, and with one move, he's dissecting applications and letters for the protection of the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he could initiate a 'public' debate if, at the same time, he ignores the opinion of this public.
In the head of the Vice-President, this word is probably merely about the lawyers paid by bus, not about the total population of Canada: the meaning of the concept is thus narrowed down.
In a democratic state, even others are entitled to freedom of speech.
Barrick Gold, on the other hand, does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the public supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada mainly because it condemns the harsh nature of the mine.
The public is ready to listen to Barrick and make a verdict, but it would do so on the basis of civilised arguments, rather than by a hearing procedure for a lot of people. (In the context of the term 'public debate', Barrick Gold recently called on the authors of Noir Canada to refrain from using this expression.)
In addition to the surreal discussions of Garver, Barrick Gold's procedure is an open attack on the freedom of university research and the search for truth, which are the building blocks of all democratic societies.
In its entirety, it denies the right to quote credible sources, to discuss facts and interpretations, which form the basis of spiritual activities.
If, in a country like Canada, it can only be studied and discussed with the burden of court proceedings that does not please the rich companies of today's world, then will it take the courage to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wants an open and transparent debate, it could be done according to the scientific standards applied by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have the right to respond.
In our university circle, we have been able to handle disputes, differences and conflicts for a long time.
The reckless procedure of Barrick Gold shows that, contrary to his claim, he is not in the mood to hold an open debate.
This is a loss for both the world of universities and the institution of public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to finally introduce measures that limit legal proceedings initiated for such abuse.
Wall Street rescue - A deal between Democrats and Republicans
The leaders of the Bush government and the Republican and Democrat Congress finally agreed yesterday on an economic rescue measure, which has been the biggest plan since the great economic crisis in the 1930s.
The USD 700 billion plan to contain the financial crisis on Wall Street for months still needs to be approved by the two houses of Congress.
Key elements of the plan: more effective monitoring of implementation by representatives; new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of planned public funds; new provisions to keep the number of buildings occupied due to non-payments; access to the payment of the managers of the assisted companies.
Henry Paulson, U.S. Secretary of Finance, Nancy Pelosi, President of the American House and Judd Gregg, Republican representative in the trial yesterday, a few minutes before midnight, announced the good news after the two-day marathon trial was over.
"We have made great progress towards a solution that will work effectively on the markets," said Henry Paulson, a representative of the Bush Government.
"We have done everything in our power to save the real economy and American citizens from the current crisis on Wall Street," explained the Democrat representative.
"The most important aspect is that if we don't do this, then the shock, chaos and confusion in the everyday lives of the Americans will be huge," said the Republican representative Judd Gregg.
The trial was speeded up in the last few hours, fearing that another failure would damage the mood of investors.
They gave themselves a deadline for the agreement until the stock exchange opened this morning.
The two presidential candidates who joined the negotiations late showed themselves willing to reach an agreement, however, they are not pleased that the situation has increased to the end.
Senator Barack Obama gave himself the opportunity to expand the agreement with elements such as provisions relating to the preservation of the property or the payment of the heads of companies assisted by the State.
"When we ask taxpayers to take certain extraordinary steps on account of the irresponsibility of other people, it is not a pleasure.
These steps, however, are necessary," he noted on an American television show.
And when John McCain, the opponent, asked another channel if he would vote in favour of the proposed plan, he replied, "I would love to know the details, but I hope so."
"What I've read in large lines is that it's something that we all have to digest and that we can move on.
The possibility of doing nothing is simply unacceptable," he said.
According to the $700 billion plan, taxpayers' money would be used to purchase the dubious claims of American financial institutions, something at risk of unsold assets.
The plan was preceded by a 14-month crisis that started by the depreciation of the real estate loan, leading first to the collapse of risky real estate loans (second-hand mortgage loans) and then to the spread of other (trade) debt securities and finally to the freeze of liquid resources and to the upheaval of banks and financial institutions.
The first draft agreement was dropped by a group of Republican Members last week.
It seems that we've been able to get out of this dead end since the Democrats agreed to ensure that some of the 'toxic' tools of companies in difficulty are provided by the government rather than purchased by them.
In order to ensure that all members of Congress are satisfied, a provision has been included in the plan, which requires that if the government has to bear losses for five years under the programme, it may impose new taxes in order to recover its resources.
As part of the new plan, a USD 250 billion instalment would first be paid; this could be followed by another USD 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The remaining USD 350 billion should be approved by Congress with another vote.
In return for the assistance, Washington will acquire a share in the supported companies, which will result in a dividend of profits and which can be sold after the crisis has resolved.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to delay the reservation of the property to cover the mortgage loans covered by the plan and to set the maximum amount of remuneration and compensation available to the managers of the companies affected by the crisis.
The planmakers would like the plan to be voted by the House of Representatives today and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite their efforts, however, it is still not certain that the plan will be approved.
The statement against the plan was repeated yesterday among both the Republicans and Democrats.
"It is quite clear that Washington will not hear your voice" - said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the financial committee of the house.
"Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there's no such thing as a way for taxpayers."
Brad Sherman, a Democrat leader of the small assembly called the 'Septical Group', presents things differently, but it comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred excellent economic experts, including three Nobel Prize-winning scientists, wrote to us to ask for Congress: don't hurry up and look carefully at the path she chooses," Sherman said yesterday.
In Europe, at the same moment, it was understood again that this is a global crisis.
After a crisis meeting, the three Benelux states announced that they would state part of the Fortis banking group at the value of EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French BNP Paribas announced that it would not buy out its competitors on the edge of the bankruptcy after losing EUR 2 million (U.S. USD 2.9 billion) as a result of the US crisis of secondary mortgage loans.
With its 85 thousand employees, Fortis is one of the 20 largest European banks and ten largest insurance companies.
"It's not thrown out money," said Dutch Minister of Finance Wouter Bos yesterday.
"In return, we'll acquire voting rights and influence at the bank.
This is exactly what depositors and households appreciate now that the situation is promising."
Meanwhile, on the other side of the La Manche, the British Government seems to be preparing to renationalise a new bank that has been hit by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over the total amount of ongoing loans from Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which real estate loans amount to £41 billion (U.S. $75.5 billion).
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that they would purchase the British bank's subsidiaries and client base.
After this Northern Rock, Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank the British government has wanted to state since the beginning of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Farewell from the actor server
The eyes of the beautiful Azurics, some say that he had his main batter card, others believe that he had his main weakness.
Have you ever been rid of the mirror of Narcis by an American actor with a charming smile?
Yeah, and I don't.
Through his shame, sensitivity, and innate talent, he also distanced himself from the greasy style, which is the spirit of the true great monstrions of the art world.
But what a huge field he's run!
Paul Newman died of lung cancer when he was 83 years old on Friday in Connecticut, one of the last icons of the American cinema flower age.
There was less monumental personality than Brando, who was like him, and for a long time he was a rival on the film screen. His roles were more repressive and undoubtedly more vulnerable, but he also declared freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
Blood mixes are often caused by extraordinary children.
Newman was born in Ohio in 1925 as a child of a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
European roots contributed to the birth of one of the symbolic forms of the American dream.
He didn't think too much about himself, which just increased his merit.
For in the early 1950s he studied at Yale University drama, and at the Actor's Studio in New York before the theater, television and shortly later in the world of cinema.
In addition to being a leader in civil rights, he was second in the 24-hour race in Le Mans in 1979 as a racer. He was also considered a sex symbol, although he had been happily married to actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now we will never know the shadows of the life of this mysterious, closed-up actor devoted to his work, who hated the glare of show-business.
He was an honest man, in the highest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death at the end of the week was shocking the film fans: in his big roles we can see only on the black screen of memories.
Looking through his life's work, the seventh American art, the cinema's constantly changing for more than 50 years.
It is mixed in our memory with the charming cowboy "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) and the cold young man from his sensual wife (Elyzabeth Taylor), whose role was seen in Tennessee Williams' work "The Cat on the Hot Roof" in 1958.
In recent times (1990), we can remember Mr. Bridge, sensitive, who is faced with the fact that his marriage did not replace his hopes.
Paul Newman has also seen a lot of other faces in his films.
In Robert Wise's film "A certain top", the storm-living criminal boxer Rocky Graziano gave an unforgettable performance. This was originally intended for James Dean, and after his death, he started Newman's career as an actor in 1956.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in the brilliant work "The Great Trouble" which won the Oscar for the Best Film in 1973.
Robert Rossen, in his brilliant film "The Svindler" (1961), formed a bitter, vindictive billiard player and returned in a similar role in Martin Scorsese's "The Color of Money" film. In 1987, he received his only Oscar Award for nine nominations.
It's changing times, but it's always the same face: that's who it was.
It's always been like this.
The cycle was marked by a change of eras.
Younger people are known mainly from George Roy Hill's "The Icebreakers" (1977), where Reggie Dunlop, a coach of an ice-cream team, is not working on common methods.
But his fans saw him in "The Great Jump" by Coen brothers in 1994.
The series was closed in 2003 by Sam Mendes' film "The Way of Damage": this was the last time he appeared in the role of an Irish Mafia Chief.
Contrary to many cinema legends that left the film mask relatively soon, Newman remained in the light of the reflector for a long time, although he condemned Hollywood with its glare, shine, and hypocrisy.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French film director, didn't think that without all the humors, he thought that "a live mistletoe of underplay": his game was too powerful.
However, the profession was not always merciful with handsome Paul Newman, who for a long time had just fallen into his lap with the film roles.
Yet, he played fewer young and successful characters: rather, he was able to return his rolling and rebelling to perfect credibility — nervous, alcoholic, malicious, or hopeless — on the edge of society.
As a director, Newman showed a less well - known face: a very eyeful and sensitive man at the heart of his soul.
In 1968, he drew a fine portrait of a melancholy woman in the lead role with Joanne Woodward, the wife of Margaret Laurence's Canadian writer.
In 1984, he commemorates his son, Scott, who died in drug overdose, with a film of repressiveness and sadness.
Yesterday, the countless admirers of Newman remembered the actor. His close friend Robert Redford (who played together in "The Great Trouble" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" said, "He made my life better and the world".
The joy of generosity and existence: this was the secret of this great actor's vibrating personality, which we have now lost.
In addition to his legendary career, his struggle for civil rights, the environment, independent film production and his comments about Hollywood's outbursts are dim.
Many times we saw her smile on the packaging of sauces, sauces, biscuits, and other foods. She did it with quite a bad taste of mouth, although at the beginning she thought it was funny.
However, revenue from such sales has always been transferred to the Foundation for Children with Disease.
Newman never sat in his babs: he remained committed to his profession.
In his letter to his five daughters, he wrote the following sentences: "Your father has always been unimaginably grateful for his lucky star.
It was a privilege for me to be here."
It is also a privilege for us to be able to follow the career of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
He was a model citizen, above all.
What did they produce at the Zuschlag & Tsai account plant?
Soon, on October 8, the trial against János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
He is accused of fraud and other crimes, including document counterfeiting, which have caused particularly serious damage to the politician and his partners in the criminal organisation.
According to the D.A., the tender money received has been used for their own purposes, and the performance of the tasks has often been verified by invoices that are incorrect.
In total, state and municipal money, some HUF 65 million, partly in the “Young Left” register, partly in the pockets of some people.
The method also described by the investigating authority was that the tender money received was collected on the basis of a cost invoice which was not a real execution and that the associations had never complied with the undertaking.
According to the charges, most of the accounts were fake.
These are the markets in Yosefváros, where the bill blocks were purchased, and the stamps were manufactured on Kiskunhala.
And the names of the companies in which the account production took place, among other things, on the Balaton Upland route to which János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
According to his last statement, he had to look like a place to stay and a restaurant.
He asked for an invoice on the consumption there, which was then modelled on the invoices to be submitted to the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Social and Labour wallet and the Government of the capital.
In most of these, István Lados noted with his partner, András Vári, who, according to our information, wrote most of the reports needed to obtain the aid.
One of Lados' "students" was a beer house.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlags in 2003, the restaurant provided a meal for ninety members of the Trustees’ Association.
However, as far as the manager's claim is concerned, they would not have access to the hosting site at the same time.
Similarly, for the Better Future - later Together with the Third Millennium Foundation - he made mistakes in the form and content of his account in the summer of 2002.
A Bed & Breakfast in Badacsonytomaji was only three rooms, and more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, yet the account was about a hundred and thirty guests.
However, fantasised forms filled out even when Pigal Kft. was also marked, which, according to the information given to the prosecution, did not include documents on Better Future and Hoppa's name.
The head of the company, Győző Wolfs told the hvg.hu that when he was called into the D.A.'s office and showed him accounts, he knew immediately that it was fake documents.
"The stamp had our company's name and tax number in the wrong place."
He added: for formal reasons, the fact that hundreds of people were housed according to the invoice did not mean that they had a total of eleven rooms, which did not have so many seats.
In addition, the account was also for a meal, while their restaurant was not working long ago.
The zealous account holders did not even look at the fact that the travel agency in Budapest, which they looked like, organises only foreign trips, so they marked travel in Botorly as a service in the cash payment account, which also did not match the company's account issuance practices.
Moreover, as the investigation revealed, VAT was included in the document, although travel to countries outside the European Union was VAT-free.
Among other things, the rate of VAT was wrong on the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the Right Future, since the company’s service was not charged by the designated 25 per cent VAT but by the 15 per cent VAT, and the hotel’s employees only issued a machine bill, while the paid invoice was manual.
In addition, the 'exhibitors' have destroyed the account by identifying road freight transport as an activity carried out in the case of a company, through the prosecution procedure, which was not carried out by the company which was based on inherently investment advice.
In addition, due to formal differences - inadequate account format, not real stamp - it appears that the invoices for the Third Millennium Foundation, the 21st Century Cultural Association and the Commissioner Point are false.
Just as in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehérto Sports Camp, whose representatives denied that the accounts would have been issued by them.
For example, the counterfeiters did not notice that HIB Kft. was under liquidation in Nyíregyházi at the time (2001) when he was eating there, which is why the firm's liquidator, as we know, denied that he had produced the paper.
I've been made aware of
The other group of account issuers are those who were aware that they had to issue a physical account.
The Opportunity for Budapest Foundation has issued an invoice for the Third Year Foundation at the request of the Young Socialists, for some four million HUF.
The leader of Collab Kft. - according to the case file - was forced by one of the defendants, Györfi Ludovic, to issue the fictitious account.
He also cooperated with the Zuschlags with the current Biogate Kft., which in 2003 provided the Better Future Foundation, the Atlas Association and the Red Fist Association with invoices of roughly HUF 5 million, which did not have a real economic activity behind it.
Neither is money circulation, because the completed accounts were then leased, but this has already been forgotten by the organisations in their documents.
The following groups of companies issuing the invoice belong to the defendants.
Thus, the service agent of Delta Trió Kft.'s Ukrainian CEO, Iván Kubatov, is based in Budapest, dealing with fuel and motor vehicle trade.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 for the sale of IT equipment worth about HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, these invoices were purchased by Cash Investment Ltd., Kikunhalasi, which has been liquidating since 14 September 2005.
This company was the manager of a Romanian man who would also have sent the company-related documents to Iván Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
We understand that in the course of the investigation Kubatov acknowledged that on behalf of Kft, he issued an account to Atlas, Hoppa and the Third Millennium Foundation together, and he took their consideration.
In particular, at the request of Iván Kubatov, Romanian stoners founded Fa-Bani Jos Fapari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the companies actually worked, which, according to the defendant, was the reason they didn't get a job.
However, the companies benefited from it because, at the request of a lawyer from Szente Zsolt, who also prepared the papers of the company formations, he set up accounts for associations linked to Zuschlag: Atlas and Y-Generation.
On behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave 15 invoices to the organisations for HUF 14,2 million.
The D.A.'s office considered that 10% of the amounts recorded in the accounts and VAT hit Cuba's mark.
The man even used Si-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of physical accounts, they were manufactured for the Commissioner's Pont's application.
The Y-Generation and the Association submitted a tender for Modern Hungary in January 2006 to the Socialist Party's public benefit organization, the Dancesics Mihály Foundation (TMA).
They also won 500-500 thousand forints, but the amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the tender.
In order to prevent this from happening, the five fictitious accounts received from Works Team Kft. were submitted to TMA.
These accounts were found, by the way, during a house search held in Árpád Kemecsei's office at the educational wallet.
A part of the defendants at the trial, as he did in the D.A., is likely to report on the progress of the account production.
Interestingly, John Zuschlag decides to lift the veil.
His testimony so far is not too detailed, and although he has promised to speak in a comprehensive manner, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether this is in the interest of the socialists, perhaps most of the damage, in the face of the compensation of 50 million forints, has been negotiated with them, and Zusi takes the fall.
By the way, who may have been offended today, since his requests to ease the circumstances of his detention, i.e. to place him under house arrest, have constantly found deaf ears.
While the perpetrators of the far-reaching and non-reparable economic crimes can walk freely, or at least wait in their own homes for the end of the procedure against them, he has no chance of doing so.
Psychology of overlicitation: Why are we giving more money?
In auctions, buyers tend to issue more money, overestimate the goods.
The neurological-economic foundations of this known - and seemingly irrational - behavior have been revealed to neurologists and economists at the University of New York.
According to their study in the magazine Science, people do not want to fall under a type of competition, such as eBay’s auction, so they pay too much for it.
The research tried to map this "play" nervous system pattern with the help of experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was lotteryed and another group participated in the player auction while the active brain areas of experimental subjects were examined using the functional magnetic resonant (fMRI).
In both games, the participants may have won money, but in the course of the auction game - in which the overlicitation of the other party - the substria complex under the striatum has been intensively activated when the game was lost.
In addition to several other functions, this area of the brain plays a role in the mechanism of the nervous system's self-remuneration.
Therefore, researchers believe that the price rise can be explained by avoiding a violent reaction to the striatium.
To support their theory, the research group's economists also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this three groups were biding against a partner under different circumstances.
The control group was simply told how much of the real value of the product concerned and they made their bets.
In addition, another group was promised that if they get out of the game, they'll be able to win another $15.
The third group, on the other hand, received 15 dollars before the auction, but the group members lost this money in the event of a loss of auction.
The difference between the two groups was therefore merely that for one of them, the loss was stressed and for the other.
However, by demonstrating the hypotheses of neurologists, the members of the team who played against "loss" were willing to be higher than the control and winning groups.
"These results cannot be derived from any pre-existing economic theory.
So far, they have only explained the phenomena of the auction with the joy of victory and the risk-freeness.
Only the neurological imaging methods helped to solve the contradiction between these two theories, with a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should we seek medical advice?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and among the leading causes of death in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned.
The number of domestic hepatitises can be set at 100 per cent, but only seven thousand are treated for this reason: patients often do not know that they are infected.
The name of hepatitis is a common name of the liver caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities in their symptoms, characterised by inflammation of the liver and yellowness, but their pathogens and the diseases caused are different.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E via the food channel (e.g. infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (donda, vaginal discharge, saliva).
Travellers should be vaccinated against virus A and B, and there is no vaccine against C.
Hepatitis Symptoms appear two or three weeks after the intake of infected food, generally accompanied by malaise, weakness, abdominal discomfort, nausea.
The yellowing on the skin and on the white of the eyes, the stools become clear, the urine becomes dark, and healing may take two to three weeks.
One million people worldwide die of the more severe type of disease, liver cancer caused by hepatitis B, and liver cancer.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected patients will receive medication.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it may lead to hepatic shrinking and liver cancer.
Most infected people don't even know about their disease, because the pathogen will sublimely destroy their liver cells, and in many cases the first symptoms will appear after 20-30 years.
It is therefore very important to prevent early and carry out regular screenings.
In three groups, this disease is much more than average: people who have had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
The number of people infected with chronic hepatitis C virus is currently 200 million in the world.
Since the disease may already be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is worth contacting your doctor if you experience any symptoms of unknown origin.
In time, the disease can be cured, the virus can be removed from the body, thus eliminating the potential for infection and preventing the development of cancer.
30 September is the World Day for Hepatitis, which was first organised in 2004 by organisations representing patients around the world.
Its aim is to raise awareness of the causes of chronic hepatitis caused by viruses and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Anyone who believes in God doesn't hurt less?
According to recent research, religious faith acts as a painkiller, which may have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University carried out an interesting experiment, examining how godly faith affects people’s sense of pain, reportedly the British Telegraph.
During the rather bizarre study, 12 Catholic believers and similar atheists were electrocuted while all were studying a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to rule out most of the pain.
Thanks to the technique that tested the human brain, it was also found that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that was responsible for regulating pain.
In addition to academics, scientists, philosophers and theologists are involved in a series of studies.
The test was carried out precisely by strengthening a rocking device to the left of the subject, which provided the shock.
Researchers asked those who participated in the experiment to look closely at two paintings, the Virgin Mary, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and Leonardo da Vinci with the Lady Hermelin in the 15th century.
The authors of the study hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would result in a religious state among believers, while the image of Da Vinci was chosen because it was not too different from the other and was thought to be soothing.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner machine, during which time they received 20 electrocutions in four successive parts, either watching religious or general pictures.
The Catholics reported that during the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt "safe" as they "carryed for" and "re calmed, peace filled them".
While watching the religious picture, 12 percent less pain was reported than when Leonardo’s creation was seen before you.
Miguel Farias, a psychologist who himself participated in the study, thinks that a similar effect can be achieved with any strong image, even with atheists, only the right photo should be found.
"We should find a picture of someone who feels very positive about him like a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases will change our personality," Wright added.
After the great results, the only question is, if Leonardo or a similar caliber painter showed the believers the image of one of the Madonnas, what would be the effect of their pain control?
Would the vision of the Quality Virgin Mary mean even better results?
You're what you share.
On her tenth birthday, you can say Google: they are found in people's pockets at least as much as they are in the sky; you know where they've been vacationing, what special orders they're doing and what interests they're interested in.
This is still not enough for Eric Schmidt, according to one of the company's main men.
As for the sceptics who are carrying a parallel with Orwell's horror, they don't see the essence of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently said to the Financial Times that Google's main objective is to collect more personal data on their users, and this is necessary to keep to the original goal of Google founders, which said, "Let's system all the information in the world!".
According to the voiced Google Manager, after ten years of world-class work, the company is still at the very beginning of being able to handle all the information.
To the question of what will happen in five years' time, Schmidt replied: would you like Google to be able to answer such questions as "what should I do tomorrow?" or "what kind of work should I really do?" - but until then, the software will not be able to answer such simple questions, because they do not know enough about users.
Not all internet users are aware of the exact location of the search terms that they were searching for and the site that interested people left after the search.
Through the Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own surfing backgrounds, look back at what they were looking for, and then, in the long run, create much more personalized results for them - the same logic will be based on Recommendations, which will provide us with products and services based on our previously told and fixed preferences.
What if they use my data against me when they look at what I do? - they ask users who are worried about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, the potential power represented by the company can be frightening, not guilt, fear of punishment, freedom, perhaps rebellion against power in the Internet triggers counter-reactions.
However, the confirmed fact that all the terms sought are not only recorded, but can, where justified, be transferred to a third party, in such cases, there is nothing to protect the privacy of Internet users.
The strongest example of this was perhaps a coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, in which Google transmitted information on pedophiles from the Community site Orkut it maintained to the Brazilian Government.
However, even in May, the Internet operators concerned with privacy rights could have been driven up when the company successfully proved its truth in court against the FBI, in consultation with the e-Justice Office of the EFF, which makes it impossible for Google to subsequently force any aspect of the Constitution to provide any information requested by the FBI in secret.
(At the same time, the Federal Government has successfully fought out some 50 thousand websites and thousands of search terms, which it has obtained by reference to the confirmation of the Child Protection Act adopted years earlier, but has failed to obtain the search lists of individual users and a full list of websites and keywords for two months.)
So it is rather controversial for Google to assess: those who are afraid of giving their personal data feel that their intimate spheres and their personal lives are falling short of using Google's services and they are rebelling against them by means of a mutiny for the multinationals who appear to be conservatively immive.
Meanwhile, the U.S. geek culture and its wild hunting of enthusiastic computer fans, activists, users in many countries sees the next generation of large companies, the "sporting corporation" in them, unlike their rival, Microsoft, who has been registered as a world conqueror for Windows, no matter how much both of them are fighting for the same purpose.
This can happen because, unlike Microsoft, Google does not request a user identification code, does not request money for applications, open, free, constantly kept fresh source code and program package that is much more accessible, younger, and cooler than the official software history.
However, it may also be because the genes are accurate in their relationship with the very problematic relationship between personality rights and the Internet, which has just been voiced in one of the most frequently spoken keywords of recent years, the web 2.0 has drawn after itself.
Because the web 2.0 is about collaborating, leaving traces behind and using the communication channels available to us and changing their scales to individuals, the point is the same: we show ourselves.
A average youth can use multiple social media sites to link a profile from Facebook to Xang, you can connect them to other services such as Twitter or the last.fm that lists his music habits, and then all these can be linked to tracking systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, you can also use a blog that automatically displays their latest photo gallery that is stored on Flickr or Picasa.
While we can read about a number of exemplary cases that illustrate: a girlfriend can easily find out about the breakfast price of a common circle of friends, who a fraudulent friend has spent the evening with, or can fire an employee of a company only because his sincere opinion on top management is described in his blog: the concept of private life has been completely reevaluated by now.
A person who lives online is one of what he shows himself, thus defining the basis behind the behavior of young people today.
Anyone who wants to hide something, or at least wants to avoid a Google monopoly can do so (for example, using Google's search system, but also with Scroogle that does not want to leave a trail).
For example, the number of people who do not intend to register on social sites to prevent them from being exposed can be replaced by alternative versions that are not linked to huge server parks, which do not add up the best profile that we have so far.
Public opinion doesn't look so secret when Google shows teeth protein.
With the current USD 156 billion value, the company is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel (124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising surfaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, and the services introduced at an increasing pace cause serious headaches not only for Microsoft, but also for many other software developers.
However, critical observers also find counterpoints to these alarming factors: for example, the senior management has completely rejected the protest of employees after doubled the corporate kindergarten fee, the company management has found it too costly to eat employees at randomly many times a day, but it is all over the fact that in 2006 Google still held its head in front of the Chinese government and under their agreement, the company is screening all the results that violates good taste and the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules sounds like they're not going to advertise a new service, only when it's already available, but surely, the problems of the coming months and years can move the world at another point: while some people believe that Google's book and magazine research and archive project has so many dimensions that the company will soon have to face the US Supreme Court, others will be terrified of the health system, because we can build a complete health profile with our previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building up a genetic database can also provide a good source for the next generation of science-fiction writers, the novel of the popular Cory Doctorow, Scroogled, orwelli, describes the future in which a person can be alarmingly approached only from Google's data.
Two young people helped the Ostrian double killer in the remand.
Two juveniles were questioned by the police in the case of the double murder of Ostrobothnia, and there was a reasonable suspicion that they were helping to cover the trail of the crime, said the spokesperson of the Chief of Police of Borsod County on Tuesday.
Young people have recognised the act of their burden and are currently charged with crime.
Two juveniles, according to MTI information, are exposed to protection from two girls.
Criminal proceedings may also be punishable by imprisonment for up to five years.
A suspect in the Ostrian double murder - a 23-year-old local man - was arrested on Sunday.
He's suspected of a premeditated, profit-involved crime of multiple human killings.
The investigation revealed that 23-year-old young men owed a higher amount to a man of 53 years of age.
The suspect didn't want to make up for his debt, so he lured his creditor to an ossy site last Wednesday, where he killed him and then his nine-year-old daughter.
According to MTI's information, the young man was prepared to commit the crime, which is also a sign that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden on the scene.
The police will investigate the circumstances of the weapon and its use with the involvement of an expert.
The stock exchange in Warsaw offered to buy the Prague stock exchange
Two hundred million euros - some five billion Czech kroons - are offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange to buy the 100-percent stock package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange was previously excluded by the Czechs from any new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
This is because the stock exchange in Warsaw is under state control.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which will sell more than 60 percent of the papers over a few months.
The Czech economic daily E15 is new to know that the Polish offer is the highest amount that the interested parties have so far offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech papers, the stock exchange in Vienna, the Nasdaq transatlantic stock exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Stock Exchange have submitted offers.
Petr Koblic, the boss of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner and that it did not exclude that this would lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated at 5-10 billion kroons by market experts.
According to the shareholders' agreement, about 90 % of the papers could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance with a share of about 25 per cent, followed by Ceska Sporitelna Bank 14,7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13,5 per cent.
From the point of view of the European pages on the financial crisis
In their comments on Tuesday, devoted to the growing international financial crisis, European newspapers have already referred to the 'second September 11th'.
The global financial disaster is due to the American President - accused of the Roman La Repubblica - the President has not even been able to line up his own party behind the bill, which has been implicated in the wound, which aims to remedy the desperate situation...
Instead of another Pearl Harbor mentioned by Warren Buffett's billionaire investor, it is more appropriate to talk about the second September 11th.
Some of the Madrid press sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership there led the world economy to collapse.
The risk of the collapse of the American financial system is growing, and then the whole world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but following the Congressional vote, there is a danger that Washington will not provide a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is in the air - just when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
The threat can no longer be ignored - points to the Geneva Tags-Anzeiger.
Today, some states can still provide a lifespan for financial institutions that are in need, and with taxpayers' money they can save them from bankruptcy.
However, if more banks collapse like dominocas, neither the funds nor any other impossibility will be sufficient.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to go beyond their national autonomy and to centralise control over fragmented financial markets.
Only Monday, more than EUR 100 billion was received by the sick financial institutions - reminds us of the Vienna Der Standard, which points out that the concerns that European taxpayers, like the Americans, have to go deep into their pockets to remedy the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously addressed the crisis that is sweeping the old continent as a tsunami.
The "savers" do not need to spend nearly a hundred billion euros, but it would be better if I recorded: in what cases it is reasonable to extend the money of taxpayers to prevent greater damage.
The Dongo Flight Implicates the Intelligent Car
What would be the best way to develop collision-prevention technologies if not mimic barriers in the world of nature?
For example, bees.
In the surprising project presented at the CEATEC in Japan, dongo bees gave the strategic starting point to Nissan engineers to build the next generation of conflict prevention systems.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built a BR23C bio-replicated autobot control system, a robotised mini-car with bee properties, with the ultimate aim of promoting the development of a system that eliminates all collisions.
During the flight, every bee develops its oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our safety cover - explained at the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, technological PR- and R & D brand manager.
The role of the complex eye of the bee is important, which can be seen in more than 300 degrees of perspective in all directions.
To copy the complex eye function, engineers reached the idea of a laser telescope.
This identifies obstacles within 2 metres in a 180-degree visual field before BR23C, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately turns into an operation to avoid impact.
During the fraction of the second, the obstacle occurs, and then the auto robot mimics the uterine movements and immediately changes direction by turning the wheels around to avoid impact.
In any way other than the current system, this avoiding manoeuvre is carried out in a completely incentived way.
"If that wasn't the case, the auto robot wouldn't be able to react fast enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and car robot project.
It should react in an incentive and immediate manner, as this technology is the most vulnerable and internal layer of the safety shield, a layer within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must be completed in an eye.
However, unlike bees, the deviation shall not be directed upwards, downwards or downwards, but shall be of only two dimensions, and only in the direction of rotation of the wheels.
In this way, only rolling motion and acceleration and slowing were used here instead of the endless possibility of avoiding other bees for bees as an option for auto robots.
BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries, which are easier and have a higher energy density, which means that they have a longer life span than the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, the intellectual intelligence response is important, not the ability to process data, even less able to store it.
This structure must process and respond to only a few incoming signals per second.
There is no need to preserve them and react with intuitive logic based on previous manoeuvring data, so he constantly uses only a few dozen kilowatts of memory.
There's no need for gigabytes, or memory about the size of it.
This is the first step towards the development of immediate exclusion technology, which, according to Nissan's estimates, may be involved in serial cars within 10 years.
An additional application option may be the integration of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to avoid obstacles on the road to drive the vehicle to the specified end.
He's got a name for the poison baby.
The written version of the $700 billion Economic Rescue Package Act for the purchase of bad bank loans is being applied in several instalments.
Half of the money is spent in the first round.
According to the Eastern Coast Time, during further discussions between Saturday and midnight, Congressional leaders have reached a high level of debate in a total rescue package of 700 billion dollars, reports Reuters.
We have made serious progress, said Nancy Pelosi, the democratic President of the American House of Representatives, who says that there is only one agreement left on paper.
The compromise on the package was supported by both Presidents, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, Minister of Finance, said about the outcome of the compromise, said that the programme will work and will be effective, but further work is needed. Pelosi said that this is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the wagon of the economy.
The written version of the package was made public before the opening of the Asian markets in Washington on Sunday evening (i.e. two hours Monday morning according to the Central European Time) but did not cause a spectacular upturn on the stock market.
The House of Representatives will vote on the draft legislation implementing the programme, which will be subject to the name of the Economic Stability Act 2008, on Monday, and then on the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and then at the White House they welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made last night and appreciate the efforts made by the two parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, spokesperson of the White House.
By the way, the programme differs from the original proposal of the Bush Administration, which would have meant that the $700 billion would have been spent on the purchase of a low-quality credit-backed securities.
For the first time, no more than half of the 700 billion will be spent on the use of 250 billion immediately after the Congress is expected to vote in the matter on Monday, from which the Ministry of Finance will purchase back-to-back misrated securities, and the fate of another 100 billion dollars will depend on the President's decision.
The programme will be monitored by a separate body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will participate.
The spending of the other half of the 700 billion will depend on a new decision by Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can use combined tactics: it can also buy bad loans, mortgage and mortgage-backed securities and other types of "toxic" loans.
In the context of the acquisitions and directly, the Ministry has informed the competent authorities.
The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme where the financial wallet guarantees the assets of concern for which the companies will pay a fee corresponding to the expected damage.
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the necessary tools to get up to $700 billion to the urgent needs of the American financial system, whether it is to buy the bad assets widely or to avoid the systemic risk of their insurance or the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed, he added.
However, the heads of banks in trouble and in need of state help can expect their withdrawal money, which the overseas sleng simply calls a gold paratrooper, to be limited by the government.
Payments are restricted only in some cases, and the limitations depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps.
In essence, the restriction means that if the Ministry buys in the course of an auction, additional taxes will be levied on the gold parasol, unless he is retired for the bank manager.
When buying bad loans directly, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the management money is not excessive.
The image includes the fact that the existing gold umbrella contracts do not change, the restriction applies only to new ones in order to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in American history that there will be legal restrictions on the remuneration of CEOs - he commented on the measure by the President of the House's Committee on Financial Services, Barney Frank, the Democratic Party.
In addition, in the banks participating in the programme, the state obtains the right to acquire shares, thus reducing the risk for taxpayers, since they can eventually win the transaction as soon as the economy and the bank saved together.
The draft law states that in the next five years, the President will have to submit to Congress a presentation on how to return the expected losses to taxpayers from the financial sector.
Of course, there were people on both sides who expressed doubts about the plan.
That is not what American citizens have asked us to do, that is to say it does not protect taxpayers' dollars, said the Republican representative of Darrell Issa, California.
According to Mary Captor of Ohio Democrat, the measures were driven by the same people who were responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Domestic sales prices in the processing sector also increased by a small increase of 0.1 per cent compared to July.
The largest increase in prices occurred in August 2008 in the leather sector (2.8 per cent), mainly due to an increase in the monthly price of bags, straps and footwear production of 4.6 per cent and 2.5 per cent.
The higher price level of plastics and chemical materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of chemical and product production in the sector (1.6 per cent).
There was a fall in prices in the sectors of oil processing (1.4 per cent), electrical machinery, instrument production (0.9 per cent) and, to a minimum, wood processing (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, publishers and printing activities have not changed.
In the other processing sectors, price increases were measured between 0.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, which represent a significant weight in domestic sales of the industry, prices increased by 0.3% in August, mainly due to the protracted impact of the official gas price increase from 1 July.
Compared to twelve months, prices increased to the greatest extent in the oil processing sector (32.4 per cent) as regards domestic sales of processing industries.
The production of metal processing products in the sector has been subject to an increase of 13.2 per cent in the area of food, drink and tobacco production.
The fall in prices occurred in sectors such as textiles, textiles (2.5 per cent) and electrical machinery (0.3 per cent).

Next year, don't you need a visa to the United States?
Kinga Göncz sees a good chance that the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will enter into force around 12 January - the Foreign Minister spoke about this in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarians.
In his view, "now everything depends on the time-out of the electronic access and control system across the sea".
At the same time, he pointed out that there would be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists would have to register before leaving.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be negotiating in Washington from now on.
He will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will be handed over by the Central Cross of the Republic of Hungary to the Star will be honoured and held discussions with the Democratic Party of Barack Obama and the Republican candidate foreign policy advisors of John McCain.
Next to the bank rescue package is Barack Obama and McCain
Barack Obama and John McCain, both the presidents of the two big American parties, have provided their support for the government's $700 billion rescue package on Sunday, but there is a politician who calls for the Minister of Finance to resign.
After days of negotiations between the Congress and the administration, they announced on Sunday morning: a principle agreement on the bank rescue package was concluded.
The crisis in Wall Street and the financial package to melt the frozen credit market have become a central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain express themselves in a way that is more suitable for their competitors to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest surveys, as the economic issue came to the fore, Obama once again gained some advantage, the advantage of McCain, which he acquired after the Republican Convention, was nominated as Vice-President of Sarah Palin.
Obama expressed hope at a campaign meeting in Detroit on Sunday that the 700 - billion - bill would be adopted quickly by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contained the CPCs that he supported.
"We must act now, with responsibility (...) with your jobs, your savings, your entire industries, the threat to the stability of the economy as a whole," he said before the 35 thousand crowds.
He didn't miss calling McCain's economic ideas out of time.
McCain explained in an interview to ABC, "this is all going to be hard for us to swallow (...) but nothing can simply go the way".
The Republican Senator stated that the proposal included the setting up of the Finance Minister's Supervisory Committee and the restriction of the discharge of top leaders, he insisted on these.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no meaningful role in the negotiations, but he had a daily relationship with the Minister.
President Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will hopefully vote on the bill on Monday.
The German language field has a flat view
The camp on the right is intact, and only within the camp have the electors become more conscious, so Der Spiegel analyses the weak role of CSU in Bavaria.
The Haiders are ready to govern Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In an Internet edition of the German news magazine on the left, Franz Walter, the Bajoran Revolution, analyses the causes of CSU’s dramatic defeat.
According to the known politicalologist, CSU's erosion began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over his office.
For decades, Christian Socialists have renewed Bavaria - and these modern citizens are turning away from them.
Age change is also the problem of all Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel.
The failure was not quite surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process has ended, which was almost exactly possible for ten years: an undisputed hegemony of a state party has ceased.
For the first time since the 50s, CSU landed at 47.7% in 1998.
This has been repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, so he mentioned so much in the Stoiber era.
This is due to the consistent modernisation of CSU in the province, which eats its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they have been very wrong at the pace. However, the loyalty of the voters CSU could not have been without consequences for the secularization, educational results, the entry of the East and North Germans into the developing regions of Bavaria.
Modernisation is accompanied by an increase in opportunities, and its political consequences are visible.
The camp on the right is intact, but only within the camp did the electors become more self-conscious, more critical, more self-conscious.
It is also noticeable that in the last few weeks, the classical civilian groups have been most absent from CSU; free occupations, industrialists, graduates and graduates.
CSU's support has already narrowed to 40% here.
Die Presse (dipresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily "Who? The party presidents deal with the confusing domestic political situation that arose after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits SPÖ from interference with internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, and the Greens do not want to agree on the coalition.
The election has taken place, now everything is about the coalition; in the debate on public service television, the party leaders barely allowed access to their cards.
Werner Faymann SPÖ confirmed that he wanted to negotiate with the ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to show that it is possible to work together between the two parties - in some provinces and in the social partnership.
The question of whether a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer - the current President of the ÖVP, as can be imagined with an initial, - was left open by Faymann.
As you said, the Schüssel-Molter course was nevertheless awarded.
Repeating this direction is not an option.
Molterer had a careful response to red offers.
As you said, there will certainly be no effective cooperation if Faymann tries to intervene in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
To choose the opposition or to enter the coalition, it is fully open in the party, the questions must be discussed within the ÖVP.
President Jörg Haider BZÖ has repeatedly shown himself to be open in all directions.
"To prevent the red and black coalition, we are ready to take responsibility for government," said Haider.
Wáróka: We must break poverty, the vicious circle of segregation
Today, in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities started this year, the French Presidency of the European Union will be its host.
Lívia Járóka, the Fidesz representative of the European People's Party, called attention to educational segregation in her message as one of the main speakers of the professional consultation, because this is one of the most serious violations affecting Roma children and, moreover, the most serious obstacle to their validity.
A high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Representatives of the governments, the European social partners and the most important European legal and civil society organisations in the area of equal opportunities have been invited to the meeting.
Ms Járóka, according to the press office of the Fidesz EP Group, warned that, in addition to discrimination in recruitment, the Roma were mainly deprived of the labour market because of their low educational capacity.
"The vast majority of Roma young people do not have secondary education and because of low-quality primary education, only an insignificant proportion of them can obtain higher education".
Járóka also stressed that, as a fundamental human right, education has a key role to play in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investing in early education for Roma children could mean strengthening the economies of the EU Member States.
According to the honourable Member, it is necessary to raise awareness of these links in the broadest circle - including between the Roma and non-Romas.
As the Roma student starts school as early as possible, the chances of becoming productive members of the labour market are increasing; they contribute to the national budget through taxes paid after income and consumption.
"The Roma must guarantee their right to quality education in the right of EU citizenship and guarantee the eradication of their low-quality and separate education", highlighted Livia Járóka.
The honourable Member believes that the objective of the European Union and its action-oriented coordination are essential to speed up school desegregation processes and to ensure that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives are properly complied with.
"It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, unemployment, and to give Roma children the opportunities of democracy in order to contribute to the future of Europe as a fully-fledged citizen", Járóka called for.
In the spirit of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities, which has been held annually since last year's Berlin, aims to provide a unique forum to promote the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and national level.
CSU: Grace for a transitional period
At the end of October, they will decide on the double fate of the torn Huber-Beckstein
Despite the gruesome fall in elections, the heads have not fallen, and at the peaks of the Bajoran CSU, they have been dissatisfied with discussing personal issues for the time being.
President Erwin Huber and Head of Government of Günther Beckstein will remain in place, asking how long the grace will last.
On the last weekend of October, the fate of a 17 - percent disaster-related tandem will be decided by extraordinary parties.
In any case, the members of the many critical couples felt that they did not hold all their strength to their chairs.
They tried to calm down the angry members of the group and the base, who one day demanded a personal consensus after "bajor tsunami" because of the loss of an absolute majority.
Five years ago, with Edmund Stoiber's leadership at the top of his career, the Christian Social Union gained 60,7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, it ran only 43,4 percent of their strength.
For 46 years CSU has been a "exclusive" in Bavaria, which provides 18% of German GDP.
At the same time, conservatives continue to count heavily on the Hungarian economy in a key southern region, and in future they will certainly have to make a coalition.
As one of the first signs of intra-party restructuring, Horst Seehofer, a potential successor to Huber, and the Federal Minister of Agriculture, will also be present in the narrow exploration team that will begin negotiations with the liberal FDP and Free Electors, which will be organised along the right values, on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange finter of fate is that Gabriele Pauli, on the Free Electors' list, took advantage of Stoiber's action against as a double coup, and then he was spared by the ambitious municipal politician.
The CSU leaders are now using all their energy to stabilize Beckstein somehow.
In the transition, Stoiber, the former Prime Minister and former CSU President of the Province, will also play an active role in the process of calling 28 September the heaviest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber drew some epoch comments to the CDU, saying that they would have earned much more support from the brotherhood party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning to CDU and Angela Merkel.
Following the election of the Bundestag due in September 2009, Merkel will not be a Chancellor if the CSU, which is a major success in the country of 2005, is somehow not declared back on its feet.
According to Merkel, his frustration over the fiasco, the loss of CSU soil will not have a negative impact on the large coalition in Berlin.
Which, of course, is relative: the damaged CSU will not be easier to handle, and the social-democratic crisis will continue.
The SPD has achieved its weakest score in Bavaria by 18.6% since 1946.
Lukasenko counter-: 110-0
No opposition MP has entered the Belarusian Parliament following the Sunday elections.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the welfare and stability provided in the country led by Alexander Lukasenko, but according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (ESCO), the illegality committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the hundreds of tens of people in the 10 million country lacks the opposition for a good decade, before yesterday's elections, the opposition, called the United Democratic Forces (ODS), seriously hoped that, following the amendment of the Constitution, Lukashenko would 'allow' the appearance of a few opposition representatives in Parliament who would renew the mandate of the President of the debated elections in 2006.
The ODS therefore ceased to be considered as a boy.
In the background of opposition expectations, Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia, has borrowed credit for the reduction of the constantly expensive Russian imports of natural gas and has also contributed to the delivery of Belzgaz, who holds gas pipelines across the country, to improve its relationship with the EU, to which Lukaskenko and several high-ranking politicians will not be allowed to enter because of the political arrangement of Belarus, which is recognised as an anti-democratic.
He pointed out that, when assessing the election campaign, the OSCE placed emphasis on positive movements rather than on shortcomings - such as banning opposition candidates from leaving third.
However, the ESF's rapid report on Monday has already objected to the campaign - during which the opposition candidates were essentially unable to appear in the press - and in particular that the opposition could not have been present in counting votes.
At the same time, however, according to the opposition, there is a marked improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is also willing to have a minor conflict with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which is falling apart from Georgia, although Russia - which makes Belarus a federal state on paper - considers the two areas to be independent for a month now.
- We have taken two steps forward, one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has started - said to our page, Mr Milinkevics.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this should continue, despite the fact that 'power was afraid to allow even one of the oppositions to enter the weightless Parliament'.
The opposition does not plan protest actions in the light of the results, rather trying to send a message to the voters about the need for economic reforms.
- We have a lot of problems with this, we have to print opposition papers in Russia, there are obstacles to distribution by local authorities, but I see that more and more people support change, including among the elderly, said Milinkevics, referring to Lukashenko's regime, which considers the main result of the creation of social security, even the most officially supported pensioners, to be inadequate.
- Because of the country's indebtedness, the increase in trade deficits, it's time to break social security "to call for silence", he thought Milinkevics.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers declared the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebeyev, leader of the Community of Independent States mission, told the Russian news agency in Novoszty, "people believe not words, but deeds," so the lack of opposition is proof of maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "Morning only before working hours"
In the history of the Chigi Palace, the doors were uniquely installed for the entry and entry of workers.
As of today, this new measure will take effect against skilled people, filtering out those who block and then drinking coffee at work.
Today, the anti-journal novelty was presented by Renato Brunetta Minister of Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Prime Minister's Office.
"The corridors - said Brunetta - are for better and more efficient work, for reducing the deficits and for increasing services"
"There will be a new, more responsible and more transparent period.
This is the real reform," Brunetta stressed.
Chigi Palace will complete the equipment of all the buildings of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says that "the installation of the passageways is also symbolicly important".
The Secretary-General confirmed: "The workers approved the measure, everyone cooperated."
In fact, breakfast is over at work, no more coffee and brios.
Brunetta advises with a smile: "a good cappuccino at 7:00 a.m. can do wonders."
At the Roman Administrative College
At a meeting, the Minister said: "In three months, the public sector workers' deficits have been reduced by 50 percent, which means 60 thousand more jobs in one year".
At the same time, he added that the Italian administration should be more efficient.
, "The wage dynamics of which, according to the Minister, have been twice the size of the private sector in the last eight to ten years and well above the inflation rate".
At the same time, thousands of civil servants gathered together, joining the application supported by the Organisation for the Protection of the Environment and Consumer Protection of Italy to protest against the provisions of the Brunetta Regulation.
"While the Minister of Administration is proud of the data that support the reduction of the deficits due to the disease, "the war on tireless divers is constantly growing," says the Consumer Protection Association.
Thousands of honest and hard-working administrative staff have gathered throughout Italy to declare war on the illegal regulations of the regulation."
The regional administrative court is faced with, inter alia, the abolition of supplementary nutrition allowance for service-related diseases, the extension of the stay of sick leave for workers at home, which means the period during which a patient visitor may appear and several other aspects of the new provisions prescribed by the Minister.
Accidents at work: According to Napolitano prevention is more important than anything else
In Italy, 2.500 workplace accidents occur every day, with 3 deaths and 27 permanent disability.
According to the accident insurance company data, nearly 1,200 deaths occurred at the workplace in 2007.
The figures bear witness to the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death, and that requires nearly twice as many sacrifices as manslaughter.
Today, Anmil organizes for the 58th time in every county of Italy, the victims of accidents at work traditionally held on the second Sunday of October, to draw the attention of institutions, social organisations and mass communication to this dramatic problem.
"The worrying data reported by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of the last few days, show that prevention plays a major role in workplace accidents," said the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano, in his message to Pietro Mercandelli, the President of the National Association of Disasters at Work.
The Head of State sincerely acknowledged the "sustainable commitment of the Union to the prevention of work, the protection of the interests of workers affected by the accident, the assistance of members of the families of the victims and the detention of the public".
"They are naturally and sincerely divided by everyone's problems, such as these, with their size and interest in the media and in the public, but in reality we have to face dramatic, repeated events every day".
Napolitano openly admits: "We are struggling with a double lack of resources, funding education and information is crucial.
In-school initiatives aimed at providing direct information to young people who are about to enter the world of work are of particular importance.
It is our duty to maintain interest in the phenomenon, not to allow attention to be drawn to the social importance of the issue, and we need more effective legislation that needs to be put in place.
The president of the Lower House, Gianfranco Fini, himself stressed that "the serious social importance of fatal accidents at work, which all of us have, and the institutions are required to put an end to it as soon as possible".
"The data on accidents at work show a slight improvement, but the number of deaths of this kind is still incredibly high" said Pietro Mercandelli, president of Anmil.
"We do not, however, want this decreasing trend to be combined with less attention, because it is precisely when attention is reduced that the greatest tragedy occurs."
"We do not believe that, at the general level, we are still doing everything we can to combat this phenomenon, which could be resolved through a complex action programme.
We believe that more supervision and control is needed - stressed Mercandelli - and a stronger intervention in the field of labour market training, starting with school education."
"More efforts are needed to inform and capture the public," he added.
What would be most necessary, however, is a more responsible employer environment against a phenomenon that is a social problem."
Mercandelli then criticised "the gradual deterioration of the compensation net for victims of accidents at work" and "the aid trend towards which the system is moving in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to give workers back the security afforded by insurance, because the fate of the victims of the accident cannot depend on the arbitraryness of the legislators and the distributive measures".
Hearing damage can be caused by MP3 players
The ability to listen to portable recording devices for longer and high volume, such as MP3 devices, can cause permanent hearing damage.
In its report published in Brussels, the European Commission, the Scientific Committee on New and Newly-identified Health Risks (SCENIHR), informed of the fact that it had issued an opinion today.
"The opinion shows that 5-10 percent of those who listen to their portable music player for more than an hour a day for five years can suffer permanent hearing loss" – can be read in the explanation.
"It is worrying that young people who use high-volume portable music players and mobile phones are not aware that they can cause irreversibly damage to their hearing" said Meglena Kuneva.
"Scientific surveys indicate an indisputable risk, which we must respond urgently", the EU Commissioner added.
The most important task is to inform consumers and disseminate information on this issue on a broad scale.
In the light of this opinion, we also need to review existing control systems so that they can function with the necessary efficiency and keep pace with the latest technologies".
Brussels asked the independent scientific committee to examine the problem in view of the prevalence of portable music players and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise caused by them.
"The researchers confirm that we have cause for concern, and the European Commission, in cooperation with the Member States and stakeholders, is ready to examine the possible measures to be taken to protect children and young people of the noise caused by portable players and similar means," said a member of the Committee.
The current European safety regulation sets the maximum level of noise emitted by portable music players in 100 dB, but there is growing concern that the hearing loss caused by the excessive use of such sound resources is reported.
At the same time, there are solutions, such as reducing the level and duration of noise pollution, which can significantly reduce these hearing impairments.
In the opinion of the EU Scientific Committee, it explains that those using portable player who listen to music with a high volume (more than 89 decibels) per week for five hours, noise noise exceeds the current maximum value for noise at work.
If a person listens to music under similar circumstances for a longer period of time, there is a risk of permanent hearing loss after five years.
This affects around 5-10 per cent of users of portable devices, which could mean 2.5-10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemno sets up the Committee for the Future of the Capital
It starts today, until March, results are expected in June.
This is the agenda for the operation of the Committee of the Capital of the capital of the capital of the capital of the capital of the capital of the capital of the capital of the capital of the capital of the capital of the capital of the capital of the capital of the city, which was meeting this morning at its new location behind the spa of the caracalla.
For the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up Rome's guidelines.
Following the final speech of March, the study and plans will be evaluated at the General Assembly and the municipal committee in order to be able to submit, in June, a strategic plan for cities officially approved by the Government and Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"This is a completely independent committee in which all kinds of political, social and cultural ideas are represented, and it is the task of Alemanno - to draw up proposals on the development ideas of Rome on which political decision-makers, namely the General Assembly and the Self-government Committee, can rely.
It is not a question of any conflict of interest; we just wanted a platform where great plans for the benefit of Rome could be created.
In March, after his work, the committee will be dissolved because he has a fixed-term mandate.
In June, we will present a strategic plan based on the work of the Committee on the Future of the capital city of Roma - the Prime Minister said.
To those who consider the Commission to be unnecessary, referring to the fact that the opinion it has put forward is not binding, Alemanno responds: "All depends on the Commission's work and the quality of the proposals it puts on the table.
If the quality is proven to be adequate, as in France, in the case of the Attali Committee, which I am sure of for Rome, the contribution it has given will have an important role to play.
The strength of politics is often shifted in day-to-day management and in the management of urgent cases that arise from time to time.
On the other hand, we look further away from the perspective and plan for a longer period of time and are committed to working towards the development and future of Rome".
The mayor of Rome intends to point out that "this Commission cannot be considered a useless "head of water", as it is completely free, it will not cost the citizens of Rome a euro, but it will be an inspiration for thought and the involvement of the best minds in the capital".
Alemno said that "there is a need for an open and flexible strategic framework that allows our city to jump in the quality that it would need so much, in a single spirit, to think about its future".
About the future on which the mayor of Rome stresses: 'not only will it be restricted to the current government frameworks, but it will look much further away', not only at the future metropolis and the capital status, but also at 'the role that Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean can play and must play'.
Obama, the first anti-American president, we'll show you why.
A well-known, independent American politician wrote about this: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
It was the first Jimmy Carter to destroy the American economy with his decisions and maintain close relations with the enemy Islam (as he is still a private man)".
As the time for the elections approaches, the attacks on Obama become more frequent.
A Miami lady wrote on the Internet, "This man is full of ambition.
Obama thinks that he can gain the highest public dignity of a nation with a total of two governors and five senators!"
These attacks are actually nothing; of course they are racist, but they do not answer the question of whether or not they will be a good president. Then there are the public polls: they indicate that Obama will win, and they will have a significant advantage.
In this case, there is one who listens to his feelings and not to his mind.
Within the southern states, a Mississippi newspaper wrote in its executive article: we know well that in the voting pool, it casts its vote on the real American patriot.
The American way of thinking appears here, which remains hidden until the last minute.
"Just talk what you want, and we'll know where we're going to put the X-ray, Obama or McCain."
Some people swear if Obama wins, they leave the United States.
Such words have never been said until now when the success of the black candidate is almost certain.
At the same time, despite all this cleverness, the democratics' winning weapon is George Bush.
1500 people were asked about the mistakes made during Bush's term of office? 89 percent said that Iraq.
America is changing.
This nation has lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam, and it's been billed to the bottom by flying home.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans didn't have to pack.
However, the majority believe Iraq was a weak point for Bush.
There's a huge task waiting for someone to replace George W.
The United States: the economic collapse is already felt by journalists, and the time has come in the editors too. Many blame the Internet for the 'death' of the printed press.
The PEW research institute asked five hundred American journalists how they feel about the future position and spiritual power of their profession.
Well, right now almost all journalists are pessimists about their own future.
However, it was not clearly stated that their concerns regarding authenticity would have diminished.
They don't feel as isolated as they used to be.
The problem with American journalists is money.
They believe that the 2008 crisis is a failure of a powerless economic model.
Another serious problem is the restrictions on newsrooms, i.e. newspaper - making editors.
If we do not want traditional journalism, in the sense of what is meant by the great public, to be reduced to a minimum, this problem needs to be solved - the journalists who have been asked say.
Today, it is clearly visible and complex pessimism that characterises American journalism.
Sixty percent of journalists and senior executives working in the press are convinced that national jurisprudence is on the wrong track.
On a local level, 65 percent of journalists are in senior management positions.
Printed versus electronic press.
The press staff will not find it difficult to see where the world network is going.
The biggest publishers are making their way to the Internet, which is considered by many to be the "murder" of the printed press.
The 'economic pressure' perceived by the journalists grew to 79 percent.
The 500 Asked Journalists acknowledged that they would vote for technology in the hope that it might be in the best interest of socialistism.
Today, in the American press sector, a gap lies between the editors, the directors, and the reporters who work for them.
At national level, 56% of managers are sure that their reporters share their information with others, while at local level this ratio can only be 23%.
Some people link this to a secure job.
At national level, 47% of drivers fear losing their jobs within three years.
In the case of journalists, this ratio is 30 per cent.
In America, the question of "secure work" is constantly on the agenda at team level (in the case of our editors).
Only 13 percent of journalists have contracts.
For a large nation like the United States of America with 300 million inhabitants, where thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, television and Internet service providers work, employers usually recommend as much as they want, so it works on the basis of "must or not".
The directors usually receive a high salary, while the editors can make ten thousand dollars a month in addition to the pension and health insurance premiums.
Freedom, on the other hand, is a rather complex principle: in the first year, x day, in the third year, as well as until after a certain period, it reaches the maximum of 15 days.
But U.S. journalists, according to their own statement, often "be sick" throughout the year.
It's all about the climate.
UNIPOL: THE ROOM: DANILO COPPOLA GROOTAFERRATABAN MARAD
Carmelo Rinaudo, President of the Second Criminal Session of the Roman Court of Justice, rejected the application of Danilo Coppola, who wanted to visit a Roman apartment from his place of residence, Grottaferrata.
Coppola is conducting an economic bankruptcy investigation in the context of the Unipol - BNL Share Exchange Agreement.
Last week, during the proceedings against him, house arrest was released and it was turned into a residence ban for Grottaferrata.
Her lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, requested that the real estate specialist be able to visit the town of small rural town.
However, according to the Court, these influxes (for which the prosecutor proposed a rejection) would allow the company to influence and access the evidence it has brought against them.
The elite in danger
The phenomenon was felt a few days ago when the House of Representatives did not vote on the $700 billion rescue package presented by the White House: a significant proportion of Americans were more interested and still interested in the punishment of Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday's New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis has led to a break within the Republican Party, which is showing an increasing division between the traditional, repressive Eastern coastline that supports federal institutions and business circles and the emerging anti- Washington and financial world direction in central and southern states.
This trend has been critical in the House vote referred to in the introduction.
However, this event is only one of the major changes that the economic restructuring that is still taking place in the United States has indicated or allowed foregone, not only in the United States, but also in the whole Western world, perhaps beyond.
It seems that the crisis, both in the US and in Europe, has only speeded up for a long time the palpable phenomena that have been solidified in this new atmosphere and are finally being brought to light.
The first such phenomenon is the re-actulation, the return of the dual category of state sovereignty to the public, the renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis is affecting banking institutions that have close links with abroad, but primarily and fairly widely, they are bringing together people and families who live in a single country, a state.
This, however, is a direct political challenge for those in the government: what to respond to the difficulties and protests of people who are also electors.
Therefore, the crisis appears to be global in economic terms, but in political terms almost exclusively national.
It appears that political internationalism is essentially outside the coast: it is evidenced by the European Union, which is not able to define a uniform political direction, based on different interests and different national strategies.
So everyone expects the intervention, the rescue package, the recovery and the new rules, especially the opening of funds, from individual national governments: because in a situation where there is a need, only individual states have economic resources, a financial stock that can make things right.
They also have the tools and the mandate to use them: they have, under certain circumstances, two invaluable resources with which no other market and no international organisation will ever have such resources.
On the other hand, the new emphasis placed on the nation state by the crisis is fully consistent with the fact that the economic growth that has taken place in recent times places increasing importance on a factor that is closely linked to this element: that is territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the abstract world of the network, the increasingly sophisticated technology, and we were convinced that the global financial world was destined to dominate the world, we just had to notice that our future was increasingly dependent on things that were not least abstracted, such as water, crops and oil.
Things that can be transported from one side of the planet to another can still be linked to an entirely surrounded area, an area.
So he who controls the area has a lot more bat cards than he who was born for his misfortune in a place where there is no crop, no oil and no water.
I would also turn to the second novelty, which suggests a kind of break-in line.
Anyone who says it's an area, a state, a government, and if necessary, he says it's politics, in other words, driving.
In this respect, it appears that the economic crisis is producing two alarming phenomena:
On the one hand, the objective recognition of the need for credible leadership is for someone who can handle events.
On the other hand, the current management, in particular the total loss of credit to economic leaders, who have proven themselves completely unfit and have proven that much remains to be a blurry area.
Together, the two are even more profound and, in some respects, more alarming: the feeling of loss of credit, impatientness, inability and isolation, which affects the entire leadership body in more and more Western countries.
It seems, therefore, that the public is becoming increasingly convinced that the social elite's time so far is over. It has expired even before their actions, their experiences, their way of life, their culture, in the sense of the word complex, and that the social elite is increasingly alienated from the opinion of the majority.
In short, the need for leadership, in the form of a comprehensive but strong delegation movement against the ruling group and the traditional political system. This is reflected in recent sudden changes in the public voice, such as the way the conservatives gain power in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of the labour force in Great Britain or the rebellion of American Congressmen Bush (and perhaps the victory of the Italian right).
It seems that the traditional elite, with its parties, programmes, and even it could be said that with its traditions, press and famous intellectuals, it is becoming less and less understood and therefore less able to represent what has been happening for some time in the deeper layers of Western society.
Nevertheless, speaking of "the near-up rebellion of the masses" would be an overstatement, to be honest.
But keeping an open eye wouldn't hurt at all.
We can walk on the wall with super powerful glue.
A superpowered glue can help you defeat gravity and walk on the wall like Spider-Man.
This goal was set out by several American research centres, and a group of four institutions is close to finding a solution.
With just 2.5 centimeters of glue, researchers managed to glue a body of 100 kg to a vertical wall and keep it there.
THE U.S. magazine JAULMÁNY - A.S. published the discoveries of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the scientific group was born from the development of specific, so-called carbon nanotube materials that already existed.
"The operating principle of the glue should be imagined as a package of pipe systems similar to spaghetti," says Zhong Lin Wang, researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the Atlantic.
The researchers drew the idea from the foot of the gecko with microscopic blinds, which gives the animal the perfect grip.
Tests with different materials, such as glass, teflon and polishing paper, have confirmed that the new glue is ten times more effective than the feet of these reptiles, while "slightly dislodged", explains Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
FALON Walk? - "This material can be useful as a temporary glue" - add Liming Dai.
Can we walk on the wall, just like Spider-Man? Maybe, but researchers think about a less impressive use than connecting electronic devices, because coal nanotubes are a good source of heat and electricity.
You can find more applications in space research.
The superheroes can still wait.
OTHER COURSE - the University of Berkeley, California, is also conducting experiments with a new glue.
According to the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian scientists presented a hair --style, microfiber glue that undergoes self - cleansing during the movement of the surface, thus providing a perfect grip.
No fruit juice.
Care must be taken with grapefruits, oranges and apples.
These high-vitaminised, mainly in the summer, thirsting drinks, when taken in combination with certain life-saving medicines, change their absorption, when strengthened or reduced, as appropriate. This may have serious health consequences.
David Bailey, Professor of the University of Western Ontario, drew attention to the risks of the combination of canned or fresh fruit juices and certain medicines. At the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, the professor announced: a glass of Grapefruit, Orange or Apple can reduce the absorption of certain life-saving drugs, thereby preventing their beneficial effects and putting the patient’s health at risk.
Grapefruit juice was already on the defendant's bench when it turned out that it was able to enhance the effects of some antibiotics, antihistamines, anxiety suppressors, heart rhythm control and neurodrugs to a toxic level.
COORDINATED MEDICINAL PRODUCTS - Two years ago, the Italian Institute of Medicine published the news in its official publication and warned doctors and patients to take seriously the risks associated with such co-administration and to pay attention to what they drink when taking medicines such as Diazepam or Metadon.
GRAPEFRUIT - According to researchers, orange and apple juice also contains substances that inhibit the effectiveness of medicines.
A long list of active substances whose absorption is restricted by grapefruit and other fruit juices could be classified as long as possible.
This is what Michele Carruba, professor of the State Department of Medicine of the University of Milan, draws attention to: "In general, such discoveries are immediately reported to the various national and international pharmaceutical agencies, who, if necessary, will ensure that the information contained in the information on the medicinal product concerned is changed.
That is why you should always read the information on the medicine you want to take, and if something is not understandable, let us not allow ourselves to be influenced, but let us clearly ask our doctor or pharmacist", the specialist at the Ana Institute stressed.
Paul Krugman received the Nobel Prize for the Economy
The U.S. Paul Krugman received the Nobel Prize for analysing trade models and the territorial context of economic activity.
The 55-year-old Neokeynesian Krugman is teaching at Princeton University, and is a well-known publicist of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the greatest critics of the economic and foreign policy measures of the Bush government.
A few months after the terrorist attack in September 2001, Krugman announced in his executive article in the New York Times that the latest event would have more decisive consequences for the history of the United States than the collapse of the twin towers.
This forecast was not a small debate, but we know today that it was accurate.
"I'm surprised, and I'm a little shocked how quickly the scandalous collapse of Enron or Worldcom has gone beyond public interest" said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "very valuable economist", while "distributes rather aggressive criticisms of the Bush government's excessive liberalism".
Open Office, the third edition of the Anti-Microsoft Package is worth it
Today, the open program-code application package, which increases the productivity of OpenOffice.org 3.0, aims at increasing layers as a free alternative to Microsoft Office, from home to office users, from free-to-air users to administrations.
After almost one year of work carried out by SUN Microsystem and by voluntary developers, the new Open Office will take a number of new developments to the general public: outside the welcome screen and the re-thinking less spartan user interface, there are several important innovations. For example, the compatibility with the Apple Mac OS X operating system and supports the new ISO standard ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format.
Particular attention has been paid to the compatibility with the Office 2007 system, so Open Office can open new Microsoft documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
An interesting feature of some modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint displays. This can be useful when sending files by email. Another feature supports the import of PDF files into the graphical module by keeping the site layout.
At the same time, we can create "hybrid PDF" documents on this interface, which combines the usual Adobe format with the table manager or text editor elements.
Sharing within applications has also been through a number of developments: the tabular manager supports the joint use of workbooks, but prevents duplication of each other's work. Each member's comment is marked by a different color, which helps to make it easier to identify at the inspection stage.
Some companies are already working to make OpenOffice's functions available from the Internet (on the cloud), so the final version may be presented in the coming weeks.
The Italian version, which has been added to the English version since Friday, can be downloaded from http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0/download300.html
The program package is also available for Linux in addition to normal Windows and Mac OS operating systems.
On request, we can take over the installation CD either at home or at work.
In terms of the spread of home application, freeness is probably the greatest attraction, but the Open Office program package is now trying to kick you into the business sector as it can count on a number of administrative and school projects.
Ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises is not missing educational, advisory and service services, which can open up new business perspectives.
The Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, text editor according to Word; Calc, a table manager to replace Excel; Impress, Powerpoint presentations; Dbase is the most well-known Access database manager; and finally Draw is the graphical module.
The 2008 target is 5 million downloads. However, if we consider that the new version is already at 3.600,000, this number will probably be higher than expected.
Kohl's result is positive, it's the fourth doping case.
At the last stage of the Tour de France, another positive sample was produced by one of the participants, the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, who competed in the Gerolsteiner team, who also won the best mountain-breeding trico in addition to the Bronze medal.
The news is that you've seen the sun on the Web site of Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth racer, Riccardo Riccicz and Leonardo Piepol, Italy, and also the German Gerolsteiner contestant Stefan Schumacher, who produced a positive Cera test for the third generation version of EPO.
The blood samples of Kohl, as in the last few weeks, were tested by the laboratories in Lauanne and Chatenay-malabry.
If the control tests confirm the positive result of Cera, Austria will lose its third place and will be prohibited from competing for two years as required.
The report on the positive results of the Third Generation EPO test was also confirmed by Pierre Bordry, the head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, and reported to the Associated Press News Agency that he signaled positive doping results to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrians were able to stand behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, and they also won the top-notch trick.
BETTERS: Does NEW YORK CREATE A CALL, A CROSS OF ITALY?
The country of immigrants in Italy has only recently become one of the most popular targets for those who are reluctantly admitted.
That's why Belpaese is turning into a racist nation? That's what the New York Times is all about, starting from the case of Abdul William Guibre, a young Burkina Faso, who was murdered last month in Milan because he stole a box of biscuits - devoted to a long article about racism in Italy.
The case is well characterised by what the New York Times calls the 'scientific paradox': in the northern regions, 'the strongest is integration and the highest is employment', at the same time, 'the anti-migration and the support of the Northern League' is the strongest in the country.
In order to support the increasing tension between the Italians and immigrants, NYT also quotes cases in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
In fact.
The new laws required by the League, which would make the lawns closer to immigration and facilitate the deportation of illegal immigrants, have been set as an example of mood change in Italy.
This trend is also highlighted by the pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano met with XVI Benede at the Quirinale Palace and raised the need for the State and the Church to cooperate to combat racism".
Students are suffering from expensive rents, with up to 900 euros in a room
The market for accommodation granted to university students is not affected by the crisis.
According to the latest survey by the Sunia, the Association of Housing Rentals, a student can pay up to 900 euros for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has already been incredibly large sizes, which, due to the overall cost of families, closes the broad layers of students from the possibility of learning," explains Laura Mariani, the head of the Sunia's study office. "In these cities, the high demand of students has distorted the market to such an extent that a general process of costing has also started against local residents."
In the majority of cases, real estate offers also include a number of irregularities: contracts not registered, not subject to lease restrictions, linked to leases.
According to Sunia, exceptional measures would be needed to maximise prices by reviewing the tax system.
The details of the survey show that in Milan, around Brianza, a single bed is also charged EUR 450; the price of the single room is from EUR 650 (Bande Nere area) to an average of EUR 800 ( Lambiate, Udine and Fiera), but can also reach EUR 900 (Vittoria area).
In Florence, one bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room costs about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where most of the students live near the university, a single bed costs 250/280 euros if it is double and 370-500 euros if it is a single room.
In Rome, in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) about EUR 600 is charged for a single and 450 beds in a double room.
A little cheaper (550 Euros per single room) prices around other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can save everything in suburban districts: 300 euros in a bed and 450 in a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar districts.
In Naples, they charge 300/450 euros for a bed, from 400 to 600 euros for a room. The highest price is in the vicinity of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
Bari has to pay 250/350 euros for a bed and at least 350 euros for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they represent greater weight within the city budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where non-EU students are often looking for accommodation, there is another disorder: rents from foreign students are about 25-30 percent higher than for Italian tenants.
Farewell old Cinema Paradiso, the cities sacrificed the time of the old cinemas
Traditional cinemas close for the Multiplexes.
"A city with no cinemas, blind city, like a face without eyes."
The images taken by director Giuseppe Tornatore are effective in presenting everything that takes place in Italian cities, but also in rural areas.
The expropriation of cinemas - the appearance of large multi-term cinemas in the suburbs, and as a result the dispersal of mono-territorial ones in the city centres - is an inevitable and irreversible process, but at the same time it has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime on its own.
When places of history and memory are gone, "it's like a friend is going away, a friend with whom we shared our journey and many experiences," says the director of Cinema Paradiso. The film, which, 20 years ago, presented Oscar's award and the grand prize of the Cannes Festival, tells the story of a small-town cinema in lira, after a movie experience that may have been lost forever.
The largest association of operators, the data reported by Anec, is clear: over the last five years 316 traditional cinemas were closed. The biggest loss could be recorded by cinemas in large cities: 10 cinemas closed in Florence, 9 Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 Turin and 5 Palermo.
Emilia-Romagna, one of the most affected regions, lost 82 cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardia (41).
And that, for their disappearance, it is the spatial acquisition of multiplexes that is responsible for nothing more than Italy's highest number of newly opened multi-sale cinemas in these three regions: the number of rooms has increased by 195 in Lombardia, 81 in Tuscany and the same number in Emilia-Romagna in the last five years.
"The number of units in Italy has increased irrationally," says Paolo Protti, President of Anec. "It is clear that we are building new facilities, but the survival of those already existing should also be ensured, because when an urban cinema is closed, not all people are willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention the outstanding financial funds intended to support operators, the state’s debt is estimated to amount to around EUR 10 million.
From an ethical and moral point of view, it is shameful that the government does not comply with the legislation in force.
To maintain the market, €16-18 million a year would be needed".
This is the first Italian city that has decided, in its concerns about closures, to remedy the problem by means of an agreement between the municipality and Anec in order to protect and boost one-room cinemas abroad and downtown.
The provisions would include tax advantages for operators and benefits for the public to promote accessibility: viewers can park in restricted zones and in certain parking spaces with a preferential tariff.
"I like this initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore - and I hope that other cities will also be followed by other measures, including other measures, but will follow the example of Bologna.
However, it is also certain that traditional cinemas will need to improve sound and image quality in order to be able to fight multiplexed, because today's audience is much more demanding.
Protecting the traditional cinema was always an important question for me: the closure of the Supercinema in Bagheria - where I spent my childhood and my youth - gave me that spark, which is why I finally did Cinema Paradiso, even though I thought about it for 10 years.
I've been living in Rome for 25 years, so when I go to Via Nazionale in front of the closed Rialto or Quirinale, so I don't see the dust-black posters, I'd rather turn my head around.
Close links between politics and the 'andrangheta, arrested Mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro supported the interests of the Piromodel clan in the municipal decisions."
Serious accusations have been made against the President and Vice-Chairman of the California Mafia Directorate, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and against Carlo Martelli, Mayor of Rosarno, who were arrested this morning for the charge of external participation in the crime co-operation.
Clinked to the hands of Gioacchino Piromodel, a senior broker between the clan and the public administration, as well as a nephew of a lawyer named the same name as the boss, who had previously been convicted of participating in a mafia-like crime co-operation and had a compensation of EUR 10 million.
"The lack of any legal and moral rule, more than that of good taste, is written by state prosecutors. The two local authorities have expressed their intention to pay an advisory fee to Piromodel's lawyer.
"So the clan would have officially had access to the town hall, which would have provided an additional opportunity to control and manage the administration, which can already be said to be significant.
Agazio Loiero, President of the General Assembly of the Catalan Region, does not hide that there is a "number of matches between the local institutions and the organized underworld": There are areas where the spread of the mafia is stronger than elsewhere, where it is almost inevitable to collide.
Many local politicians, however, resist the pressure of 'andrangheta', are the heroes who remain clean.
This morning's arrests are the continuations of the July events, when the police announced that they were able to decapitate the Piromodel clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were relieved of their mandate to manage the municipality. Gioia Tauro's municipal committee was dissolved once in 1991 because of the alleged mergers between organised crime and local government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the newly-regulated Christian Democrat Mayor at the time of disintegration, was put at the head of the right-most coalition in the second round of 2006.
He called out a scandal when the County Hall ordered the separation of the municipal committee.
He referred Marco Minini, then Deputy Minister of Interior, to the Court for Political Purpose. However, the court stated in the arrest warrant signed this morning that he had ventured up to the Piromodel clan to demand a change in project A3.
The hearing with Dal Torriona shows that the state prosecutors "was inclined to meet the demands of an entrepreneur who was known to be close to the Piromodel family, to subdue the decisions of the government to clan interests."
The energy comes from the waves, and now the big ones are coming.
An inexhaustible source of energy that accounts for 70 percent of the planet's surface, and which is still being discovered by large international energy companies
Waves, sea currents, floods, all renewable energy sources that have been cast into the eyes of giants like Chevron, who are now trying to put their hands on them.
For hundreds of years they have been searching for ways to gain energy from sea movements. In the '70s, during the first oil crisis, research increased.
Around 1980, when oil prices fell, the idea of using marine energy has been discarded, but today the new rise in environmental demands and oil prices has given new impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London estimates in 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by marine wave-exploitation facilities.
This quantity is twice what nuclear power plants are currently producing.
In addition, the currents and the current would still be there.
The giants are in motion.
Enersis was the first company to commit to maritime energy and signed an agreement in 2005 on a power plant in Northern Portugal.
It seemed like a revolutionary move when the signature was announced.
Two years have passed since, and more and more companies are taking part in marine energy, including those who have so far been committed to supporting traditional energy.
"Chevron studies the energy-using technologies of the oceans and considers the possibility of cooperation with us," said a spokesperson of one of the American oil giants' associated companies, Wall Street Journal.
The cooperation in question concerns the authorisation to launch the Alaskan project for the exploitation of marine energy issued by the US Energy Committee.
This is not a small matter, especially when we consider that the USA is in Alaska, and even President Bush has recently launched a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc., New York City and Ocean Power, are the way out of the sea. The amounts invested so far, as far as you can see from the details, are evidence of increasing interest.
The technology is waiting to be developed.
According to experts, it is still a matter of initial technology, only because the energy from the sea does not dispel any doubts about the environmental impact.
All existing facilities such as Portugal or Scotland are small and therefore there is no too much problem with the ecosystem.
However, in order to produce more energy, we need facilities with a greater environmental impact.
There are several options: Ocean Power, for example, uses a connected boja system.
The shocks generated by waves and moving the bushes up and down are turned into hydraulic pressure by the plungers and cylinders in them.
The pressure is rolling a turbine that feeds a generator.
The electric current goes to the ground on the cables under the sea.
There are four similar types of facilities in the design phase, which are only waiting for federal permission. Some of the energy produced would be used in a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, has already started producing energy for a shopping mall and a parking lot using six submarine turbines in the East River in New York.
At the time of the current, the water movement will turn the turbines into shovels, and this rotation will feed the generator.
Verdant said that he had a long list of partners waiting only for permission to use energy.
It's flooding after waves.
Currently, special attention is needed to exploit the potential of the flood.
Although it is a periodic phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun or waves, therefore it is considered a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine and Alaska, along with the other coastal states, spent $7.5 million in 2008, making use of the energy provided by the flood, which is expected to increase to 35 million in 2009.
