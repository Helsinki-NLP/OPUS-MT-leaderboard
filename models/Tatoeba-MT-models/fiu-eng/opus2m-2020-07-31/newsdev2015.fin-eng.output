Change in business support practices - Region - Regions - News - Karjalainen
In addition to EU business subsidies, the management of national business subsidies will be concentrated in four Ely Centres from mid-September onwards.
In Eastern Finland, the Ely Centre of Southern Savo is responsible for its activities in Mikkeli.
Under the new Act on State Aid for Enterprises, which entered into force at the beginning of July, EU Structural Funds may no longer be allocated to large enterprises unless it is a whole new operation.
The subsidiaries of municipalities with over five thousand inhabitants are also considered to be great honors.
On the other hand, EU support can continue to be available for investments to improve the business conditions of municipalities.
In Eastern Finland, the EU and national grant management unit will be strengthened by about 30 people.
For the time being, all of them will continue to work in their current offices.
For example, Kalevi Pölönen, Head of the Structural Funds Unit of the Ely Centre in Southern Savo, is working in Joensuu.
Researcher: This is what Russia is trying to do now in Ukraine
Russia acts consistently, even if it does not always appear to be.
Head of the National Defence College Strategy Department, Colonel, Docent Torsti Siren was not surprised by the conflicting news from Ukraine on Monday morning.
This has been the same for a long time, siren says.
On the other hand, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for an immediate ceasefire and announced that Russia would not attack Ukraine (read more here).
On the other hand, Ukraine reports that its paratrooper forces are currently fighting with the Russian tank department near Luhansk Airport, and that the tank department has received confirmations (read more here).
Mr Lavrov called for an immediate ceasefire in the Minsk negotiations without conditions.
Russia denies its involvement and immediately needs to be brought to a close with the outcome of the negotiations in order to give them their established status in Luhansk and Donetsk.
That's the whole thing, Siren says.
This is the big pattern: we must quickly start negotiating and precisely so that Russia can take its own hold in the Luhanski and Donetsk regions.
Finnair externalizes passenger services for a Norwegian company, vacations people
Finnair begins to purchase cabin services as a subcontractor from the Norwegian crew service company OSM Aviation.
The agreement concerns the routes of Finnair to Hong Kong and Singapore, but it is expected to be extended at a later stage.
The appearance of the two routes results in a total reduction of about 100 staff years in Finland, which takes place at the first stage on holiday holidays, the company reported in its bulletin.
In addition, some 80 Asian temporary workers will be out of work at the time the routes are out.
Finnair already told us in June that it intends to outsource about 20 routes of passenger services over the next two years.
When no agreement was reached with the staff on savings was reached, they ended up in the fields.
Outputs are scheduled to start next year in January-March.
According to the company, negotiations on cooperation will also continue with other partners.
According to the study, sleep problems multiply the risk of nerve-related back pain, or pain in the sciatic pain, by those who work hard in shifts.
The occupational health department survey followed firefighters for 13 years.
The association of sleep disorders with the schizophrenic tree is surprisingly strong, although many other factors were taken into account.
Good muscle strength and durability of firemen, which are regularly tested, do not seem to protect from pain, says the research director, Docent Sirpa Lusa in the Institute's press release.
Firemen's work is irregular shift work, where shifts can stretch for up to 24 hours.
According to the occupational health service, sleep problems are common in this type of work.
The results are based on a survey carried out in 1996, 1999 and 2009.
Do you know the surprising new causes of water damage?
They are easy to cause damage to other apartments
Water damage Water damage is not always caused by leaking pipes or taps, reminds the host association expert.
We have been contacted when the breakage of the aquarium has caused water damage in the building company to make it possible to ban the aquariums, says Marina Furuhjelm, legal expert at the Association of Hosts.
Furuhjelm points out that not only are pipes and sewers the common cause of water damage, but now also more and more new machinery such as ice-reflecting machines have caused water leakage in housing.
Many people do not know that machines such as a washing machine or a washing machine should not be left unattended.
The water tap shall also be kept closed whenever the machine is not on, as the pressure in the pipe may lead to a leak.
A resident may be regarded as guilty of negligence if these obligations have been neglected, in which case the person is liable for the damage.
Of course, in these cases home insurance may make good the damage, depending on the conditions and case of the insurance.
If it can be demonstrated that the resident has caused the damage caused by negligence, the resident will be liable.
If the person has passed out on the floor well, the neglect can often be demonstrated because, in these cases, the water is flooded elsewhere and the caretaker comes to the apartment where the person who has passed out is located.
Furuhjelm says that due to the generalisation of the discharge of the floor wells, many student housings have now been fitted with two floor wells in the shower rooms.
Water damage has also been caused by water beds, though no longer to the extent that they were more popular.
Even the dog’s water cup and the home wine can become real water damage.
I also know that there were many cats in the apartment that had peed on the floors so much damage came to the floor, Furuhjelm says.
The principle of responsibility always goes the same if the company’s statutes do not provide otherwise.
The shareholder is responsible for repairing the surface material and for damage to the structure of the building company and damage to other dwellings.
Water damage can easily cause damage to other homes because the structure of concrete absorbs water very easily.
According to Furuhjelm, house battery leaks are particularly difficult because the batteries are easily leaked into secret structures.
Water damage can be caused by today’s generalised air - temperature pumps that produce condensed water.
Water should lead to a solid sewage or rainwater network, not just a container.
The shareholder also has the responsibility to remove water, snow, ice and garbage from the balcony, the legal expert advises.
Furuhjelm states that, although the rules of the building company do not require, for example, a flat-rate removal of the washing machine, the insurance may be subject to a condition which, for that reason, leaves the compensation unsubstantiated.
You should be careful with your own home insurance policy.
However, I consider the loose, e.g. water drains in the tub, to be a high risk, which has caused many damage.
I would recommend that the effluents should always be led firmly into the sewage drain.
Snow and water removal with balcony
Control of washing machines, dishwashers, etc., while on.
Sealing of water taps (washing machine and dishwasher)
The cleaning of the floor well appears to be twice per six months.
It is recommended that the waste water should be firmly connected to the waste water.
Check the handles and possible leakages
Regular defrosting of freezer

FC Honka lost again and poured into a show.
On Sunday night, at Tapiola Sports Park, two of the weakest teams of this moment met the gymnastics of the Fleet League.
In June, FC Honka, the last winner of the victory, hosted seven games in a non-profitable tube by the Watch Tower Ball Society.
VPS just took over Honka in July.
Sunday’s meeting with the Seine Team came into a good wand, as the VPS returned to the profit margin for a long time, reading 2-1.
Before the game Olli Huttinen, the main coach of the whales, complained about the inefficiency of his team, but the confused Honka defense made it easier for VPS to paint.
Gameful very nervous performance.
We didn't get any longer attacks at all, we didn't get to hold the ball," Huttunen evaluates his own performance.
In the first half of the time, Honga’s top-notch, Milos Milovic - Kosta Manev played in a very uncertain way.
Both whale paints were produced as a result of the loose play of the cappers.
The opening painting was seen only after five minutes of the game, when Steven Morrissey directed the launch of Sebastian Strandvall by the fooled Honka painter Walter Viital.
It's a shame for the first half.
By the field, the team did the opposite of what was agreed before the game", Honga's head coach Shefki Kuqi mani.
After the initial shock, the Seines got their game together and rolled the ball at the head of the attack.
Especially the midfield player Carlos Portela and the sleigher Roni Porokara eagerly sought artificial sites, but the last solutions were almost repetitive.
The nearest goal was the Honga Central Fieldman Jussi Vasara, whose 20-metre shot, however, was slightly past the VPS paint.
VPS was effective in attacking against using its whimsical attackers and Honga's confusing top-lipper.
At half an hour, the vases made a 2-0, when Morrissey and Cornelius Stewart got in two straight lines.
Morrissey served and Stewart finished.
Morrissey was on a good gamehead during the opening session and repeatedly created situations from the left side.
The speed of Stewart, again, seemed to be too much for the parasitic defense throughout the game.
"In half time, if you lose, you lose with honor," Kuqi told me.
Encrusted Honka applied in the second period for a fiercely narrowing paint.
The team was twice close to the hit until the third company succeeded.
Set up Yerai Vilaboa finished the goal in the middle of the penalty zone.
After the Vilaboa goal, Honga had half an hour to balance the match.
The Espolainen team continued to take more and more risks, giving VPS the opportunity to take dangerous counterattacks.
Both Stewart and Morrissey were able to get along with Viitala, but the Honka painter's twilights kept up with the home team.
At the end, Honka was a little short, and he couldn't get any more goals.
With the loss, Honka was the last one to cast the Struggle League while there are seven more games left.
Newspaper: Putin threatened to conquer Kiev in two weeks
Russian President Vladimir Putin was quite loud in his telephone conversation with the EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, reports the Italian newspaper La Repubblica.
Putin expressed his frustration at the plans of the European Union to tighten up sanctions against Russia.
If I want to, I can take Kiev for two weeks, La Repubblica tells me Putin said.
According to the paper, Putin's message to Barroso was this: it is not worth annoying Russia with new sanctions.
Putin gave Russian TV's first channel an interview about Ukraine's crisis on Sunday night.
During the interview, Putin said that he would hold the conflict entirely within Ukraine and that he would urge the Kiev government to negotiate directly with the rebels.
At the same time, he warned Kiev very much about the shooting of civilian targets in Eastern Ukraine.
Russia's "can't watch next door" if people are shot to death at close range, Putin said.
Esko Roine confesses: The work of the actor destroyed the family
The hard work of the Conkarian actor and the theatre family grew up to confess how the actor’s profession destroyed his first marriage.
Actress Esko Roine will be 70 next Friday, but I think he has a valid saying that age is just a number.
I don't see any difference compared to one year ago or two years ago or ten years ago.
The mental puberty seems to continue, says Esko Roine.
Roine's been retired for years, but she's still working for a lot of men.
Sometimes it was a joke that there were not many plays in this country without Esko Roinet.
At the moment, Roine has the roles in the Helsinki City Theatre's play How to succeed in business life, in the Tampere Workers' Theatre's Inflammation and in the Tampere Comedy Theatre's Quartet.
Roine is also seen in the future Risto Rapper film.
PHOTO: Reijo Hietanen
The roiine actor's career didn't start promisingly.
I didn't have enough time for a Tiernaboy photo at school.
40-50 years later, the teacher said it was because I was so bad.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
The career choice was clear. There was no choice.
It seemed close and loving.
I was so busy in the field that I quit school and went to the army as a volunteer just to get to the theatre school as soon as possible.
Roine has done about 200 theater roles and 300 TV shows, depending on how you calculate.
If you count jobs like the English manikins, that every part of the TV series is your own show, then there are over 600 TV cases.
After all, I spent three years in a new day that was made three episodes a week.
The other spring I was killed there when I didn't have time to do it.
Commitments for autumn 2016
Esko's great sisters Eila, 83, and Liisa, 76, are in full attack and are doing the wild roles as anarchist mummies in Tampere's Worker Theatre.
My little brother's gonna be swinging his hips for years.
That's what it looks like now, but you don't know about this age.
I always have to take a little reservation so I can come if I'm alive.
Some commitments have been made or promised.
Calendar has reservations for autumn 2016.
They've been leaving a man behind for years, too.
And you're not coming alone.
The knees are operated, the hips are whistled and the joint fractures are bothering, but when you don't let it get too upset, you'll find out if Roine says so.
For the TV audience, Roine became familiar, for example.
From the pirate radio and a sketch of Antti Einio, he shared hundreds of dollars in bills.
It was Antti Einio who divided the crops.
I was trying to make sure they were hundreds and not crops.
In the Reinikainen series, Roine was a vain Lieutenant Rautakallion.
He became Tampere policemen's favorite in the department when he happened to be working on the same kind of lieutenant.
A cop stopped the car on the street, took the window open and shouted to me, "It's a great Ironfall!"
Successful working group
Some of the theatres Roeie's memories have been left behind.
Producer and Master Class of the City Theatre of Helsinki, the death of the Trade Passenger of Tampere Workers Theatre and the long day of Tampere Theatre.
It all comes down to the fact that the performances have been popular.
It's not because of me. It's because the working party has succeeded.
There's been a series of rheumatisms, too.
The role of Pekka Woodhead in the film is one of them.
There are others.
It's because I've agreed too easily.
I don't know if I regret those roles, but the outcome isn't self-satisfied or satisfying the audiences.
As a line actor, you can't choose your own job.
It's just done nicely, you know, what you've been told.
In addition to the theatre work, Roine has also tried to succeed in business.
In the '80s, he had a restaurant called Wanhat Roomeot in Tampere.
It was a teaching experience.
It was nothing when I tried to be the manager of Tampere Theatre at the same time, an actor and then a food designer.
If I remember correctly, within a year, it became clear that they should not be aligned in any way.
The typical thing was that when the show was finished or between hours and I was already wondering if I'd put on the sauna, the restaurant became a call about your friends hoping to see you after the show.
Memories for Birthday
On his birthday, Esko Roine's memoirs will appear, as ghost writers Annika Grahn and Eija Mäkinen.
Some sort of convex they've created from the imagery of the face-wrecker.
At one point in Zoom, when I played, I was called a face-wrecker.
They didn't know me by name.
The book has been made for years.
In the past, Roine told me that there was no news bomb on the list, because she didn't do anything so rough, or if she did, she wouldn't tell me.
I made a small opening phrase in the book.
In it, I say that if someone is waiting for scandalous revelations or good gossip, you should stop reading this.
There's quite a lot of work involved, as an actor, as a theatre director.
The publisher also notes that there is competition from the crazy theatre school time.
It was quite a normal student life, but it was a complete trick to be done as a kid.
It wasn't as wild as Turka's.
It was very different.
I don't know how much I got there but confidence that when school is done, it's not gonna be up to it if things don't heal.
I didn't have to think how good I would be if I went to school.
Roine also remembers the legends of the National Theatre.
I became friends with Pentti Siimes, Tarmo Mann and Hannes Haryrinen, and I was able to work with them.
There were legends there from my first father-in-law, Kaarlo Haltus.
Pia Hattara and I had a very close relationship.
Tauno Palo was already gone, but I had time to get to know him at school.
The middle son of the fire, Martti, was with me on the same course.
At the theatre school, Roine met her first wife, Marjukka Halttusen.
As a painful matter, he remembers his divorce.
After a relatively long battle, the children were divided.
Not for two parts, but for the daughter to the mother and the son to me.
I did not think it was a good solution, and I understand that children are quite the same now as adults.
In theatre circles, it's not uncommon for people to divide silver.
In a case like us, some part of it was that I was working quite a lot back then.
I was in the theater almost every case.
Then there was a TV and a radio on it.
I did a long day and my family was suffering.
Maybe a night off on the day of the party.
Esko Roine celebrates the Tampere Worker Theatre at the Parade of Mind on 7 September.
The festival will continue at the Helsinki City Theatre on 21 and 28 September.
The mind-responsor's going to gloat there, too.
I was 50 when I was at work. I was 60 when I was at work.
When such an easy - moving play happened, I thought we'd take the 70s and get them out with one rhythm.
According to Roja, there's no party service for a real birthday.
I think it's a free night, but I'm not going to swear.
I may have done some work for that day.
Or maybe it's a weird night off that I'm going to have the night off, Roine says.
Aviation industry concerns about the production chain
Some of the smaller UK aircraft manufacturers are concerned that the manufacturing capacity problems in the supply chain may hamper the ambitious plans of large aircraft manufacturers to increase the production of passenger aircraft.
In the UK, thousands of companies in the aircraft manufacturing chain enjoy the unexpected large number of aircraft and engine development plans that are currently being carried out simultaneously.
Aviation and defence
At the same time as some enjoy the order intake, warnings have been issued about the capacity problems and price pressure at the production chain.
"It is absolutely true that there is a price pressure, especially now that production volume poses challenges," says Craig Gallagher, Director-General of MB Aerospace, one of the main suppliers of aircraft engines such as Rolls-Royce.
According to David Bailey, the CEO of the North West Aerospace Alliance, representing about 240 North-West England's aircraft production suppliers, there is a need for more capacity.
"Do strategies and investment plans respond to these growth plans?
To tell you the truth, I'm not quite sure about that.
Above all, we need more investment in new production equipment and machinery, which are needed to achieve these production volumes," Gallagher says.
According to some companies, the simultaneous implementation of new production plans and the increase in aircraft building are part of the problem.
According to Andrew Churchill, the CEO of JJ Chrurchilli, producing the wings of gas turbines, the company has a 'exploiting time' when several new construction plans began to be implemented at the same time at the beginning of the year.
In short, we moved from very little production to a state where production capacity was exceeded.
Many orders were only paid afterwards, and we also had to try to tighten up.
However, it is useless to try to explain that the problem is due to the simultaneous implementation of the new production plans," Churchill says.
JJ Churchill has responded to the challenge by investing £800 000 in new machinery and employing 26 new employees.
A number of operators believe that more investment and coordination between small suppliers is needed if Britain wants to retain its position as the second largest player in the aviation industry after the United States.
The chairman of Ford Aerospace and Tyneseside fine mechanics, Geoff Ford, say that the order intake should increase producers' confidence and want to expand and increase production capacity, as work needs to be done.
"If this does not happen, we will lose in competition against other countries," Ford says.
Some large players are trying to solve the problem by acquiring capacity.
The FTSE 250-in-in-chief company Senior purchased the parts of the aircraft operating in Malaysia for UPECA’s 75 million pounds.
MB Aerospace bought companies from North America and Poland last year.
"It is possible to buy start-up companies that create new activities, but actually the most slowing down in production is the limited design and the number of engineers," says Gallagher MB Aerospace.
Both small and large companies have mentioned the price pressure that has shifted to them from large aircraft manufacturers and aircraft engines manufacturers.
Some believe that the problems of the operators in the production chain are exaggerated.
Marcus Bryson, head of GKN’s Aeroplane Production Unit, who also acts as a representative of the UK aviation industry, is of the opinion that the production chain has dealt with the problem better than in previous years.
The supply chain is under pressure, but I wouldn't describe the situation as critical.
"The introduction of new technologies and advanced processes is more important than currents," says Bryson.
Both Airbus and Boeing have learned from the mistakes and are now more careful not to increase building volumes too quickly.
When Boeing tried to increase its production in 1997, it faced major difficulties when the company lost and the factories and the production chain fought to survive.
Tony Wood, Director of the Rolls Royce Aeroplane Production Unit, says that the company has not yet encountered problems in the production chain, which delivers most of the 18 000 parts needed to manufacture the jet engine.
"You will certainly be in a hole, but we believe that we have done more in-depth work on the supply chain by choosing the best partners and contacting the suppliers as they prepare to increase their activity," Wood says.
According to Boeing’s CEO James McNerney, the company’s production chain has had time to increase supply volumes.
We have a good feeling about the strength of the production chain.
We have acted openly towards journalists, which is very important.
The CEO of the Airbus passenger jet production unit, Fabrice Brégier, says that the company will do everything in its power to reduce the risks associated with its plans to increase the production of the A350 model to 10 machines per month by 2018.
"Maybe one of the journalists will not succeed, and it is our job to try to prevent this situation as well as to support journalists and look for alternatives, but there are great problems to be encountered", Brégier says.
Bregiér says that Airbus is not looking for scapegoats: "The quality of the production chain lies with the editor-in-chief.
So this is my job and that of Airbus."
Hong Kong's demonstrations will begin the "time of civil disobedience" in Beijing's ban on open elections
China refuses to give Hong Kong full democracy
Activists supporting democracy are spreading to Hong Kong streets after China has rejected the requirements for their open elections.
The groups in favour of democracy in Hong Kong stress that the demonstrations can be marked and swear to ensure that the city begins to 'an era of civil disobedience' in order to oppose the reforms proposed by the Chinese government regarding the elections.
Thousands of protestors attacked the coming rain of Hong Kong's glowing horizon when they walked into a demonstration organised by the Occupy Central Group in support of democracy in front of the bodies of the Council responsible for the implementation of the laws on Sunday night, where the protestors called on people to participate in a wide-ranging sitting demonstration in order to bring down the city's financial quarter.
The demonstration took place only hours after Beijing announced that it would deny voters the right to propose candidates publicly in the mayor's elections in 2017 in violation of the months-long demonstrations that will further increase the town's dual periods.
The protesters take part in the demonstration of the Occupy Central movement in front of the central government buildings in Hong Kong.
"We want a fair and decent election," says Dion Tse, a 24-year-old website manager, who participated in the Sunday demonstration with his 50-year-old mother Wong Chi-yi.
The government doesn't respect the Hong Kong voice.
We want the government to listen to us and see the determination of the Hong Kongers.
China's highest law-making body, the People's Congress of China, adopted plans for electoral changes, allowing only two candidates to participate in the first direct elections in Hong Kong.
However, approval of the 1200-person nomination committee is required for the candidate, and opposition politicians believe that this effectively prevents the disparate political views from getting into the electoral flags.
The protestors participate in the demonstration organised in connection with the Occupy Central Love and Peace protest, which was carried out in Tamar Park in front of the Hong Kong Government Building.
Police estimates that more than 2 600 people were currently involved in the demonstration.
A large number of police officers followed when some 100 protestors led by the Scholarism Student Group gathered late on Sunday at Grand Hyatt, where Li Fein, member of the Communist Party, was scheduled to stay after arriving in Beijing.
Benny Tai, one of the founders of Occupy Central, attended a press conference with members of the Alliance for True Democracy, Scholarism and Federation of Students.
Or not to comply with the law, however, with the exact date on which the road blockage takes place, but called on the participants to closely monitor the development of the situation over the next few weeks, while adding that the city is officially moving to the "time of civil disobedience".
Benny Tai will answer the press questions.
"Look at the person next to you," he said at the Sunday demonstration, standing in front of the two figures representing disobedience in China.
That man takes over the center with you!
Joshua Wong, 17-year-old convenings representing Scholarism, said earlier that preparations for the demonstrations of high school students are under way and are planned to be held at the same time as thousands of university students are expected to show their opinion by refusing to teach.
"In addition to academic responsibility, we have our social responsibility," Wong says.
In Beijing, Deputy Secretary General Li Fei of the People's Congress Committee told journalists that the defence of the general right to 'international requirements' is 'time-loss' and from some Hong Kong politicians who are trying to 'mingle society and mislead it'.
"The impractical proposals such as the nomination of a public candidate have wasted a lot of time," Li says, calling for a method of election to be created in such a way as to fit the real situation of each society and the legislative framework.
The general right law can only be adopted if a large majority, i.e. two-thirds of the Hong Kong 70-based legislative body, supports this, which means that 27 opposition members of the government can stop the initiative.
Li warned that Hong Kong might be dragged into a long-term political debate if the reform proposal was rejected by veto.
"It would harm business and the development of the city," he says.
Almost 800 000 people voted in an informal questionnaire organised by the Occupy Central in June to oppose Chinese requirements, according to which the candidate needs the approval of the committee.
As many as 172 000 people marched for democracy on 1 July, at the same time as the March in favour of Beijing and against the Occupy Central on 17 August attracted some 88 000 participants, although the estimates of the figures come from the University of Hong Kong, although the estimates of the police and the organisers differ considerably from these figures.
Three wounded lightning discharges on New York's beach.
In a lightning strike on a New York bathing beach, three people were injured.
According to the fire department, the men were injured on the Orchard Beach beach at Pelham Bay in the Bronx on Sunday night when the storms went through the area.
The injured men are in hospital.
The extent of the injuries is unknown.

I'm not supposed to like this new idea.
This is the latest guide for network users to employees and supervisors, and is shared by Harvey Schachter, author of the Monday Morning Manager site.
According to Entrepreneur Seth Godin, a good idea is to identify comments like "I don't like it" or "I don't understand."
If this is not the case, the idea is probably popular and self-evident – i.e. boring and everyday – or the benefits it brings are so little that it is not worth reaching for.
As a historian, Harvard Drew Gilpin never repeated anything that had already been published so that people would not think that he had nothing new to offer.
Now, as principal of the university, he is repeating the same thing several times to get the message widely.
Advertising consultant Bob Hoffman believes that TV and radio are the best tools to create demand, while the network creates supply.
The fact that more and more people are reading news about the network does not mean that the Internet is good between advertising – just as the first phone was a popular communication tool but a bad option for advertisers.
Psychologist Heidi Grant Halverson says that one word is enough to motivate workers: together.
One of the participants in the study was told that they decided to work together, although in fact they worked alone in an empty room, and these participants worked longer and solved more problems than the participants who were not told about the cooperation at the beginning.
If the task is to find a repeat pattern or relationship between the two units, the performer Dave Paradi advises you to forget Microsoft’s SmartArt and instead use the Diagrammer.com program where you can choose between 14 different relationships.
Circumventions in the Mount Stuart hospital ban because of safety risk
A specialist doctor has been suspended temporarily, and the national health system in the UK, NHS, ceased to direct patients to this private hospital after the hospital problems emerged.
Two people went to Torbay Hospital after being treated at Mount Stuart Hospital in Torquay.
The Torbay hospital in Devon has said that he was in contact with 19 patients who were being treated on 26 July and called for a "fast clinical investigation".
The Mount Stuart hospital regretted the matter and said that it had been examined after the doctor had been dismissed.
It came to the attention of Torbay Hospital when two patients in Mount Stuart had applied for it in the emergency room because of their eye problems.
According to Torbay Hospital, none of the 19 NHS patients who were all investigated on the same day had to undergo surgery.
Torbay Hospital and the hospital district of South Devon and Torbay have not directed patients to treatment with Mount Stuart since problems occurred.
David Sinclair, the interim director of the South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation, leading Torbay Hospital, said that "we have identified the problem at its initial stage and were able to contact all the patients concerned quickly.
Whenever we direct patients to a service provider, we perform quality and safety tests and ensure that the service provider meets the latest legal requirements and that its licensing issues are in order.
According to Gill Gant, the head of the hospital care area of South Devon and Torbay, "patient safety is always absolutely one, so it is important that these cataracts are not performed for as long as we can be absolutely sure that the treatment is safe".
Ramsay Health Care UK, managing Mount Stuart, asked "all patients who experienced complications".
The company was announced that "when we learned of the possible problem, we and later at the Torbay hospital were called to all the patients involved".
This specialist doctor has been authorised by Ramsay Health Care since 2005 and has been a registered doctor since 1989.
To date, he has performed 4,537 cataract surgery in different parts of the organization. According to statistics, the clinical results of the surgery he performed have been excellent and the complications percentage has been less than 0.5%.
Mount Stuart added that the doctor has been suspended temporarily until the case has been investigated.
What's "4chan"?
A malignant anonymous communication site first published celebrity leaked nude images
What exactly is "4chan" and why was it the first option of the hacker when he published the images stolen?
"4chan" was set up in 2003. It has raised the debate on a communication website, which is called "as much as it is praised".
The site is divided into several parts, so-called notice boards, where anonymous users can discuss everything possible, video games and travel to pornography and hacking.
Unlike other web forums, users do not create a single, constantly used profile and their publications are not kept.
Comments on the most popular bulletin tables may disappear in less than a minute, when the latest publications supersede them at the bottom of the page.
These two factors have created a chaotic, anarchist and surprisingly creative atmosphere in "4chan".
An anonymous community has created some of the most well-known forms of the network (such as "rickrolling" and "lolcats"), but the lack of the website's rules has also led to a lot of questionable or criminal content on the site.
The most popular notice table on the site is /b/, which is intended for mixed discussions and is regularly published with NSFW content (Not Safe For Work).
This may include tame porn, but also rough and shocking images. An anonymous hacker published famous stolen images on this notice board in the weekend.
American CytRx invests anticancer drugs in research and development
The aim of CytRx is to cure cancer – or at least slow it down.
A company in Los Angeles that produced biological drugs, which recently became the target of a conflict due to stock efficiency, has been specialised in the research and development of anticancer medicines.
The most promising medicine is aldoxorubicin, which is a more advanced form of doxorubicin used commonly in chemotherapy.
CytRx performs clinical trials in aldoxorubicin in soft tissue sarcoma, AIDS-related Kapos sarcoma and renewable glioblastoma or brain tumours.
It's like a controlled missile that passes directly to the tumour and not to the rest of the body, says CEO of CytRx, Steven Kriegsman, a cancer medicine called aldoxorubicin.
Aldoxorubicin contains what is known as "association technology", which acts like a Trojan horse.
It binds directly to a protein in the blood, which also accumulates in tumours, causing the medicine to enter cancer cells directly.
The combination only delivers the medicine in an acidic environment, i.e. cancer cells, but not in a healthy tissue.
This technology allows patients to receive more cancer medication and more than one dose.
"This is like a missile that travels directly to the tumor and not to the rest of the body," says CEO of CytRx, Steven Kriegsman.
Like many other biotechnology companies that focus on drug development, CytRx does not make a profit.
This year, the company sold shares and thus collected 86 million dollars for business maintenance and research.
CytRx is currently looking for 400 patients worldwide in the crucial 3-stage clinical trial for alternative treatment of soft tissue sarcoma.
Soft tissue sarcoma is a type of cancer that develops in soft tissues in the body, such as blood vessels, muscles and fat.
Alternative therapy is used for the treatment of cancer when the initial treatment does not lead to results.
If the clinical trial is successful, CytRx plans to apply for authorisation from the US Food and Drug Administration already in 2016, says Kriegsman.
The medicinal product could then be authorised for use in 2017.
Analysts say that information published by CytRx in December from previous clinical study showed that aldoxorubicin is a promising treatment for soft tissue sarcoma.
"For a long time, the question was "we have not seen clinical information on how much it differs from the medicine itself," says the analyst Andrew Fein of H.C. Wainwright & Co.
The publication of the results confirmed many people's opinions that this treatment is different.
However, Fein says that it is difficult to predict the results and timing of the current clinical trial because it is significantly different from the previous study that produced good results.
"Many things have to go right," he says.
Fein compares the development of medicines with the mining industry.
"At first, a lot of money will be invested to find that one gold salt, and the location will continue for so long that that gold salt will be found," he says.
The money will be spent on research and development for as long as the medicine is successfully commercialised.
Several shareholders have tried to sue CytRx because they felt that it gave a better picture of its success.
In the application, the company is accused of employing a DreamTeam Group who then claimed to have hired people to write positive comments on CytRx and another biotech company forbes, Seeing Alpha, Motley Fool and Wall Street Cheat Sheet on pages such as Forbes, Seeing Alpha, Motley Fool and Wall Street Cheat Sheet.
According to the case-law, the articles did not reveal that the companies paid fees to the authors.
As a result of the news, Seeing Alpha announced that he had removed the articles "which were contrary to practice".
Other sites also deleted several company articles.
Kriegsman refused to comment.
The company has hired an external lawyer to respond to the complaints.
"I have no time or energy to focus on this," Kriegsman says.
According to him, the real challenge for CytRx is to find talented workers who usually seek employment in biotech centres such as San Diego, San Francisco and Boston.
"This is in many respects a wilderness from the point of view of the pharmaceutical industry," he says.
Analyst’s views
The price of CytRx's shares rose to $8.08 on 10 January and then in April fell to less than $3 when the charges for the advertising of shares became public.
According to Analyst magazine, claims and negative publicity have fallen the price of shares below their real value.
"It's unfortunate," Fein says, "but I'm not sure if there's any easy way to pass this thing as long as the concept is valid".
In the name of the law, a cameraman in the police series was killed in the middle of the shootings.
The photographer of a series based on real events, in the name of the Law in Finland, died on Tuesday night when he was shot in the middle of the shooting middle.
The cameraman photographed the shooting between the armed robbery of a local police force and a fast-food restaurant when he was hit by bullets.
He died quickly from injuries he suffered.
According to the TMZ site, a person who was suspected of armed robbery died in the shooting scene, apart from a cameraman.
The first series of real-time TV programmes, in the name of the Law, has been presented in the United States since 1989.
In Finland, the series has been presented on MTV channels since the 1990s.
The question of an external factor will be raised in the court proceedings that started today in the case of Ulvila's murder.
Anneli Auer is accused of the murder of her husband, Jukka S. Lahti, in 2006.
It is the second time that the Tribunal of Vaasa has dealt with the case, since the Supreme Court has returned it to district court with a new evidence.
The purpose of the Court of Justice is that the judgment should still be given on the side of this year.
The right of court was released by Auer in 2011.
At that time, the Court considered the possibility of an external author to be sufficiently likely.
In his opening speech, the District Attorney Kalle Kulmala explained the prosecutor's view of the night of the murder and the circumstances that exclude the possibility of an outsider.
In our opinion, the crucial question is whether the house has become an external factor that has killed Jukka Lahti in the way and in time told by Anneli Auer.
It is about the credibility of Anneli Auer's report," Kulmala said.
According to the prosecutor, he started a family dispute during which Auer had announced that he was leaving home and seeking divorce.
At some point, they moved to the kitchen where Lahti held onto Auer and tried to stop him from leaving.
One of them took a kitchen knife", Kulmala described the events of the night of death on Monday.
According to the prosecutor, several evidences show that there was no external factor.
For example, the emergency call tape does not include any voice on the outside.
In the interrogation, Auer's oldest child, the daughter told me that she saw the unsub leaving the fireplace door.
The judgment of the Court of Justice of Vaasa in 2011 was partly based on the daughter's report.
According to the D.A., the daughter's observation cannot be correct.
"The daughter didn't see the outside factor in the parents' bedroom, although she visited there twice," Kulmala said.
The new witness in the prosecutor's office is precisely related to the possibility of an outsider.
Jukka S. Lahti's sister has been telling us what happened since the night of the murder at the hospital.
According to the woman, the only thing she told at the hospital was that she only saw Lahti's body when she was at the death site in the fireplace room.
Mr Auer's defence intends to introduce to the court guidelines of inquiry, which, according to the defence, have not been sufficiently clarified by the police.
Three years ago, when the court court court of Vaasa released Auer from the charge, the court thought that a foreign man's DNA had been found in the hug as one of the references to an outsider.
The sample subsequently proved to be the DNA of a researcher working in the Central Criminal Police Laboratory.
A DNA sample was taken on mass sampling by 700 people.
At the same time, a significant number of serious suspects and alternative investigation lines were excluded," said defence attorney Juha Manner.
One of the new witnesses of defense is about a possible outsider.
The U.S.woman told the police about a guerrillaist who, according to the woman's report, had confessed to the act.
The police questioned the man this summer.
The D.A. has decided that the P.O.D. has nothing to do with a homicide.
The prosecutor filed a request for an investigation because the prosecutor suspected she was lying in her report.
One of the new witnesses in defense is a nurse who worked the night of death at the Satakunta Central Hospital.
Auer's district court sentenced him to life sentence for murder in December last year.
According to the judgment of the district court, the possibility of an outsider was warred against, among other things, reports by Auer’s children, voice from the emergency storage facility missing an external factor, and the time required for the course of events.
The verdict came out of two to one.
A minority judge wrote that in a criminal case, conflicting evidence must be interpreted as in the interest of the accused.
That is why the story of the daughter must be interpreted so that, despite the contradictions in the report, she had found an external author leaving the door of the fireplace.
Auer's two oldest children have been called court-martial hearings.
The daughter was first heard personally last year in the district court of Satakunta.
In court, he no longer remembered the events of the night of the murder.
Auer’s second oldest child named her mother a killer in a video interview in 2011.
The boy told me he heard the events of the night of the murder outside the closed door.
He also told me that Auer was planning to kill for six months.
As an attorney, the boy has no obligation to say anything in court.
The court trial continues today with the consultation of Anneli Auer.
If necessary, the hearing of Auer will continue tomorrow.
Anneli Auer is currently serving more than seven years in prison for sexual and violent crimes against children.
Should Putin be allowed to attend the G20?
Putin's actions in Ukraine have made him a number of first-rate enemies.
Putin is due to attend the G20 Summit in Brisbane in November, and Australia is discussing with passion whether or not its entry should be allowed.
The punkrock Activist Group Pussy Riot called on Australia to ban Putin's participation in a summit with over 4,000 representatives from the world's most influential states.
"This person, in our opinion, has nothing to do with the G20," said Maria Alyokhina to the public at the opera house full of Sydney in connection with the Festival of Dancerous Ideas.
Kiev has warned that he is on the brink of a "complete war", and Putin calls parts of Ukraine "Novorussia", or "the new Russia". So is it necessary to welcome him?
Tony Abbott has said he's working on a decision.
According to Mike Callaghan, Director of Lowy Institute G20, Australians cannot decide who will attend the meeting, even if the meeting is held in the country.
"Australia can decide who it will let down, but this is an international meeting," he says.
Just as in the case of New York's administration of UN meetings or Washington's management of International Monetary Fund meetings, "the master's task is not to deny someone called to come," Callaghan says.
Last week, Tony Abbott said that he was going to "burden the decision" after Russia's atrocious actions in Ukraine.
This is a very important issue.
Since Putin is coming to a very important international meeting, Australia has no right to decide on its own.
"However, there is an important issue that I will weigh a lot, and I believe that other countries will do so in the coming weeks," he says.
People attend an anti-war meeting in Mariupo, Eastern Ukraine.
The event takes two days, involving a wide range of representatives of the largest and fastest-developed economies in the world, with around two-thirds of the world's population, representing 85% of the world's GDP and 75% of international trade.
Members include Canada, China, France, Japan, Russia, the United States and the European Union, as well as a few invited guests from countries not members of the G20, such as New Zealand, Singapore and Myanmar.
According to Callaghan, Australia had a questionable task of balancing the various interests under great public pressure.
In his view, the Prime Minister's best way of dealing with this is to take advantage of the opportunity to pressure Russia to speak publicly about its recent actions.
"The Prime Minister should say that we are going to take this opportunity to seek a very open dialogue and that he will demand President Putin to make an account of his actions."
If Putin comes to the meeting, it is his duty to give an explanation of his actions," Callaghan says.
There is clearly an increase in geopolitical pressure.
I think the world expects these things to be discussed.
Russian-minded rebels are preparing weapons for the attack on Ukrainian military bases at Donetsk Airport in eastern Ukraine.
It is still unclear whether Puti will attend the meeting, and Callaghan says that this is not necessarily known until a few days in advance.
I'm sure this is the last thing in Putin's mind.
He hardly states that 'I must change my attitude towards Ukraine because I desperately want to go to Brisbane in November'.
The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, takes Putin's approach to Australia's "extremely reservation", but understands that this is an international conference.
It is probably time for the Prime and Foreign Ministers to discuss with other countries and the G20s whether it is appropriate to allow Putin to enter Australia.
It's an international conference, not an Australian conference, I understand that.
After the tragic events that followed the Malaysian Airlines accident, as well as the lack of proper cooperation in terms of pity, responsibility and accident, and now that thousands of Russian soldiers are on the border with Ukraine, I think that most Australians are very committed to welcoming Putin to Australia.
Germany's business world criticises the "serious" Berlin
Some German top management warns that Germany has become "untrustful" and "virtuous", as government policy threatens the competitiveness of the country.
The criticism of the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel happens at the same time as the largest European economy is showing signs of slowdown, which is a cause for concern as to whether it is able to run economic growth in the euro area which is in a position to be inflamed.
The criticism of business leaders is the result of the fierce opposition of the German business sector to political decisions, including the introduction of minimum wages and the reduction of the retirement age of certain long-term employees to 63 years.
"I think the biggest threat right now is excessive confidence in Germany, which inevitably causes the feeling of self-loathing", says Kurt Bock, the CEO of the world's largest chemical manufacturer, based on sales figures.
EU economy
He takes this view: "In general terms, it is the feeling that we are doing well, we have money for use and unemployment at a relatively low level, so what is the problem?"
I think there's a great danger.
It is clear from the German Government's policy that we do not focus on growth and are not a favourable environment for businesses, but instead we focus considerably more on sharing wealth and meeting the expectations of certain parties.
According to Markus Kerber, CEO of BDI of the German Industrial Organisation, "The situation in Germany is now good.
In the next ten years, however, every advanced economy must change. ...[Germany] reform programme will not achieve as much progress as in previous years.
The National Chamber of Commerce DIHK has also expressed criticism of recent political developments.
Germany's unemployment has remained at a low level and the budget is almost balanced.
However, the decline in GDP in the second quarter has highlighted the vulnerability of the export-profited Germany to external shocks such as Russia and Ukraine.
GDP fell by 0.2% in the three months preceding June compared to the previous year.
Germany's poor performance is likely to make the ECB's fight against low inflation even more difficult, and it may make quantitative recovery more likely.
Kerber would like the government to "return from public consumption to public investment", for example by focusing on the additions of future consumption to infrastructure and not to pensions.
According to Kerber, the Merkel government is destroying the fruit of his social-democratic predecessor Gerhard Schröder in the early 2000s by means of a strict policy.
According to Stefan Heidbreeder, CEO of the Stiftung Familienunternehmen Foundation for Family Enterprises, "The situation in Germany is still good compared to other countries.
It is thanks to companies and not to government policy. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The example of the neighbouring country, France, has shown that the use of money for social assistance and the restriction of the freedom of management of the company are the wrong way to act.
The leading German investment banker described the situation more explicitly, saying that the recent decisions of the government are a 'sacrifice'.
Germany is threatening to lose everything it has worked so hard to please the voters.
This is my main concern at the moment," the banker says.
According to Mr Bock, the energy reforms of the new government coalition failed to address the fundamental weaknesses of the policy that have led to the cost of reducing competitiveness for the industry.
Ashton Kutcher's handcuffed music festival after security has blocked access to the fan
Actor Ashton Kutcher participated in the Stagecoach Cantric Festival in Indio, California, where he is reported to have been fighting with a strict security officer.
Ashton Kutcher is reported to have been in a fight with a security guard at a country music festival.
Kutcher's fan tried to approach him at backstage at the Stage Cocoach Cantric Festival in California, after which the situation was robbed, says the TMZ site.
Kutcher was in the VIP room when a young woman approached him to greet him and shake his hand.
When the star of the Men's Series went to greet the fan, an overzealous security guard stepped in and caused the snoop.
The actor and the security officer got into a round of hand, and Kutcher's friends had to stop Kutcher, says TMZ.
After separating from his ex-wife, Demi Moore Kutcher is dating Mila Kunis, who, like Kutcher, is the stars of the ex-70s show.
It happened shortly after Angus T. Jones had practically removed the series from the standard actor card after he published a video in which he calls the series "scum" and urges fans not to view it.
Actor Ashton Kutcher attends Stagecach Music Festivals in California.
Angus T. Jones, "Jake", calls the show "scum" and urges people not to look at it.
Baltic Sea bacteria killed a vacationer.
Six people have been infected with the bacteria of the popular German tourist destination from the Caribbean.
One of the sick is in a coma.
Vibrio vulnificus is found in parts of the Baltic Sea and other parts of the world, but most of it is found in the Gulf of Mexico.
The bacteria are most effective in spreading in breaking water at over 20 degrees.
"Bacteria can be found anywhere, as long as the conditions are right", Dr. Heiko Will, Director of the Health and Safety Agency of Mecklen-Vorpommern (LAGuS), told The Local.
The bacteria are equally found in Denmark, Poland and along the German coast.
According to the LAGuS, the sick had been on vacation on Usedom Island at the end of July.
He died early in August.
Another pensioner has been in a coma for three weeks now, and it is possible that his leg will have to be amputated.
He went swimming near Ahrenshop with a small wound on his leg.
The sick one went to the hospital after he found on his way home that his leg had turned blue.
Doctors found blood poisoning caused by Vibrio vulnificus in the leg.
"My husband would certainly not have spent time in the Baltic region if he had known of the danger," Sonja Bruehl, the sick wife told Ostsee Zeitung.
A serious illness and the damage caused to the patient and his family by blood poisoning could have been avoided if information had been better available, for example if the residence had been able to produce a leaflet.
The LAGuS told the Dpa news office that the next infection situation was called at the beginning of the summer, but no official notice was given.
Cool temperatures have resulted in a lower risk of bacterial disease.
"It turns out from the test results on Monday that the strain of V. vulnificus has decreased significantly," says Dr. Will.
Cool weather has worked.
Vibrio vulnificus, a relative of a cholera-induced bacteria, is particularly dangerous if a person has a history of chronic liver disease and a reduced immune response, such as in patients with HIV or diabetes mellitus and older people.
Men are at greater risk of disease than women, as the estrogen has been detected to protect against pathogenic agents.
If the bacteria get infected, it causes blood poisoning and sepsis.
The probability of death after the bacterial wound is about 25%.
V. vulnificus can also be infected by eating infected marine organisms, although Dr. Will says this is not the case.
The contamination of food from the sea is more common in the southern hemisphere.
In Germany, V. vulnificus caused poisoning the previous time in 2010, when two people died.
Viio Kekkonen: Breast removed due to suspected cancer
The revelation of the 80 - year - old singer Vieno Kekkonen is working and working hard, but he has also had to fear for his health.
I can't believe Vieno Kekkonen, who's beaming, is 80 years old.
He himself is amazed at how suddenly so many years of age can be.
I haven't quite realized that I'm this old.
For 80 years, it sounds so much, Vieno Kekkonen laughs.
His birthday, Vieno Kekkonen, is spending time with his family.
At the end of August, he had a birthday party organised by the folk music and pension society in Karttula, where he lived his childhood.
We were on the stage of Kekkola, in the same place my grandfather was born.
I was so embarrassed about the party, the birthday hero tells me about the occasion where the stage of three hundred was filled with congratulations.
A few days later, Armi Kuusela was gathered at Muhos, whose life Viino Kekkonen remembers having followed as a young man.
And now we're both this age!
Viino Kekkonen laughs.
During his long career, there are only a few aspects that Vieno Kekkonen has not been seen in public.
One thing he has never publicly stated before: 2006 was removed from his second breast.
There was an unclear finding on my chest at a point where it was decided to be completely removed.
After all, it was not cancer, of course, which I was happy about.
A new breast was performed in the same operation, so it was a pretty big procedure.
Vieno Kekkonen has not thought of losing his own chest in vain, for knowledge of the unclear discovery would have been a heavy strain and cannot be ignored.
I was just so relieved when nothing was serious, Vieno Kekkonen tells me and points out that losing my own breast is probably harder for the younger ones.
Read all about Vieno Kekkonen's extensive personal interview in the evening-Sanomi.

The farmer is made guilty of marine condition
The debate on the weak state of the Baltic Sea and its link with Finnish agriculture is depressive.
The voice of experts has been drowned in politically intended opinions.
In particular, during the summer, Helsingin Sanomat and Yle have been industrious about agricultural responsibility for nutrient emissions to the Baltic Sea.
The same breath has called for rapid action to control emissions.
The average farmer appears to be a few environmental scientists and, by their means, qualified suppliers compared to a superior nutrition expert.
The farmer knows that the nutrients cannot come from cultivation if the same amount of nutrients have been sown in the field as the crop is harvested there.
In Finland almost all farms are committed to the environmental programme.
It limits the use of fertilisers strictly and requires close monitoring and reporting of nutrient balances.
The authorities shall monitor compliance with the conditions.
The nutrients stored in the field have also been flushed into water bodies after leaching restrictions, but there has been a clear reduction in emissions for many years, too.
Farmers have the will and willingness to continue working to reduce nutrient emissions.
However, everyone should realise that access to zero is impossible.
"If we want to have about the consumption of agricultural production, we just have to accept that this is the case", says Jyrki Aakkula, Director of Environmental Research at MTT (MT 29.8).
The past summer brought large blues to the Gulf of Finland.
The researchers agreed that the rest gained its growth power from marine phosphorous stocks.
The phosphorus stored in the bottom of the sea is partly a potato from the agriculture of coastal states over the past decades, but it alone does not explain the stocks.
The waste water treatment of the growing cities on the Baltic Sea coasts was on a backdrop until the end of the 20th century.
The problem also concerned the waste water in Great Helsinki and was not seen as a problem as far as the pollution on its own beaches is concerned.
The pollution of the beaches was prevented by the construction of a waste water pipe on the open sea in the 1980s.
Of course, over the years, the quality of water directed there has improved.
In the past, nutrients that have ended up in the sea will not leave the sea even if agriculture is completely discontinued from Finland.
However, every summer's blue debate and accusations are always directed at agriculture today.
The public debate will mark the farmer guilty of the state of the Baltic Sea.
The charge is unreasonable, but it becomes increasingly difficult when used to carry out political passions.
The Greens are driving major changes to the environmental standards of agriculture under the leadership of their President, Minister for the Environment, Ville Niinistö.
The Niinistö has spent the summer's resting conversation.
In very short terms, Niinistö has accused the producer's representative organisation of the old stock of MTK and considered it to be the most difficult obstacle to the protection of water.
There's got to be some kind of limit on political rhetoric.
Most specific projects for water protection are specifically based on cooperation between the OCT, farmers and environmental management.
The attacking style of the Niinistö serves more the fishing of city greens than the protection of water.
I think that's the point.
With tough speeches, the Greens are ready to leave the government.
In policy changes, the role of the MSC is to ensure the survival of its members.
It is difficult to trade changes that are expensive for farmers unless a replacement can be found for their costs.
The only money that Ville Niinistö has presented is cuts from other agricultural money.
The cancellation of the mining tax does not go through: Palmer
The latest attempt of the Abbott government to throw a mining tax in the trash basket seems doomed, for Clive Palmer has declared that his senators will reject it without any changes.
The Australian Labour Party also fears that the new initiative has included a rule restricting employers' additions to compulsory pension contributions up to 2034.
The government took advantage of a qualified majority in Parliament's lower room on Monday to speed up the process of annulment in general confusion and in the face of a clear nuisance from the Labour Party.
It put aside the original annulment initiative, to which the Senate had made significant changes in the past, and replaced it with a new bill, which it described in particular related to taxes, pension contributions, social security and family social assistance.
Originally, it was an initiative aimed at overcoming the "lossed" mining tax and other decisions, such as the low-income pension contribution (saving USD 3.6 billion), the income subsidy bonus ($1.3 billion) and the bonus for school-age children ($ 4.7 billion).
Clive Palmer, director of the Palmer United Party (PUP) did not accept the transfer of the government.
"The planned proposal to reverse the mine tax is not adopted in the Senate without a pension contribution for the low incomes, a bonus for income support and a bonus for school-age children", he twittered.
The government needs the support of independent parties such as the PUP to ensure that the Labour Party and the Greens do not oppose the initiative in the Senate.
Mr Bowen accused the government of trying to remove Parliament's power to decide on the compulsory amount of pension contributions, giving the Minister of Finance all the power to decide.
"This is unprecedented," he said to journalists in Canberra.
In this way, the government could delay other additions so that the 12% target of the Labour Party pension guarantee could be passed up to 2034.
"It is not acceptable in any way, and the Labour Party will, of course, be opposed by all means," Bowen says.
The guarantee is now 9.5%, but the government wants to give the Minister of Finance the power to decide to suspend future additions.
A man's body was found on the beach of Brighton.
The Sussex police picked up the body of an unidentified man before the tide of two o'clock, and the police shut down the area near the very beginning of the Volk's Electric Railway tourist attraction.
The police and the M.E.A. are working to find out the circumstances under which the body was found on the beach.
The man hasn't been identified yet.
Researchers will review the list of missing persons to find out if the missing persons have contact with the body.
The police have not yet been able to confirm whether death occurred under suspicious circumstances.
According to the Mexican police, in an accident at the border, one death victim.
According to the police of Piedras Negras, the accident in the customs building at the border between Mexico and the United States resulted in the death of one woman and the injury of five other persons.
Felix Alberto Lopez Arenas is the operational leader of the local police of the city on the Texas border.
He told the Associated Press News Office that a woman who died in a Sunday explosion suffered skull damage and five other burns.
According to Lopez Arenas, the explosion took place this morning in the customs officers' overnight quarters.
The cause of the explosion is being investigated, but the authorities believe that the explosion has occurred in the gathering of gases.
The explosion didn't affect the border guard.
Three Atlantic City casinos will close in September
Three Atlantic City casinos are closing their doors this month.
The male client plays at the Showboat casino, which is supposed to close its doors, Atlantic City, N.J., 29.7.2014
September is expected to have a difficult month for Atlantic City, when three casinos are handing out their last cards on the table.
Three casinos close their doors this month in Atlantic City, New Jersey, which means that this neolight metropolis, known as the Kin of the money machines, can no longer count on the income of the game.
More than 5,000 workers are left unemployed at the closure of Showboat and Revel casinos this weekend, the Associated Press News Office told us.
There'll be more unemployed when Trump Plaza turns off his light.
Three casinos, one of which had only been able to operate for two years, are expected to be the last disaster in the city after the story of the Atlantic Club centre ended only eight months earlier.
By the end of September more than 25% of the city’s casino workers, 8 000 people, will be unemployed, New York Times writes.
When gambling was allowed in New Jersey in 1976, casinos were advertised as a sure choice for Atlantic City suffering from a bad economy, the AP news office writes.
However, the local gambling industry has gained a lot more competitors when New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania casinos block a large part of Atlantic City once so huge.
Even previously opposed to gambling, Massachusetts looks at its share of money by welcoming three casinos to the state.
TVO: Areva’s new schedule is difficult to accept
According to the Industrial Powers (TVO), it is difficult to accept the new assessment by the plant supplier Areva that Olkiluoto’s third reactor will only be available for commercial use in 2018.
According to the manager of the power plant project, Jouni Silvennoinen, this is due, among other things, to the fact that construction works are already largely ready and the number of works in progress is well known.
TVO will continue to assess the information received from Areva.
In its Communication, Silvennoinen states that TVO welcomes all initiatives to speed up the project.
Areva today provided TVO with an updated schedule for Olkiluoto 3, according to which the building work of the Third Reactor will be completed in mid-2016 and commercial activities could begin in 2018.
According to the Areva press release, recent delays in the project have mainly resulted from the approval of reactor automation systems, which was received in April.
This was preceded by four years of negotiations with TVO.
Olkiluoto 3 was supposed to be ready as early as 2009, but the schedule has been delayed once.
TVO and Areva have been fighting for years about which one is responsible for the delay.
Discuss the wood in arbitration law, where Areva has charged TVO up to EUR 2.7 billion for compensation.
TVO, on the other hand, considers Areva’s claims unwarranted and requires some EUR 1.8 billion from the company.
Cooperation between energy and water actors is needed in the face of global challenges
International leaders met today in Stockholm within the framework of the 24th International Water Week, calling on energy and water actors to work together to meet the greatest challenges of our time to ensure that enough water and energy production are produced to an increasing population.
The theme of the 2014 Water Week is Energy and Water.
Water and energy are very often interdependent.
Energy is needed for pumping, storing, transporting and cleaning water, and for almost all energy production.
If one of these increases or decreases, it will affect the other immediately.
These two funds are also an integral part of sustainable development and should always be borne in mind when making global decisions.
Torgny Holmgren, CEO of the Stockholm International Water Institute, organized by the Water Week, said in the opening of the Water Week that "the challenges are huge".
Global water consumption is expected to increase by 55% between 2000 and 2050, and energy consumption is expected to increase by 50% over the next two decades, and therefore there is an urgent need for closer cooperation between energy and water actors to find solutions to help all the peoples of the world to flourish.
Professor John Briscoe, who received this year's Water Week Award, described water as an enabling basis for growth, needed by society as a whole and by other sectors. Briscoe said that "the developing countries face major challenges.
They have to mobilize these funds.
Briscoe added that there is no permanent solution to the [water crisis] anywhere.
Instead, there are challenges and solutions that form a circle.
Over a week, representatives will discuss ongoing and future work and cooperation between energy and water actors during more than a hundred seminars, workshops and events.
Professor John Briscoe, originally from South Africa, will receive the Stockholm Water Prize His Majesty, King of Sweden, Kaarle XVI, at a ceremony at the Stockholm City Hall on Thursday, 4 September.
The Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) is a research centre that produces research information and provides information to decision-makers so that they can make sensible decisions for water and sustainable development.
Flying dead foreign bodies home in Miami: Costs of body flying
In October 2012, a ferry carrying 23 Cuban refugees to Miami fell, and 14 people were reported dead.
The same has happened to hundreds before, and I'm sure it wasn't the last of it.
Every year more than 1 000 U.S. migrants die trying illegally to cross the U.S. border.
Because of the first town, they're ready to die.
However, it is ironic that after arriving in the first city in the country, few plan to stay there until their last breath.
For many, this city is a temporary place of residence: either asylum, an effort board upwards or a place of entertainment while waiting for a better opportunity.
Few people think they're dying there, and as death approaches, many plan to return to their homeland.
In the popular cities of migrants, disproportionately large numbers of people born and temporarily staying abroad live, and in them death and return to their country of origin continue to work.
An estimated 20% of the dead in South Florida are being transported elsewhere, which is more than anywhere else in the United States.
Most human remains (HR, short form of professional lantern, human remains) are transported to their home country from the international airport of Miami.
Since 1964, the largest company in the sector, the CEO, says that about 80% of this traffic is going abroad. The company is flying bodies to several destinations in Central and South America and to several countries in Europe.

The more immigrants move to popular cities, the more they die there.
Even after death, returning home has its own cost.
Miami is the main airport for Latin American flights of American Airlines, and the figures in the table describe the human remains that the airline has returned to its home country in 2013.
The return of bodies to the country of origin is not cheap: prices can range from five to five hundred to thousands of dollars.
The religious, cultural and public health requirements associated with the flight and delivery of human remains also vary.
Migrant communities in cities that are preferred by migrants sometimes organise funeral communities to help with costs, because the return of bodies is expensive, the government does not help in the process, and the dead are often young people who do not have insurance.
A number of credit institutions and informal health insurance schemes have once come from such communities, founded by Italian, Jewish, and Greek, the first American immigrant groups in New York.
The new generations of Mexican, Chinese, Philippines and Bangladeshi immigrants now operate in many of their popular cities.

Death abroad always causes difficulties, as few people who have moved abroad plan to make the immigrant city their last resting place.
For example, in Dubai, for foreigners who died without a will, the Sharia Act is respected even if the laws on the recovery of the deceased’s home country were different.
The entire property shall be frozen and subsequently distributed in accordance with the judgment of the Sharia Court.
The network of Aer Lingus, which is central to Dublin, carries human remains (
2013) the scale reflects the multi-cultural population structure of the city and the Irish.
The airline interrupted the service but resumed it in 2004, after obtaining negative feedback from those who had left the country.
The idea of death is rarely present when a person passes through a city that is preferred by migrants or when he lives there.
On the contrary, temporary or permanent migration to the immigrant city is an open declaration of the immigrant’s way of looking at life, not death.
Death in a foreign city of immigrants, however, means making the strongest and most irreversible decisions — decisions whether to belong to a local or global community, to a universe or to a country, to a short-term or eternal.
The Centre and the Left Alliance will ask a mid-term question on inequality.
The opposition parties intend to ask the government about the income of the low incomes and the growth of inequality.
The parties want to stimulate the debate on people's income problems, which are exacerbated by poor economic development and rising unemployment.
The growing inequality is also seen between the different parts of the country and within the large cities, and the parties point out in their communications.
In the government's budget next year, cuts and tax increases are directed at low incomes, such as students, the unemployed and pensioners, family and ordinary employed, while, among other things, food, medicines and housing continue to increase.
In fact, nearly half a million people are already unemployed, and the parties say so in their communications.
The problems of living in employment have also deteriorated.
The parliamentary groups of the Centre and the Left Union will discuss the matter on Thursday.
The third opposition party's fundamental Finns have already announced that they have tabled an interim question on the resources of the police and internal security.
The Parliamentary autumn session starts tomorrow Tuesday.
The West Indian Day parade of New York City is about to begin
Caribbean culture once again gets to light in New York City, where the West Indian Day parade is one of the biggest outdoor events of the year, and there also politicians see one another and become visible.
The annual parade will be held in Brooklyn on Monday.
It cares for the celebration of traditional Carnivals prior to fasting, and some of them are dancers who wear complex, often feather - made suits.
Eric Adams, president of the Brooklyn region, is the festival champion of this year, but many other political faces are also expected.
The parade is an excellent opportunity for present and candidate politicians to welcome the public a week before the pre-elections.
Despite the celebrations, the parade weekend has also been a part of violence in previous years.
The police have said that they are seeking to keep the event safe through additional measures, including by monitoring the activities of the nearby gangs.
Do you even want to ask rhetorical questions?
Everyone knows the rhetorical questions, don't they?
You shouldn't answer that question.
This figure of speech, i.e. a question that is not expected to be answered, but which suggests a certain answer, is a taste of both high-flying words and a more daily exchange of words.
The opening words of Ciceron's famous Catilina prosecution are chain rhetorical questions, the first of which is: "How long, O Catilina, are you going to take advantage of our patience?"
The same is true of the questions my wife has asked: "Oh, why shouldn't I warm up five days old chicken for children?"
Why are you so tense?
Eroticism is a better word for a rhetorical question.
The force of the rhetorical question lies in the fact that the issue is open and the public is encouraged to accept it.
A mysteriously rhetorical question gives us the impression that no one entirely sane could agree with that.
In the 19th century, author David Williams described the rhetorical question "some of the spoken words that are wonderfully designed to produce a strong feeling of truth about a subject, while at the same time the challenge presented by them is impossible to disagree".
Skilling skills
Retorical questions can be asked afterwards if you want to achieve more ambitious goals.
A number of retrospect questions, designed to express grief or irritation, are called epileptics.
For example, Job uses them to appeal to the Almighty: "What do you profit from repressing me --?"
Do you have eyes like ours?
Do you see it the same way a person sees it?
The chain of rhetorical questions can also be found in my wife's comments: "Why did you cause food poisoning for children?
Are you out of your mind?
Can't you do anything right?
In addition, there is a so-called "hypophora", which is what happens when you ask a question and you answer it yourself immediately.
Isaac Hayes offers an excellent example of this: "Who is the black private egg that is a sexual fear for all women?
Parru!
That's right!
Who would sacrifice their lives for their brother?
Give examples of my wife: "What is the only food that children have eaten and where have they been able to get sick?"
This chicken.
What idiot fed it to them?
You.
Strangely enough, the rhetorical question is not usually trying to persuade, even though rhetoric is a skill of bending.
If you are trying to talk to someone around instead of trying to preach to the already converted ones or become fascinated by someone’s stubbornness, you should use rhetorical questions in a sustainable way.
They are more useful in trying to reconcile opinions than in trying to get one to accept one’s own opinion.
If the public agrees with the argument "And it's not nice when it's so sunny out there," the rhetorical question tells us that the speaker is sure of what he says that binds the speaker and the public better together.
However, this will only happen if the speaker is sure that there are no differences of opinion.
By assuming that consensus has been reached rather than seeking consensus, the speaker can seem, well, self-righteous.
In other situations, the rhetorical question refers to a weak argument.
In the headlines of the magazines, the rhetorical question is too often the strongest possible argument in a very weak case: "Did the aliens build the pyramids?"
In both cases, the risk is that the question may lead to an answer which differs from the suggested answer.
"Are you thinking the same way we are?" was part of the British Conservative Party's risky campaign statement in the general elections in 2005.
The party's gone.
For some, finding such cases has become a hobby, and the so-called QTAIN questions (the concept made known by the British journalist John Rentoul) Questions To Which Answer Is No, the questions for which the answer is no, are popular.
A few years ago, a friend of mine held a competition looking for the best examples.
The competition was clearly won by the song "Do You Wanna Be In My Gang?", which was sang by pop star Gary Glitter before he became a sexual abuser of children.
The author has also written the book "You Talkin' to Me?"
Researcher: The time of the federal compromise may be over
At the beginning of the conflict, it was still thought in many countries that the federal state could be some kind of compromise on the conflict, says Saari.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier in the Russian canal interview that getting peace in Eastern Ukraine calls for discussions on the state status of the region.
In practice, this would mean some form of self-government for Eastern Ukraine.
According to Putin, it would protect the legal rights of those living in the East.
According to the island, the transformation of Ukraine into a federal state is, in a certain way, a priority for Russia's aims.
Ukraine certainly has every reason to suspect that Russia would thereby seek to influence the internal policy of Ukraine, he says.
If the federal resolution is not reached, the second option could be some kind of frozen conflict from the Russian point of view, where Russia would practically control Luhansk and Donetsk, the Saari estimates.
West and Ukraine have accused Russia of sending weapons and soldiers to the east.
Russia has denied claims, even though, for example, the Russian-minded rebels themselves have said that their troops have fought 'free Russian soldiers on leave'.
Director of the Top: An influential task for Katainen
The brickman reminds me that the job image is new and is still envisioning.
In his view, the idea is that Katainen, in some way, would coordinate or even lead to the Commission's work on competitiveness and employment.
Of course, one of the priorities of the Commission's new programme for the period is the competitiveness and employment of the Union.
That is how we are at the heart of the Commission, says Tiilikainen.
It believes that Katainen's background, economic know-how and role in the economic crisis will give him the opportunity to play a good role within the Commission.
According to the plans, the task would be portfolioless, i.e. Katainen would not have his own Directorate-General under his command.
Instead, Kataina would be a team leader in the EU's competitiveness and employment sector, which would allow her to have other portfolios, not just the Economic Commissioner's portfolio, for coordination purposes.
In practice, running a team could mean, for example, planning and steering.
Mothers of soldiers: in Ukraine up to 15,000 Russian soldiers
According to the Russian Military Mothers' Association, up to 15,000 Russian soldiers have been sent to Ukraine in the last two months, and over 7 000 Russian soldiers are currently in the country.
According to human rights organisations, at least 200 Russian soldiers have died.
According to the organization, the hospital in Rostov, near the Ukrainian border, is filled with wounded in the Ukrainian war.
The mothers of soldiers collect their information from the soldiers' families.
NATO has estimated that there are over a thousand Russian soldiers in Ukraine.
BB-Andte of his alcohol use: "After a little drink, there's a case."
Big Brother Jussi and Andte got into thinking about the life of the BB house on Monday night.
Jussi, who was on the basement, rode a fitness bike on Monday night with Andte, who belonged to the people of Kartano.
The twin wondered what the programme viewers thought they were doing.
Not until you've seen it, Andte said.
According to Juss, most of the time in the BB house is waiting and spending.
Possible parties or tasks form only a fraction of the life of the BB House.
It's more like waiting and wondering and talking and living.
Ande, Anne and Jussi.
The people of the Cartano spent the evenings in wet signs on Wednesday, and alcohol was especially on Andte’s phone.
Jussi asked Andtel if the party had made a man’s life more meaningful now that he was able to talk to other residents in a small hippo.
I'll have a little drink, and then we'll have a case, Andte admitted.
Watch Andte interview on ISTV video!
Let Abreu reveal his body's desire in Me Women
Anna Abreu tells me in Me Women's magazine that she decided to lose weight two years ago when she was on a job break.
At that time, tired Anna thought with her weight loss that she would gain more energy.
Fred Montana / Split News
Give me a dream a few years ago about a body of Victoria's Secret models.
My body design was like Victoria's Secret.
I wanted to look good, and I thought I wanted to lose weight, so Anna tells the paper.
Anna, who is presenting her body with performances and music videos, says that she is not a covetousist, even though she has been called such.
Viena Kytöjoki
A guy who's fine in Tim's room, Anna's training in the gym, and he's doing boxing.
The visible muscles are not important to me, but that I gain a certain weight with the gym, Anna points out.
Sometimes the pop star allows itself to be delicious.
If I do, I really do.
Sometimes I pull out unhealthy, and I don't think if there's another kilo.
Instead, I was wondering what my body was thinking.
I'm sick of it if I do something bad to my body.
Stress Upper
Anna says she likes her body.
The distribution of profits pleases shareholders but does not increase growth
Did Australian listed companies today just try to please a large crowd by agreeing to shareholders’ wishes for greater profit distribution and buy back their shares?
Is the decision-making power moving from corporate governments to shareholders served by the government?
The most important distribution of profits was made last week at the end of the reporting period 2014.
The prices of shares in companies which have rewarded investors in the form of buy-back programmes and which have increased profits have increased clearly.
And there's nothing wrong with it.
The reverse of the coin, however, is that capital consumption is falling faster than the analysts have predicted, and this fact causes many to ask whether too much emphasis will be placed on short-term popularity and whether there will be sufficient focus on growth in the near future and in the long term.
Of course, some companies return money to shareholders and finance business by other means.
For example, more funding will be obtained from cheap stock markets.
From the point of view of the company, this makes sense because the loan is currently cheaper, whereas the capital is not.
However, even if the funds acquired from the loan market were not taken into account, it is clear that the advantage towards the shareholders is financed above all by the company's use of less money to invest.
The net result of this wave of purchasing programmes (and withdrawal of profit investment plans) is a decrease in capital on the Australian market.
Credit Suisse calls this reporting period "the decrease in capital", during which companies have tried to keep the number of shares low.
As part of the same plan, companies have fewer capital.
At the end of the reporting period, the value of the repurchase programmes was $3.7 billion and the value of the unrealised capital procurement programmes expected was 1.5 billion.
Credit Suisse has gone so far as to view capital consumption as a curse in one of the titles of its report.
Although we now have figures that confirm that such a trend exists, there has been informal evidence for months.
Glenn Stevens, Governor of the Australian Central Bank, considered it sufficient to point out a few weeks ago that companies need a little more "combat spirit" to increase investment.
Stevens is not concerned about the future of individual companies, but about the overall impact on the economy, as consumption of low capital generally leads to negative consequences for economic growth and employment.
It is said from Credit Suisse that "the reporting companies' own estimates of their capital consumption have decreased by an average of four per cent over the previous two years.
The average increase in free cash flow is 2 %.
Improving cash flow is likely to increase capital consumption.
This quick look is good from the point of view of current shareholders and the stock market, but it is also some kind of proof of the obedience of companies.
If I could get a coin every time the CEO said that the short-term price of the stock is not important, I would... well, the end of the sentence is easy to guess.
Of course, this argument is not true.
The CEOs follow the stock prices very closely and are very concerned about price fluctuations.
The short and long-term bonus packages of suppliers are defined according to the value of the shares, and the position of managers depends on them.
The CEOs would like to say that some decisions, whether they are business, increased investment in an organisation or profit-sharing, are not always immediately popular, but they are useful for the medium-term strategy.
In fact, business managers often complain about the fact that there is a very short-term approach to the investment market.
Therefore, the current supply of conservativeness seems to be agreed on short-term objectives.
However, in the reporting period that has just ended, it was too clear that the emphasis was on reducing the consumption of future capital and that the most economical companies were praised.
The large mining companies, such as BHP and Rio Tinto, held the number one player in reducing capital consumption, but also many other companies are doing the same – part of the necessity and part of the fear that the shareholders would react.
Why, then, do investors put pressure on companies to share profits?
According to the Credit Suisse strategicist Hasa Tevfik, it is clear that shareholders want more income, as profits for other, more traditional fixed-income investment products have decreased, as the global interest rates have suddenly fallen to bring more money to the market.
In this way, investors have been forced to look for profits on the capital market and in turn they are putting pressure on companies to share more profits.
Shareholders have also made it quite clear to companies that they are not willing to invest in high-risk companies whose profit distribution is uncertain.
Investors would prefer the money as more and more investors approach the retirement age.
The statistics for the previous reporting period clearly show that profit distribution was greatly affected by corporate cost cuts and not by the increase in turnover.
Public nudity leaks appear to be data searching or breaking into an e-mail account
Jennifer Lawrence's photos and, according to some sources, an unknown hacker leaking videos into the Internet amazes information security experts and Apple.
Although a hacker in a chatroom has published lists of female publicity persons and said that he has more pictures of women, some of those described have reported that their images are counterfeit, while others have said that they were long since removed.
There are a lot of filmed and it has been said to include Jennifer Lawrence, Jenny McCarthy, Rihanna, Kate Upton and American actor Mary E Winstead.
After hacking, the biggest question is what was done through the attack.
What about the pictures and videos that were real and where they were downloaded from?
The most visible source of images – shameless and thorough attack on Apple's iCloud service – is the most unlikely option.
Big companies such as Apple have invested in inside-house security teams, whose task is to attempt to penetrate the company's own systems regularly.
"A large scale hacking into Apple's iCloud service is unlikely.
Furthermore, the original publisher does not claim that the claim should be correct", notes Rik Ferguson, Vice-President of the Information Security Research Unit of Trend Micro.
A simpler and more likely explanation for these hacks related to the public (and for those dealing with fewer people every day) is the leaking of the e-mail address and password, either by guessing or falsifying information, i.e. by scamming a person to log in to a website that looks real, and then using this information against them.
Apple continues to investigate the alleged attack on the iCloud service used on iPhone phones to store settings and above all to copy images when transferred to the cloud server.
You can log in to the user's account via iCloud service by providing this email address and password, and then download their images and other information from the account.
This can only be prevented if the Account Holder has introduced two-stage authentication ("two-factor authentication", 2FA), i.e. an additional protection against intruding in an account, in which case a code will be sent to the Account Holder's mobile phone before the account can be entered.
However, it is relatively rare to use 2FA properties either because it is not known or because it is considered to be difficult.
Apple will continue to examine whether all the information is based on its iCloud service and, if so, how widely user accounts were penetrated.
The company has not delivered an opinion on this matter at the time of publication of the original version of this text.
Ferguson considers it possible that the hacker has used the "forget the password" link in Apple's iCloud service by collecting first the e-mail addresses of the individuals, for example, from the address book of the second hacked device.
It is also possible that celebrities have used the same password in several services, when passwords were captured through them.
The publisher of Lawrence's photos claims that the pictures are real, but he won't tell us when they're taken.
Winstead said in his Tweet that it could be a long-term hacking attempt.
These pictures were removed a long time ago, so I can only imagine how long this took a terrible effort.
I feel sympathy for all others who were hacked," he wrote in his Tweet.
However, independent IT expert Graham Cluley points out that Winstead may have thought that he had removed the images from his mobile phone, but removing the image from the modern smartphone does not always mean that there is no copy of the image.
Modern smartphones regularly store images in a cloud service because they often do not have space for a large number of images taken by the user.
Apple's iPhone standard is to save images to iCloud; Google Android uses Google+ and Microsoft's Windows phones to save images to OneDrive.
Independent service providers, such as Dropbox, provide automatic image and data storage services.
"People take and remove pictures, but they don't understand that the images are being downloaded from the account," Cluley says to The Guardian.
Ferguson agrees: "The deleted does not always mean deleted", he says.
Images and videos can be saved for years.
If someone has access to the user's email address and password, they can reload all the images and videos sent by email.
You can download images from Apple's service to your Mac, Windows PC or any Apple device.
The hacker published a screenshot claimed to display videos and images taken from Windows PC, which are not yet published.
Two-stage authentication protects against such hacking because it requires anyone who tries to copy an existing account to another device to provide the original user with the code, usually sent to a mobile phone.
Without the code, access to the account will be prevented.
Both Apple, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo offer two-stage authentication for the account, but it is not yet known whether these individuals used the service or how many of them used it.
Some have said that the images they claim to be are not real.
The representative of Ariana Grande has said that the images in which Grande is claimed to be are "fully counterfeit".
Victoria Justice wrote in her Tweet: "I have taken nude pictures of you, you don't understand.
Let me break the roots of the rumors to the very beginning.
Cluley brings out another option.
Because of the fact that the hacking was aimed at individuals in the public domain, someone may have broken into their accounts who managed their social media accounts or regularly managed their e-mails.
"I would like to know whether the actors' agencies or any representative are involved," he wonders.
However, those persons shall not use the same publisher or agency.
Another option is that someone who installed or helped the victim to configure one or more systems and secretly changed the system so that all information could be returned.
This was true in the case of Christopher Chaney, who was named "Hollywood Hacker" in Florida, where the hacker distributed images from Scarlett Johansson's and Mila Kunis' e-mail accounts in 2011, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison in December 2012. He was also ordered to pay over $66,000 in damages.
Chaney was accused of secretly entering the e-mail accounts of over 50 people in the entertainment industry between November 2010 and October 2011. In one case, he asked Aguilera for pictures of the star in the name of this stylist, and then published them online.
Later on, Chaney apologized, saying that his actions "are certainly one of the worst violations of privacy that you can imagine".
Chaney was also claimed to spy on two people online for more than ten years.
According to Cluley, "In the case of Chaney, the e-mail accounts of the stars were hacked and changed so that someone sent their information even after the password was changed".
Cluley says that the obsessive action of hackers breaking into these accounts "remembers the gathering of butterflies".
They just want to collect this kind of information.
It is possible that in this case someone had encountered a list of the information and login details of these accounts in services such as Dropbox.
Hackers have also been able to try to intrude for a long time.
or they had access to the information of an e-mail account, such as the address book, and then they fished on the information of other persons.
I don't think it's a simple iCloud security breach.
Australia has offered its intelligence service to help the UN track down 44 peacekeepers who were kidnapped by Al-Qaida-related terrorists in Syria.
The terrorist group, Jabhat al-Nusra, is believed to have been held captive by 44 Fijian peacekeepers, who took over the crossing point on the Golan hills last week and forced UN forces to surrender.
The Peacekeepers have been missing since Wednesday, and there are no data on where they are.
At the same time, ministers from the United Nations Conference on Small Developing Islands, including Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, are very concerned about what has happened.
Bishop discussed the situation with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Mon at the summit, and he has offered Australia's help to rescue the missing peacekeepers.
"I have assured Australia will help the UN in everything it can by providing, for example, intelligence services," she said to the AAP news service from Samoa on Monday.
We have very close contact with all the intelligence network partners and friends -- to ensure that we can locate them and that they're safe.
Bishop has already assured the Prime Minister of Fiji, Frank Baiimarama, and the Foreign Minister, Ratu Inoke Kubuabola, that Australia is using its position in the UN Security Council to monitor the situation.
At the same time, the Philippines peacekeeping group held captive in their military cashiers was reported to have escaped in various parts of the same controversial area.
The UN has been monitoring the hills of Golan since the outbreak of the fire in Syria and Israel in 1974.
The fraudsters are trying to steal your money through a carbon tax cancellation initiative, warning the Australian Competition Authority ACCC
The fraudsters are using the carbon tax repeal initiative to steal money, the ACCC warns.
The SCAMwatch unit of the Competition Authority has warned consumers and businesses not to rely on the over-sounding offers of government agencies offering thousands of dollars in credit.
The fraudsters may use the figures in the media to prove to the consumer how much they can save when buying goods after the carbon tax has been abolished, and offering them up to $7,000, the warning says.
The fraudsters may sound very convincing because they have examined the victim’s personal data that they use when trying to obtain bank information or when trying to get the victim to pay the reward.
They're discussing current topics to trick the victim.
Cheaters use more than a carbon tax evasion to get their hands on money. Their stories are more advanced, and they use up timely things to build a scam around them.
Also, the MH370 aircraft lost on the flight of Malaysian Airlines and the death of Robin Williams are inspired by fraud.
The ACCC instructs the company to contact the company itself by means of the personalised contact information instead of the contact information provided by the caller, if there is any doubt as to the identity of the caller representing the company.
If you receive an unexpected call or email from someone who claims to represent an agency or a company such as an energy company, and according to which you are entitled to compensation for the cancellation of the carbon tax, beware.
If you believe that you have been deceived and gave personal information or transferred money to a fraud account, contact your bank immediately.
If the offer sounds too good to be true – for example, free money shared by the government – it is likely to be.
Economic messages: Lipponen blames the EU's Russian sanctions
The former Prime Minister, Paavo Lipponen, criticises the sanctions imposed by the EU on Russia in the context of an interview with economic messages.
Russia's priority in politics is to pursue its own interests.
The sanctions do not necessarily work," Lipponen says in the interview.
Lipponen has started his work as a business explorer of the EC's Arctic regions.
He is concerned that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) suspended their Russian project funding as part of the EU's financial sanctions.
"It means, for example, that environmental projects with clear vision of the northern dimension go to the ice," Lipponen says in the interview.
The freezing of funding is now detrimental to cooperation, which Lipposen believes can be difficult to rebuild if there is no trust.
However, he believes that the interest of Finnish companies in cooperation projects in the Arctic region will continue to be as high as in the past.
He is currently reporting to the EC on Finland's Arctic policy and business opportunities in the north.
This will not be affected by the situation in Ukraine or Russia.
The report looks far ahead, talking about tens of years," he says.
It is rare that the norpe comes into or near the water, states nature pedagogical Vesa Heinonen Museum of Pohjanmaa.
On Sunday, in the Suvilahti of Vaasa, an elephant was seen swimming near the beach.
According to Heinos, the norm is likely to have come after the summer meal.
It's not crazy.
This means there's fish in the area, Heinonen's tip.
According to him, especially in spring and autumn, the Sundom Bridge sees Norpes, which arrive right after the fish.
However, Norppa is not a common species in the real sea area of Vaasa.
You see an elephant in the country, at the villas' offices, he goes on.
Norppia lives, among other things, in the Gulf Sea and the Archipelago Sea.
According to the court of South Australia, a murdered pizzeria owner Robert Vallelonga behaved aggressively and violently outside the nightclub
Murdered South Australian pizzeria owner Robert Vallelona.
In a court hearing, it has come to light that Robert Vallelonga, who owns the pizzeria, behaved aggressively against his partner and security officer only minutes before he was killed outside the nightclub.
The lawyers charged with the murder of Vallelonga, in the lower court of Adelaide, requested the release of their client against guarantees because it was "clear" self-defence.
Marie Shaw, QC, said that the case was not serious enough to keep his client, whose identity has not been published, behind bars until the trial.
"According to the evidence, the dead behaved so aggressively that he had to be removed from the nightclub," he said.
After that, this 40-year-old drunk man began to tear off a security guard's shirt.
It is important to note that, according to the prosecutor, death was caused by one stroke, which clearly indicates self-defence or self-defence.
So far, a 25-year-old man is being accused of killing.
Vallelonga, 44, was found unconscious near the border between Rundle St and Synagogue Place at about 2.25 p.m. on May 4th.
He died of injuries at the Royal Adela's hospital early the next day. Friends and pizzeria customers died of one Tree Hill's "local legend".
According to the prosecutors, there was no reason to kill the accused, and after the incident he had told the cab driver that he had put someone to sleep for a few days.
But now the video of the security camera proves something else, Shaw says.
"It confirms that the dead behaved aggressively -- his partner tried to calm him down and got his own share of the hard and violent behavior," he says.
Our client has both a presumption of innocence and evidence that he defended himself, which will be mentioned in the trial.
The prosecutors opposed the release of the man because only one of the three security officers on the scene on the night of the crash had been involved in the operation of Vallelonga.
They said that other security guards didn't think he was a threat, because "it was short" and he used a big man's vocabulary because he wanted to avoid physical clashes.
They said that the cab driver who saw the case clearly would also prove that Vallelonga was hit "strongly" and he had no chance to defend himself.
Judge Elizabeth Sheppard ordered the man to be arrested until the next week when he would declare his decision.
A controversial dolphin hunt began in Japan - justified as a tradition - Foreign news - The Evening Sanomat
It was expected that bad weather would largely delay the start of bad hunting in the world.
In the Japanese city of Taiji, the annual dolphin hunting season started again on Monday.
It is expected to last until the end of February.
Among other things, the British magazine, Guardian, tells of the great opposition to the yachts that have been part of the world.
In the yacht, hunters drive hundreds of dolphins into a remote bay where mammals are slaughtered after being selected from among the most suitable individuals for transport to dolphins and theme parks around the world.
The dolphin meat also ends up in food.
However, according to the local authorities, the start of the hunt was expected to be delayed due to poor weather.
The practice was disseminated to the world in 2009 with a documentary film called The Cove.
During the previous hunting seasons, hunters have criticised not only animal farmers but also diplomats.
According to the opponents, dolphin meat in any case has a limited market due to its high mercury content.
According to those who defend hunting, including the Japanese Government, this is a tradition.
Defenceists have also reminded us that dolphins are not threatened.
During the weekend, the dolphin hunt was opposed by demonstrations in several countries.
According to protests in Tokyo, hunting harms Japan’s reputation in the world.
A demonstration was also held in Helsinki on Monday in front of the Japanese Embassy.
Part of NATO's Member States are uncertain about the deployment of new troops in Eastern Europe
Within NATO, the military alliance shares views as to whether NATO should be set up in Eastern Europe and the Baltics in response to the crisis in Ukraine, says the Financial Times.
Poland and Estonia have asked the military union to bring permanent troops into their countries, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel has opposed the plan.
"Ukraine has given a new perspective on Russian policy and is threatening to bring down European security," Michael Clarke, Director of the Royal United Services Institute in London, told the Financial Times.
The NATO member states are meeting in the beginning of the week, and the military union is due to publish its new preparedness plans.
The key question of the plan is whether NATO can breach the TAE Convention on conventional weapons signed in 1990.
That's where the NATO and Warsaw alliance agreed on how they're putting the armed forces in the Atlantic-Ural Mountains.
In practice, according to the Financial Times, the agreement prevents new military bases in Eastern Europe and the Baltics.
Russia itself frozen its participation in the agreement in 2007, but the country did not actually withdraw from the agreement.
In view of the tightening situation in Ukraine, NATO wonders whether the terms of the agreement still need to be complied with.
"Nato resources must be available in all the NATO countries that need resources," said Sir Malcolm Rifkind, Chairman of the British Parliament Security Committee, Financial Times.
Matt Guthmiller the youngest around the world
When other teenagers learned how to drive, Matt Guthmiller learned how to fly.
The 19-year-old Guthmiller has just flown around the world – and yet alone, reports CBS News correspondent Carter Evans.
A young man in South Dakota flew 30,000 miles 23 times in 15 different countries in five different continents.
On his journey Guthmiller was treated like a rock star because of his record flight performance.
Guthmiller also heard critical comments:
"It's too risky" and "some spoiled, rich kid just wants to see a little world and have fun."
Guthmiller did not have much to say to those who made such comments.
Of course, I enjoyed a lot of fun, but it also included a lot of work, and I hope that my record will also inspire other people to go to the world and do great things.
Guthmiller's interest in the flight started when he was young, and first he asked his parents to eat in the cafes at the airports.
Later, he insisted on getting to the flight classes.
My parents let me on a short 20-dollar tour, but I think they thought it would stop.
It didn't stop.
Soon thereafter Guthmiller entered into an agreement with his parents to give him more time in the cab.
I agreed to share a car with my father all the time in high school instead of getting my own car.
I could fly planes at the trade.
By the age of 17, Guthmiller had received a flight licence and two years later he leased a single-engine Beechcraft for his flight alone around the world.
A young man who attended MIT-high school personally managed the aircraft and made fuel calculations.
For several hours in the upper class, he also meant that he himself needed an extra refueling...
In practice, a lot of caffeine and Oreos cookies.
Guthmiller says he ate a couple of cookies completely during a long flight.
Flying into the clouds was both awesome and scary.
Air traffic controllers in other countries had no regulations to help them navigation around the storms.
I had no idea which of the clouds were just slightly above the plane and which of them reached the height of 45,000 feet and tore the plane apart.
Guthmiller's plane was not pressurised and had no oxygen reserve, so he couldn't fly above the clouds.
The amount of fuel in the plane would never have reached a higher level.
On the day after the interview, another young pilot, 17-year-old Haris Suleman, died on a plane between Samoa and Hawaii, which Guthmiller calls the most difficult part of his journey.
Guthmiller flew from the same airport as Suleman, and he felt that the take-up phase is technically challenging because of the large amount of fuel needed for a 16-hour flight.
Despite the risks and even the high-end comb, Guthmiller managed to break the record and raise money for the ATK training via the Code.org site.
He's the coder himself, and he set up his own company at the age of 12.
Guthmiller's goals lie in the sky.
I'd love to start the next Apple, but let's see what happens now.
In any case, Guthmiller's going to aim high.
Aim for the sky and you can achieve something great.
Finding a real rancher is harder than you think.
Lori Joyce was excited when fans lined up his Cupcakes by Heather and Lori stores around Canada after Canada’s W TV channel started showing The Cupcake Girls tosi TV in 2009.
The excitement continued until it became clear that one of the Francisian entrepreneurs was not the right one to do the job.
"My ranchist sat in his car and called me, "a hundred potential customers waiting outside the store to buy a cup of cake, and he can't handle the situation," Joyce says.
This event opened my eyes because it was a huge lost opportunity for us.
After what happened, Joyce decided to change the selection process of the Francise partners from the point of view of stressing the company's culture-like management skills instead of the bakery skills.
"Whoever can shine in an interview -- they know what I want to hear," he says, adding that he's had about a hundred interviews for every 11 Francises.
We will start with six weeks of training, but the workers will operate in a completely different way in the working environment themselves, so the whole process will be quite difficult.
Finding the right Francisian entrepreneur is vital to the development of any small business.
A strong and honest manager is able to edit and grow the organization, while a poorly-managed manager can cause costly damage to the company.
"before I thought that looking for a Francisian entrepreneur would be like going out on a date, but it's not true at all, you can do a lot of things to get to know someone before you get married," Joyce says.
On the other hand, in the case of a Francisian partner, a sustainable agreement will be signed, a security will be obtained and a new shop will be built.
Making a partnership with someone before you see how a person works is a huge step forward and a significant test of confidence.
The symbiotic relationship between the French parties is similar to a strong marriage, because they have common goals, explains Lorraine McLachlan, chairman and CEO of the Canadian Francise Association (CFA).
That is why McLachlan believes that the French entrepreneur should also be careful when choosing the future French donor before entering into such a long-term partnership.
"This is the same idea as human relationships: if a dating partner is rude already on a date, imagine what he's like in a marriage?" he says.
It is equally important for both parties to choose carefully and assess the future contractual partner and to draw attention to the smallest alarm signs on either side.
Mr McLachlan adds that the French givers like Joyce can learn from past successes and mistakes, but for the first time those who act as a French giver must be more careful when choosing the first, most important partners.
In the light of the alleged successful parent company, it is necessary for new French donors to conclude what challenges they have had to face and what skills the new Francisian entrepreneur needs when faced with similar difficulties.
For the first time, companies acting as a Francise-anator may also ask for the assistance of a Francise advisor to create a profile based on practices in the sector.
McLachlan also points out that for the first time, there is a great deal of help available to those who work as a Francisian giver and entrepreneur on the CFA website at ochforafranchise.ca.
However, the process will be made easier later, as the Francisans learned to assess potential entrepreneurs better, but also because the first Francisans can give advice and help in the evaluation.
"The work of the first Francisese partner helped Brian (founder and CEO of Scudamore, 1-800 GOT-JUNK?) significantly in the process of creating the company and the Francise system," says Erik Church, operational director of O2E Brands. O2E Brands includes companies 1-800 GOT-JUNK?, You Move Me and Wow 1 Day Painting.
The Francise entrepreneurs helped Brian create something he couldn't have created alone, so the first Francise entrepreneurs have to choose this idea in mind.
Under Church there are 216 Francise entrepreneurs who represent all three brands of O2E and are also You Move Me's French partner in Toronto.
The Chruch's method of finding the right Francise partner is simple.
"The trust test we're using is to ask ourselves, " Should I invite this person to my weekend barbecue?" he says.
"If the answer to this question is 'I', you probably don't want to spend much of your working day with them looking for solutions to major business challenges."
Church also points out that O2E Brands is, to a large extent, a thank you for its success.
In a business organisation, managers often see their position as a short-term and lower level of management as very formal, whereas in a long-term partnership, the French entrepreneurs are more committed to the success of the company.
"The French partnership has much more positive sides than the traditional business structure, but the partnership is much more intensive," he says.
This is a partnership, not a relationship between the Vice-President and the local operational director.
Such a partnership is more difficult, but if well-managed, it will produce better results.
Rail delays lower cereals prices in the north of the United States
Delayed train transport has led to a significant fall in cereal prices in the north of the United States, weeks before a huge harvest is expected to put the transport network under new pressure.
Commercial grain silts in the state of North Dakota offer farmers only $2.7 per Bushel - about a dollar less than the control prices - mainly due to the cost of ensuring the capacity of the rails to be received, the merchants and the agricultural organisations say.
IN Raw materials
The most acute problems are the BNSF railways of Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway and Canadian Pacific railways.
The federal railway supervisor will conduct a consultation on service problems on Thursday.
The northern plains have to rely on railways for the transport of agricultural products, as they are far from river networks.
The delay in rail transport increased as a result of a very cold winter in 2013, resulting in the slowing and shortening of trains.
Some farmers believe that the increased transport of crude oil from the North Dakota Bakken oil sludge formation has eliminated the transport of cereals, which is not true according to the railway companies.
According to the manager of an international grain trading company, the costs of storing and transporting suppliers to ensure the use of the train have risen from zero to up to $2,000 per wagon per year.
Someone's got to pay the costs.
"These costs are paid either by the farmer or by the customer," the director of the grain trade company says.
The US Agriculture Agency estimates that North Dakota will grow by more than a third and 16% in the spring crop harvest.
The President of the National Grain and Feed Association, Randy Gordon, says that "we are normally trying to start a new harvest on a clean table, which means that enough storage space has been exhausted for the harvest and the grain has been sold and moved.
Now, however, we are starting late because of the service problems of the trains last year.
The railway company BNSF has assured its customers and supervisors that it will handle the transport of this year's harvest smoothly.
John Miller, Vice-President of BNSF, responsible for the transport of agricultural products, said that the company has reduced the amount of long-term transport (rail wagons ordered by customers for more than four days) from the beginning of April to 16 500, to around two thousand.
"We have moved almost everything from the old harvest we were supposed to move," says Miller, referring to the remaining grain from the previous harvest.
However, the latest reported speeds of the BNSF grain trains were 9 per cent lower than in the second quarter of last year, which is a sign of congestion.
Miller acknowledges that the development is "unbalanced", but noted that the company is currently investing $5 billion in capital this year in order to improve the handling capacity of all types of transportable products, such as grain congestion.
The speeds of the Canadian Pacific railways, which had problems due to another sum, are 11 per cent lower than in the same year, but clearly higher than the low speeds of the early year.
The Canadian Pacific railway company has told the Railway Inspector (Surface Transport Board) that the changes made to its system of ordering trains should improve its capacity to deal with traffic in the coming harvest of 15-20%.
"The action plan for the autumn of the Canadian Pacific railway company focuses on the continuous improvement of the speed of trains and the efficient exploitation of trains, so that we can deliver more and more trains every week", said the railway company's representative.
The Ukrainian crisis may solve NATO's "identity crisis"
Major country leaders, diplomats and experts have often been concerned about NATO's future and whether the conclusion of NATO's Afghanistan mission will also end with NATO itself.
However, this concern is very premature, as can be seen at the NATO Summit in Wales Cardiff this week, involving 60 leaders, including the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama.
The mandate list of politicians and diplomats is not limited to the crises of the world, even to the extent that the departure of Afghan troops, which was once the prime minister, is no longer the most important thing.
On the other hand, 28 states' alliances are needed once Russia has re-infiltrated Ukraine, which is a shocking reminder that the threat to Europe's independence is not necessarily just part of the past.
World leaders are looking for new ways to punish Russia, but they will also move troops, promise more money for defence expenditure and recommitment to defence co-operation.
In some ways, NATO has to thank Vladimir Putin.
"It (NATO) was looking for its purpose in some way -- and it had a fairly significant identity crisis in progress," says Heather Conley, Head of the European programme of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
NATO has not only found a new purpose, but it has also strengthened.
Obama has also added a new task to the agenda.
The President of the United States has promised to try and get world leaders to create a common strategy for the rapid defeat of the Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.
According to official opinions, the President will face important challenges in trying to inspire his conflict-satisfied partners to provide a military response, especially to a situation that would cross the border from Iraq to Syria.
However, President Obama is under pressure to demonstrate that he is leading the world to find a strategy to overcome extremist Islamics, first of all saying that "we do not have a strategy".
Western experts have set cautious expectations for the summit on whether breakthroughs will be achieved in Ukraine or in the Islamic State in the course of discussions.
Additional economic sanctions are planned as the main penalty for an event called the Ukrainian attack on Russia.
The officials of the European Union dealt with the issue this weekend, but postponed the decision on new sanctions.
The US officials pointed out that the countries on which Obama wishes the main partners in the Islamic problem are not necessarily NATO members.
The accumulation of problems could not be anticipated two years ago when the previous NATO summit was held in Chicago, when the debate was dominated by the withdrawal of soldiers from Afghanistan.
A year earlier, Robert M. Gates, then leader, made his final speech to say that the organisation has almost reached the point of "joint military inactivity".
U.S. officials continued to complain that other countries were unable to achieve their funding objectives.
NATO members promise to spend 2% of their GDP on defence expenditure, but only four Member States – Estonia, Greece, Great Britain and the United States – achieved this objective last year.
Now, however, officials of the White House say that they have noticed a change.
NATO members are expected to sign an agreement in Cardiff that promises to increase their funding for defence cooperation.
The details were discussed late last week, but the White House found that this time the company has a genuine desire for the Member States to see potential threats in their actual size.
Following Russia's invading Ukraine's defence promises are more important and important than ever after the end of the Cold War, says Charles Kucha, President of the United States National Security Council.
We are quite hopeful that we will reach agreement between the 28 Member States.
Obama spends a large part of his journey to strengthen his commitment to the defence co-operation in the interests of Russia's concerned neighbours.
The President will begin his three-day trip with a lasting visit to Tallinn, Estonia, where he will meet the leaders of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
NATO has recycled its troops in Estonia since Russia joined the Crimean peninsula of Ukraine this year, and NATO troops will be recycled regularly in Estonia when a new preparedness plan, which will be published this week, will be put in place.
The plan aims to shorten the time that NATO needs to react to the attacks in the border states, the officials say.
The plan is to increase air surveillance and other visible defence signs.
The changes present a small risk for NATO, which refrained from establishing permanent bases in Eastern and Central Europe as evidence of friendship with Russia.
According to officials, the new plan is not a violation of the agreement, but it can also be a semantic difference, says a diplomat from the West who did not want to be named to the public in the course of the discussions before the formal information is made available.
NATO’s presence is likely to be described as long-term, not permanent, said the diplomat.
Does Putin use an effective "talviase" to use it in Ukraine?
Russian President Vladimir Putin has one ace in his sleeve for Ukraine.
The Western countries and Ukraine have repeatedly accused Putin of arming the rebels in eastern Ukraine and sending Russian troops to Ukrainian soil.
That is why the West has imposed sanctions on Russia.
Once the situation in Ukraine is tightened up, the Western countries are planning tougher sanctions against Russia.
Russia, however, has a power card: winter is coming, and Russia is the main energy source of Ukraine.
According to the American authorities, Ukraine's primary energy sources are natural gas (40%) and coal (28%) and Geysar Gurbanov, who is active at Harvard University, writes according to Business Insider.
When the winter comes to Ukraine within the next four months and the coal mines are located in the eastern part of the country’s conflict, the Ukrainians will freeze to their homes when the gas supply from Russia is stopped.
Therefore, if the rebels fail to achieve their goal, Gazprom, the Russian energy waste, will help Putin to win the war at the end, Gurbanov will write.
Last year half of the gas used in Ukraine came from Russia.
Russia cut off gas supplies to Ukraine on 16 July due to outstanding invoices.
Earlier this month, Mr Gazprom announced that the Ukrainian debt on gas had already been EUR 5.3 billion (approx. EUR 4 billion) by 1 August.
According to The New York Times, Putin commented on the coming winter as follows:
I think that no one is thinking about it (in winter) anymore, except Russia, Putin said.
There are always ways to make it easier.
Firstly, the immediate cessation of hostilities and the repair of the necessary infrastructure.
The necessary repairs must be made to complete the restocking and the cold season should be prepared.
According to Business Insider, Putin's comment can be interpreted as a masked threat.
If the Ukrainian army does not retreat from the Separatists, Moscow can use natural gas as a weapon.
Alistair Newman, a Japanese holding company in Nomura, pointed out last month that Russia's talks about humanitarian intervention and the planning of a possible new natural gas crisis in Ukraine will be strengthened in a few months if Russia can maintain separatist activities until then.
Moscow has already announced that Ukraine will have to pay in advance for future gas supplies unless the Kiev sector pays for accumulated debts.
The EU is trying to negotiate an agreement which would allow the continued import of gas on a temporary basis.
Last week Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseni Jatsenuk said that Russia is planning to stop gas supplies to EU countries in the winter.
Later, the Russian Minister of Energy, Alexander Novak, told us that the talks were endless.
He said that Russia would do everything in its power to deliver gas to the EU countries.
The liberal lavloggari received 10 years of imprisonment and a thousand stripes
The Saudi court has held the ten-year sentence issued to Raif Badaw, the founder of the liberal Free Saudi Liberals.
The judgment includes a further one thousand stripes and a million ril (about EUR 200 000) fines.
The judgment was based on the fact that he had set up an Islamic derogatory website.
On Monday, Suad al-Shamari, the second founder of the organisation, informed AFP of the judgment.
Badawi himself has been imprisoned since 2012.
Badawi was sentenced to seven years in prison in July 2013 and to 600 stripes, but the sentence was appealed and re-affirmed.
The judgment was also appealed in May, when Amnesty International also pointed out its injustice.
Madventures Riku Rantala's childhood experience in Afghanistan: "It was one revolutionary human encounter"
The Madventures today published a new book World Explanation - The Adventurer's explanation of everything.
We asked Riku Randala about the future of the world and the differences between Indian and Finnish culture.
The crime also tells us about the most important human encounter of your life.
Author, journalist, the other side of Madventures Riku Rantala is a busy man.
A new book has been published today, yesterday there was a filmmaker at the Citizens' Square and Wednesday the second production period for Ylela Docventures begins.
Ever since this morning, he's been running from place to place.
Maikkar's morning TV show to take the baby to and from the day care center to the weekly party.
An interview with the most face-to-face needs to be moved to a telephone interview.
If you don't, you won't have time.
In the middle of all the urgency he and the other half of Madventures, Tunna Millionoff has had time to stop and write the World Explanation Book, which according to the book coverbook, is an adventurer's manual for everything.
For everything?
Wow, that's a lot of promise.
The book deals with a number of themes, such as what is our future, why another culture does worse than the other one, why we are here and who we really are.
We used the interviews we've been doing over the years.
The book includes both professors and artists.
Actively we worked on the book for about a year, Riku tells the IS by phone.
You've written a pretty big piece in the book.
What is the main message of the book?
The need to know more about the world and the big questions should be considered, because then we will be doing the best in this world.
On the other hand, the book idis is to be a good travel reader, but it is also intended to get people to discuss and share ideas at home.
The debate can even lead to action, Riku says.

One of the themes of your book is the future of the world.
What does it look like?
We concluded that the human species is optimistic.
Despite global warming and the current state of the earth, it is imperative to believe that at some point we will be making decisions to improve our situation.
The earth is a kind of alcoholic.
First it should admit that we have a problem, only then can change, Riku philosophie.
According to Riku, according to some studies, Western mankind has reached the peak of happiness in the 1970s.
Since then, prosperity has not increased our happiness.
From this we can conclude that when enough money is available and our basic needs are met, we are happy.
Money doesn't add to happiness.
So we want to wake people up and talk about what's enough.
Taking advantage of our natural resources will not be enough for long, says Riku.
In your book, you also discussed the differences between cultures.
How does an Indian person differ from a Finnish person?
People don't know much about each other.
Of course, the starting points for education, health and hygiene are different.
The culturally large difference is that the Community's importance in India is much greater in terms of both good and bad.
When the western worlds have made more money, people live more alone.
Isolate others and may lead to loneliness and anxiety.
When we find a suitable balance between sociality and solitude, we'd be pretty close to happiness, Riku tells us.
Riku has faced a lot of different people in the world.
What human encounter has been best reflected in his mind?
It is located in my childhood, when I was with my family on my first trip abroad.
We lived in India and Pakistan for a year while my father was working for the United Nations.
I was seven years old and two of my younger sisters were involved.
My brother was just a baby, Riku's in charge.
Home to Finland was accompanied by a large moving car.
We went to war in Afghanistan when there were a huge number of refugees on the sides of the road.
On the road was a girl my age carrying her little brother in her arms.
I was sitting on a big merch seat with a coke can in my hand.
We got eyes on him, Riku's describing.
Yes, a child of your age understands the situation.
It was one revolutionary human encounter I'll always remember.

Riku and Tunna at the book fair in 2013.
At that time Riku "go to the cabbage" that other people must be respected, even if they were much poorer or they would not have the same conditions of life as ours.
Riku realized at that time that money could not be a measure of human dignity.
From the memories of adults to the surface, the people in New Guinea are coming up.
I couldn’t stop wondering how traditionally people lived there.
They use natural materials to benefit from everything, not using money or metal tools.
They live under very challenging living conditions.
It's really hard to survive.
It made me think.
And he wants to think about it with Tunna, too, to get the readers of his new book.
The idea is that our book inspires people to read, see and listen more.
To make people do things from warm love to conversation, or even to a fist fight, Riku throws.
It's the Kahahaoki magazine.
The events started when the couple arrived by bus to the station and ordered a taxi.
When the taxi left, the man in the yard threw a cab after an object.
The driver got out of the car, the same guy as the passenger.
The man who threw him on the scene stabbed the male passenger life-threateningly in the head and in the hand and left the scene.
The stabilizer is a 170-175 centimeters pole, a short-haired man.
According to the newspaper, there has been a young woman with a pale ponytail near the scene.
They're hoping he'll get in touch with the police.
The police are also asking for clues from any person who may have made observations on the events or persons involved in the case.
The stab wound occurred on Wednesday 27 August at 7:50 p.m.
"Hey!" said the brain to the brain, the world's first telepathic message passed through the Internet.
The scientific publication PLOS ONE has published an article stating that the international group of researchers has been the first to convey the message directly to the mind.
The first messages that were sent through the system were "hola" and "ciao", i.e. "hello" in Spanish and Italian.
The experiment was designed to monitor the electrical brain curve of the sender test person.
The sender was trained with the program to send bits either by thinking about the movement of the hand or leg.
The imagination of the leg movement was interpreted as zero, and moving hands into one.
This information, coded as bits, was sent online to the recipient.
The recipient was made aware by magnetic stimulation of each flash of light per encoded bit.
The recipient was taught to interpret flashes as a message.
Researchers admit that this is still a field of study in their children’s shoes, but believe that computer - assisted telepathic communication is a routine for mankind in the near future.
Penalties - Point - The Future of the countryside
The EU is preparing new sanctions against Russia.
The United States is also tightening up its own sanctions.
There is a political need for sanctions.
It would be impossible for the EU and the United States not to react when Russia is at war in Ukraine and occupied Crimea.
In international politics, the act follows a reaction, action countermeasures.
Experience shows that all sanctions will only be bitten in the long term.
Iran was allowed to tend to negotiate its nuclear programme only after years.
For decades, the South African Racial Order sat in place, although trade was banned by UN decisions.
sanctions have also been used against Russia.
During the Cold War, no high-end electronics or military technology was allowed to be exported to the Soviet Union.
Russia itself has placed barriers to trade on the world's side.
Last time I checked, the raw timber trade was frozen.
It is clear that forcing Russia will not get to its knees.
The Russians are used to bad times, and the disappearance of Viola from the store does not cause panic.
When the EU intends to ban the import of vodka from Russia, it is mainly a joke.
The Russians would love to drink that vodka themselves.
EU sanctions are also selective.
The French are allowed to export air carriers to Russia, but Finland cannot export milk.
The gas flow from Russia to Germany continues.
The biggest disadvantage for Russia is not the theft of imports of cheese or exports of vodka.
The financial sector is most vulnerable to restrictions.
They will only affect the future.
The Russian State cannot operate on the international loan market.
It's gotta shorten old loans, but it's hard to take a new one.
Even though Russia has enormous currency reserves, they can't last forever.
Russian companies' access to credit is fading and money is tilting.
My own banks are not able to finance everyone.
More money is needed or companies are facing payment difficulties.
Bankruptcy is also bankruptcy in Russia, Russia is a capitalist country.
If the crisis continues for years, Russian modernisation will stop, as Russian expert René Nyberg wrote in Helsingin Sanoma.
It wouldn't be the first time.
In time, Russia would once again return to Russia and move in.
An exceptional free-press event was held in North Korea
Some 10,000 North Koreans and a number of diplomats followed the international free-press matches held in Pyongyang on Saturday.
Antonio Inoki, a Japanese lawyer who moved from lawyer to freelance, took part in the event from Japan, the United States, China, France, Brazil and Mexico.
In addition to the free-press matches, taekwondo matches were also seen by local athletes.
According to Inok, the aim of the event was to bring the countries in dispute closer through sport and promote world peace.
In their speeches, politicians hoped for an improvement between North Korea and Japan.
In the summer, Japan removed the sanctions imposed on North Korea by the Japanese kidnappings in the 1970s and 1980s.
On the other hand, North Korea promised to reopen the investigation into these cases.
The last time we saw international free pressure in North Korea was 1995.
SOK reduces around 110 persons from the consumer goods trade organization.
The YT negotiations began in June, when the reduction needed was estimated to be up to 130.
According to the company, its organisation has now been decommissioned and its responsibilities have been clarified.
SOK states that it is seeking a clearly better cost-effectiveness and synergies between different sectors of activity.
In addition to the economic downturn and the decline in consumer demand, the structural change in trade has shaken trade in goods in particular.
The result of the S-Group's commodity trade has been a loss for some time now.
The YT negotiations concerned all employees and management of SOK's operating and daily asset trade, i.e. about 530 persons in total.
Turku Sanomat: Some of the self-medication medicines behind the counter
According to the newspaper, there are more medicines to be taken between prescription medicines and medicines to be taken from the shelf without a prescription, but only after the advice of the pharmacist’s employee.
According to the Finnish Pharmacopoeia Association, eye drops containing antibiotics, for example, could come under advice.
After an interview with a pharmacist or pharmacist and having met the pre-defined criteria, the medicinal product could be administered from behind the counter, the president of the Federation of Medicinal Products, Kirsi Kvarnström Turku Sanoma, will consider.
Finland already has to obtain a few medicines without a prescription, but it is a medicine that requires advice.
One of these is an ex-post contraceptive.
Corruption for more specific reasons
Finland will pay more attention to the fight against corruption.
It has been recommended by both the OECD and the Council of Europe, as the world is puzzled by the small number of bribes and convictions in Finland.
By the end of the year, the Working Party of the Ministry of Justice will consider whether the Code of Conduct on trade and abuse of influence would be necessary.
The differences in the legislation emerged, for example, in the trial of the Slovene branch of Patria's bribe in Hämeenlinna a year ago.
The trade of influence in Slovenia brought a two-year prison sentence to the former Prime Minister, but the Finnish law does not know the corresponding criminal code.

Wanderers coach Tony Popovic believes he's getting a tour of Asia Champions League fighting for Korea
Tony Popovic lacks three key players in Korea.
Many Western Sydney Wanderers players are banned in the first game, and Coach Tony Popovic does not hesitate to throw other players into the Asia Championships League Witch Catalyst FC Seoul.
The Wanderers are at a 10-day training camp in Dubai, which also includes two friendships games in Abu Dhab, so that the team can prepare for the first semifinal match to be held on 17 September.
Because of excessive yellow cards, Tomi Juric, Brendan Santalab and Shannon Cole miss Korea, but Coach Popovic believes in their guests.
"Of course this is a loss – they have been three very important players in ACL for us," Popovic says.
Tomi Juric in China was banned from this gesture.
It's a setback, none of the players should be gone, but we didn't have Mattya (Spiranovic) in the first game, and until now Daniel Mullen has been hurt.
Whoever comes in, I'm sure he's done a lot of work, and I totally trust the whole team.
I'm not afraid to play against anyone just in the semifinals.
The Wanderers will also have to be without Spiranovic, which will continue to recover from ankle surgery.
The defenseman of the Socceroos team was injured before the beginning of the season, but has continued to run, and it is possible that he will play in the return match at Pirtek Stadium on October 1.
"He's back on track and he's going to be fine," Popovic says.
He follows his own training program and goes with us to Dubai, which is great news for him, because it means gradually returning to the field.
He's been practicing out there a couple of times, which is good.
It'll be a while before she's completely okay, but she'll be fine.
In Dubai, the Wanderers team has facilities that represent the world’s top in the Al Sheba Sports Complex.
Popovic also considers that the trip to Dubai is a good opportunity for the team to get to know each other better after the major changes at the end of the last season.
"We know this will help players to create ties for sure," Popovic says.
We have a lot of new players, and this is an excellent opportunity for them to get to know each other even better both on and off the field.
So we use the camp for many purposes.
Elite burger pays three times the employee's monthly salary
01.09.2014 21:18 North Korea can enjoy the luxury of rich economies if it happens to belong to the elite of the country.
The Financial Times tells us about the economy that was torn up by the opposites.
In North Korea, the informal markets may flourish more than ever.
They offer a luxury to wealthy or wealthy ordinary citizens, which is not used to joining a dictatorship.
The Financial Times have visited Munsu Water Park: the entertainment center, where a mere ticket costs up to ten months' ordinary worker's salary.
It's a place where you get burgers that pay $76.
It's a three-to-five-month pay for the country's usual duel.
In the pool, men drink beer in their shorts.
Life looks expensive and nice.
North Korea's "Western market" started in the 1990s when the country suffered from famine.
The government allows them to exist, even though the prices of supplies can be gross.
However, many people in the capital of Pyongyang have a mobile phone with an Ox of $200.
Part of the reason may be the ruler of Kim Jong-un, 31 who has tried to create a self-enhancing and youthful picture.
In his time, the administration has stressed the importance of technology in the earth's flourishing process.

Ormiston House: Stormont Council Wishful for Sales
The Stormont Council is hopeful that it has found the buyer at Ormiston House, a building located in Belfast, which paid taxpayers nearly £3,000 a week.
The Council bought a building from the 19th century in the eastern part of the city 13 years ago and paid £9 million for it.
The Council failed to continue selling the building, when the security and maintenance of the building came to the Council to pay about £400 a day.
The building was sold at £1.25 million.
Apparently, the building will be used as a private residential building.
The Council bought a building of historic value for category B by £9 million in 2001, because it needed more office space.
However, it was subsequently found that the building was not suitable for this purpose.
Ten years after the purchase of the building, it was put back on sale at £2.5 million this time.
The building couldn't be sold, and the price was calculated.
Last year, Mike Nesbitt, an Ulster Unionist party, suggested that Ormiston House perhaps fit into the premises of a new international trauma center.
However, the Council has now confirmed that it is negotiating the sale of the building.
According to the representative, the building will be transferred to the new owner as soon as the paperwork is completed.
Both the Council and the real estate agent remain silent about the identity of the buyer and the sales price.
The weekly security and repair costs of Ormiston House are about £3,000.
The Council purchased a building from the police force that preceded Northern Ireland Police Board.
By the beginning of this year, the security costs of Ormiston House amounted to GBP 885 641 and maintenance costs to GBP 371 379.
The price of professional services related to repair and maintenance was GBP 250 015 and the remuneration of development and design professionals was GBP 212 466.
In the past, the building was owned by the shipbuilder Sir Edward Harland, who lived in the building until 1887, when it was purchased by Harland's business partner William Pirrie.
Soon after the death of Lord Pirrie, 1924 Harland & Wolff became the owner of the building, and in 1928, the company sold it to Campbell College, which held it until the mid-70s.
"Emergency increases": Helsinki plans to reduce the number of school assistants
There's no savings, JHL claims.
Helsinki is preparing a radical reduction in the number of school-specific helpers.
The reduction would not apply to the child’s personal assistant.
In the spring, the Helsinki Board of Education decided to present a total of approximately 2.7 million cutbacks from the resources of the school assistants.
Helsinki has a total of about 600 school assistants.
If the cuts occur, they will enter into force in the middle of the semester immediately from the beginning of the year.
According to the trade union JHL, the decision increases inequalities.
More and more children need support in learning.
Unfortunately, however, it is easy for assistants to reduce their savings because the amount of aid for learning is not clearly defined by law.
There is no guarantee that savings will be made; on the contrary, the labour burden of the teaching staff will increase.
For school students, savings pose a greater risk of falling from the learning goals and the ability of teachers is tough, stressing the CEO of JHL Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The plans of the City of Helsinki vary from school to school, as small schools and pupils in need of support will no longer receive any resources at all.
The goal of the City of Helsinki is to prevent exclusion.
Efficient preventive work is being carried out by school assistants.
However, the adaptation measures of the Agency are mainly directed towards this group.
All parties will suffer from this in the future.
In the autumn, the City Council of Helsinki will make the final solution to its resources, for which I hope to look far ahead and to act in accordance with its objectives, says Niemi-Laine.
Israel Powers the Earth on the West Bank
The Israelite women walk in a Jewish settlement called Gevaot in the area of Etzion near Bethlehem.
On Sunday, Israel conquered nearly 400 hectares of land on the West Bank in a Jewish settlement near Bethlehem. This may be a sign of Israel’s significant future construction in the region, and at the same time defies the Palestinians’ request not to build more settlements and to challenge the general opinion of the world community.
The Israeli 'Peace Now' group, which is opposed to the expansion of the authorities on the West Bank, believed that the events on Sunday could be the largest single country takeover in the West Bank region for decades and could "dramatically change the situation in the region".
The goal of the Palestinians is to establish their own state for the countries which Israel conquered in 1967.
According to the Israeli authorities, the political impetus for assessing the situation in the countryside came after three Israeli young people were kidnapped and killed in June after they were lifted in the area.
In July, the Israeli authorities arrested a Palestinian accused of kidnapping and killing.
The timing of taking over the land suggests that it was meant to be a kind of compensation for the population and punishment of the Palestinian people of the settlement.
The land situated near the Jewish Gevaot facility in the Etzio district of South Jerusalem has now been officially declared a "state land" when it used to be privately owned by Palestinians, a necessary step so that Israel can start to design buildings if it so wishes.
However, the mayor of Surif, a nearby Palestinian city, Ahmad Lafi, said that the country belongs to Palestinian families.
He told the Palestinians' official news agency WAFA that the Israeli army and its staff published early on Sundays the regulations in which Israel announced that it would take over the land containing olives and other trees of Surif and nearby villages Al-Jaba and Wadi Fukin.
Any objections should be raised within 45 days.
The kidnapping of young people caused Israel’s army to discipline the Islamic group that controls Gaza on the West Bank against Hamas, which Israel says was behind the kidnappings.
The tensions that followed at the border between Israel and Gaza covered the 50 - day war that ended last week in the ceasefire of Egypt.
The takeover of the land has quickly drawn attention to the Israeli-controlled West Bank and revealed the conflicting objectives of the Israeli government, which make it difficult for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process to develop more widely.
The crisis in Lapland is usually complex.
A growing proportion of the municipalities of Lapland are in problems, and the well-being study prepared by the University of Lapland and Lapland University of Applied Sciences shows.
There are no quick solutions to crisis problems.
According to the professor, reducing municipal tasks by EUR 1 billion is not enough.
The common features of the crisis include weak municipal economy, poor employment and migration losses.
According to Professor Asko Suikkanen, emeritus Professor of Sociology at the University of Lapland, new crisis zones are coming from the western border and from the Eastern Child.
In the survey survey, the residents assessed the situation in their municipalities quite realisticly.
The residents of the municipalities who were well performing in the study were even pessimistic.
Strong expectations affect consumption.
People hope that today’s everyday life and well - being will be preserved, perhaps even slightly improved.
In this time, it is not afraid to think about longer-term investments, such as buying a dwelling, says Suikkanen.
The team was surprised by the big differences between municipalities.
For example, per capita income support expenditure varies from two to tens to over 100 euros.
The tax revenues of the municipality per capita range from EUR 2 000 to EUR 4400 from Ranua.
According to the suikkanen, the municipalities of Lapland are different.
How money is spent, how much state participation is made, and what is the degree of debt is different from that of municipalities in similar situations, he says.

Britain may close borders with Islamic artists returning to the country
Britain may temporarily prevent the return of Islamic fighters to Iraq and Syria.
This is the case with the BBC, referring to the sources of government.
However, according to the BBC, British citizens who have been suspected of terrorism would be allowed to hold their citizenship.
According to the government source, this is one of the many proposals that will be considered.
The proposal is currently being finalised, and Prime Minister David Cameron is due to present it.
The government is also looking for ways to make it difficult for potential fighters to travel abroad.
One way may be to increase the powers of the authorities so that they can temporarily confiscate the passports of potential fighters at the border.
On Friday, Britain raised the possibility of terrorism to the second highest level.
Bob Carr is happy about the immediate release of the Australian attorney, Melinda Taylor, from the Libyan prison.
An Australian lawyer, Melinda Taylor, is expected to be released from the Libyan prison today.
The Federal Government was pleased with the news that the Libyan authorities are expected to release Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor today.
The Foreign Minister, Bob Carr, said that "all is going well" and the ICC's lawyer will be released from custody of the Australian authorities this evening, after which he will board a plane to Europe by midnight.
"We are pleased with the news that he is likely to be released today," he commented to the AAP News Office in New York.
We thank the Libyan authorities for their cooperation.
Australia also thanked the wider international community for its assistance and support, said the representative.
Taylor is likely to fly to Rome before the journey to his home in The Hague.
Taylor and three of his criminal court lawyers were arrested in Zintan, Liberia, on 7 June, in their representation in Seif al-Islam, son of former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddaf.
According to the Libyan authorities, Taylor took the papers to Seif, which they believe threatened national security.
Senator Carr has gone through a lot of effort to free Taylor, and he traveled to the capital of Libya last month to try to do this thing.
Taylor couldn't have talked to her husband or little daughter until last week.
Senator Carr said Taylor was allowed to make a short call to his home in The Hague shortly after the visit of Australian Ambassador David Ritchie.
Carr also spoke to Taylor’s parents in Brisbane, John and Janelle, who were relieved to hear that Taylor was finally allowed to use the phone.
Taylor’s parents had appealed to Libya to release his daughter before the third birthday of this little child in July.
Three other lawyers in the criminal court are from Lebanon, Russia and Spain.
Carr said a week ago that following a debate between a lawyer released in The Hague and the Libyan authorities, "the criminal lawyer was sorry and apologized for any misunderstanding.
The International Criminal Court has not spoken of mistakes, but has promised to thoroughly examine the actions of its team once its members return to their home.
"After the outcome of its investigation by the International Criminal Court, it will ensure that all those who have been wrong will be properly condemned", the Court announced in its communication last month.
The International Criminal Court is suing 39-year-old Seif Al-Islam for crimes against humanity during his father's reign, which ended unexpectedly last year.
According to Tripoli, his trial should be local and he took an initiative on 1 May in which he announced that he would not accept the decision of the criminal court lawyer to hold a trial in The Hague.
A young newcomer saved Barcelona - ESS.fi
Barcelona took its second victory at the early stages of the Spanish football league, but easily Villarreal did not fall home.
The blues stabbed their heads in the head of the Villarreal Guard Sergio Assenjo until the 82nd minute finally succeeded.
The winning goal was made by a surprising man: a 19-year-old, who first appeared in La Liga, an assailant Sandro Ramirez had only come into the field 12 minutes earlier.
The young man invited to the mission crew from Barcelona team two finished close after Asenjo had rejected Lionel Messi’s company.
Collections to the Ferguson police ended mysteriously after a $433,000 crossing.
Maintainers closed two online collection sites without explanation this weekend for sites collected for more than $400 000 for the police who shot an unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, Missouri.
Two separate pages of the public’s “Support Officer Darren Wilson” and “Support Officer Wilson” have collected 235 750 dollars and 197 620 dollars for the Ferguson police that shot Michael Brown.
A similar site maintained by Brown's family attorney had collected $314 099 after Sunday afternoon.
The shooting was followed by a series of weeks of unrest and demonstrations, mostly against the almost white police forces of Ferguson, mostly inhabited by the blacks, which forced Wilson to hide while local and federal investigations were trying to determine if he shot Brown for no reason.
The network's collection campaigns have produced some criticisms about the defence of Wilson, especially since some visitors had written racist comments to the comment, which have since been removed.
Both sides apparently stopped receiving donations almost at the same time on Saturday, and the administrators of the pages did not give any reason for this.
When trying to give a donation to a visitor, he sees a message that says, "Donations will no longer be received!
The organizer has stopped collecting donations.
On Sunday, a representative of the GoFundMe site gave a statement to the Los Angeles Times that the site has not prevented donations from being given.
" Each organiser of the GoFundMe campaign will decide when to stop receiving donations," said Kelsea Little, a representative of the GoFundMe website.
The organisers may also, if they wish, continue receiving donations later.
The "Support Officer Wilson" page, with a return of $197,620, is maintained by a charity group made up of officers from St. Louis, a recipient of donations approved by GoFundMe.
On Sunday, three police officers designated as official representatives of the State of Shield of Hope did not immediately respond to e-mails asking for more information on the collection campaign.
Zoll is an official informant at the Ferguson Police Department,Eagan is a member of the nearby Florissant City Council and a member of Roorda Missouri's House of Representatives.
Also, the Times did not immediately contact the anonymous founder of the "Support Officer Darren Wilson" page, who uses the name "Stand Up" and has collected $235 750.
However, a representative of the GoFundMe site assured The Times in a statement that an anonymous benefactor existed.
The anonymous benefactor of the collection campaign has been given little information to donors, unlike the administrators of another Wilson page or Brown site.
An anonymous Wilson page benefactor wrote a message to visitors two weeks ago that the site cooperates with the Shield of Hope group to become officially approved recipients of donations.
The approval has not yet been granted.
The benefactor provided additional information to wanted visitors with an e-mail address with an alias, but did not respond immediately on Sunday to the request for more information.
In a statement to The Times, a representative of the GoFundMe page said that the anonymous collection page has been deleted from the search results of the main website and added that "this campaign no longer meets the requirements of the GoFundMe site that require an effective Facebook account".
The information security practices of the GoFundMe website call on users to "donate only to the users of GoFundMe who they know and trust in".
Unfortunately, there is no valid guarantee that the content of the website of GoFundMe is accurate and honest.
However, according to representative Little, GoFundMe has been "in contact with the campaign organiser, and there is no reason to doubt his honesty.
GoFundMe will also be able to arrest all the funds collected if there is a need to start research in connection with a campaign.
However, GoFundMe did not consider it appropriate to arrest the funds collected by the campaign in question.
The popular Facebook page "Support Officer Wilson", which has organised campaigns supporting Wilson, told the followers of the page this weekend that lawyers are trying to find a "clarification" of why the donors of the GoFundMe site have been prevented from donate, but the page did not provide any further information.
There is also an anonymous administrator on the Facebook page, and these comments could not be confirmed by an independent source.
Arsenal's top winner at the end of the year - Valioliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
The French winner of the English Valioligi Arsenal, Olivier Giroud, is likely to be on the side until the turn of the year.
Giroud's ankle was cut on Wednesday and recovery takes months.
Giroud hurt his leg at the Valioliiga game against Everton this weekend.

Jens Lapidus and Silta series handwriters to make a series of crimes together
Jens Lapidus, one of the best-known crime writers in Sweden, and Hans Rosenfeldt, who made the popular Silta series, prepares a new TV series together.
The 10-part Advokaten series's descriptions are scheduled to begin next year.
The Swedish production company Tre Vänner reported on the project on Monday in the press release.
The series has been purchased by Swedish TV4.
The third author of the series is Michael Hjort.
A young lawyer named Frank, located in Stockholm, is told by a lawyer who, in one case, finds dark connections between his own family and the notorious criminal groups.
The criminal writer Lapidus, who has been promoted with money, is a defence lawyer from his civil profession.
