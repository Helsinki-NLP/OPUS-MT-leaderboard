The members of the Welsh National Assembly are afraid to find themselves at the Muppet Show
Some members of the National Assembly were shocked by the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Wales Parliament).
The alarm came to light after the National Assembly (Assembly) was called the Welsh Parliament.
Now, the various political representatives are all afraid that the new title can make them laugh.
According to one of the Labour MEPs, his group is concerned that their new name will cry out for the words Twp and Pwp.
Not for our Welsh readers: twp is one-sided in the Welsh language, and pwp is a poop.
According to one of the representatives of the Plaid Party, the whole group is "unsatisfied" and alternatives are therefore proposed.
One conservative MP said that his group was "open" to change names, however he noted that MWP was just another jump from "Muppet".
Here it is worth noting that the word “w” in the Welsh language is written in the same way as the word “u” in Yorkshire English, i.e. “map” in MWP.
The position of the National Assembly Committee responsible for drawing up the draft law which introduced the name change is as follows: "The final decision is naturally in the hands of the Members as regards the titles for the appointment of the members of the National Assembly."
The Law of 2017 governing the government of Wales allowed the name of the Welsh National Assembly to change.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation which proposed the name of the Welsh Parliament and which received broad support.
As regards the title of Members, the Commission prefers the title of the Welsh Parliament Member (representative of the Welsh Parliament) and the abbreviation of the WMP, but the public consultation rather supported the alternative MWP.
Members are coming up with new and new alternatives, but the agreement is rather difficult, which is a problem for the President of the National Assembly, Elin Jones, who has to submit a legislative proposal on name changes in the coming weeks.
The reform law will also affect the functioning of the National Assembly on other points, including the disqualification of Members and the Commission structures.
Members will be able to put their final vote on the question of their own title during the debate on the draft law.
Macedonia holds a referendum on changing the name of the country
Citizens will vote on a Sunday to change the country's name to the "Night Macedonian Republic".
The aim of the referendum is to point to the end of a decades-long debate with neighbouring Greece, one of which is also called Macedonia.
Athens has long stated that it is essentially a territorial demand with the name of its northern neighbour and has repeatedly objected to its request for admission to the EU and NATO.
President Gjorge Ivanov personally opposes the referendum on name-change and thus does not take part in it.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the name change is simply a compromise that they need to make for their EU-Nature accession.
The Harlem churches are in a difficult situation, and the bells of St. Martin remain silent.
“Better, as I hear from the elders, there was a bar and a church on every corner,” says Adams.
"Today, none of them are anymore."
As you say, the disappearance of bars would be understandable.
“ People are already dating differently, ” he says.
– Bars are no longer the community days where people end up daily."
As far as churches are concerned, Adams fears that the sale of church property will not replace the hopes of the leaders, “and in time they will be held again where they came from.”
And instead of replacing the churches, he adds, housing buildings that are not helping the fate of the remaining churches will also be avoided.
“The vast majority of people who buy housing in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and this hastens the final closure of the churches, since it is unlikely that the majority of those who move into these homes would join the religious community.”
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became the black city – the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, the St. Martint a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out of church in the thirties,
then possessed by a nearby black congregation.
The church of St. Martin was taken over by the black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson – the Reverend is known to lead a boycott against the blacks and the blacks and blacks.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, but during the renovation the bell game was built to order the Johnson community.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son, and his successor at St. Martin's parish, proudly referred to the play as "the bells of the poor".
In July, according to the music expert, this game is "a cultural heritage", "an irreplaceable instrument of historical significance".
The University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also noted that this was the first game in the world that was played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, was involved in the larger game of the Riverside Church.
Merriweather said that St. Martin didn't sign anyone.
In St. Martin's last few months, a difficult situation has erupted with the participation of builders and entrepreneurs, partly involved in the secular leadership of the church, partly the bishop's office.
The governing body of the Parliament, the Council of the Church in July, addressed to the Bishop's Office in writing, in objections to the fact that the Office would "transmit the costs" to the Council, although the Council did not participate in the selection of the architects and contractors contracted by the Office.
Some members of the religious community complain about the lack of transparency in the Office’s premises.
Shark attacked a 13-year-old boy in California while fishing for crab.
According to official reports, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy fishing for crab on the day of the crab season, Saturday in California.
The attack took place before 7 a.m. on the Beacon's Beach Coast at Encinitas.
Chad Hammel, on the KSWB TV channel in San Diego, told me that he and his friends were diving about half an hour ago on Saturday morning when he was paying attention to a boy crying for help, and then he spent more of his time helping him get out of the water.
Hammel first thought the boy was just excited because he managed to catch a cancer, but then he realized that he was yelling, “He bit me!
He bit me!"
“ At the keybone, his shoulder was torn apart, ” Hammel said, “what he saw when he arrived at the boy’s house.
“The shark is in the water” he added.
The boy was brought to San Diego Children's Hospital with an airman, where he is currently being treated in critical condition.
The shark attacking the boy is unknown.
As Commander Larry Giles told the press, a few weeks earlier a shark was detected in the area, but then it was found that it was not a species dangerous to humans.
Captain Giles also told me that the boy suffered trauma on his upper body.
The authorities closed the coastline between Ponto Beach (Casablad) and Swami (Ecinitas) for 48 hours for safety reasons during the investigation.
According to Giles, more than 135 shark species occur in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's is expanding to the British beauty market
Sainsbury's expert would like to compete with the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains with salesmen and market-style pipers.
As part of the ongoing decline in sales of fashion and household goods on the British beauty market worth £2.8 billion, the chain is conducting the testing of large-scale pipe stadiums across the country and, if successful, they will also appear in new stores from next year.
The strengthening of the piper line is due to trying to fill the shelf areas previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and household articles in different ways.
Sainsbury's said that it doubles its offer to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which are the first to offer.
But previous brands, L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be located in a larger area on stands of brands such as Boots and similar stores.
The store chain is also relaunching Boutique's make-up family, in which most products are now vegan – these are now being sought by more and more young customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop perfumer tests the appearance of two Sainsbury's stores, one of which was opened last week in Croydon, south of London, while the other opens this year in Birmingham's Selly Oak.
With the spread of online shopping and the shifting of food shopping practices towards small local shops, the big stores need to make greater efforts to attract customers.
According to the CEO of Sainsbury's, Mike Coupe, the supply will be more and more similar to the retail trade, as the chain of stores tries to compete with discounts such as Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and other products than food.
Since he bought the two chains two years ago, in hundreds of stores in Sainsbury's he opened Argos classes as well as some of the Habitat classes – this step has also had a positive impact on food sales, making the acquisition even more profitable.
The chain of stores has failed its previous attempt to sew up beauty care and pharmaceutical classes.
Sainsbury's had a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the debate on the distribution of the revenues of pharmaceuticals classes in its stores brought this to an end.
The new strategy was born after Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmaceutical business to Celesio, operating the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain three years ago for £ 125 million.
According to the store chain, Lloyds will play a role in the strategy and will offer a wider range of luxury skin care products in four stores, with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the trading director of Sainsbury's, said: “By changing the appearance of our peppers, we want to create a more pleasant environment for our customers.
In addition, we have hired qualified staff to assist interested people with advice.
Our brand offer serves all the needs and the attractive environment and the comfortably accessible location provides a form of seductive force that brings your shopping experience to a new level."
Peter Jones "murdered" after Holly Willoughby resigned from the 11 million-dollar deal.
The Dragons’ Star, Peter Jones, was “dumped” after Holly Willoughby’s television broadcaster withdrew from the 11 million important agreements on the marketing business of lifestyle products to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly's home dress and accessories brand.
The company of the two celebrities was compared to the brand Goop, quoted earlier by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning's 37-year-old host on Instagram announced that he's out.
Holly Willoughby carefully pulled out the match at the Dragons’ Den star, Peter Jones, when he got out of their promising business of marketing lifestyle products at the last minute – to focus on his own highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to some sources, Jones was “destroyed” when on Tuesday, at the seat of Jones's business empire in Marlow (Buckinghamshire), he announced during a tense meeting that, due to his new contracts worth a total of £1.5 million, there was no time left for their common brand of home clothing and accessories to be devoted to Truly.
The company of the two celebrities was previously compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and is expected to double Willoughby's estimated assets to £11 million.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones traveled from island country to one of his cottages.
According to one source: “Truly was the most important thing for Holly.
It was to be dealt with in the long run, and this will give you a chance to live in the next few decades.
Getting out was a complete surprise for everyone.
I was surprised by what happened on Tuesday, because I was so close to leaving.
The warehouse in Marlow is full of goods waiting for sale."
According to the experts, the departure of one of the most profitable stars in this Morning, one of the UK, could cost the company millions of dollars due to the choice of corpses and possible slips from pillows and candles to clothing and household clothing.
And it could also mean the end of an old friendship.
For ten years, the three-year-old hostess and husband Dan Baldwin had a close friendship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones took over the presidency in March.
The two couples are used to vacation together, and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production office.
Willoughby will be the product face of M&S and take over Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV I'm Celebrity's programme.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We don’t want to comment on [Jones]’s business issues.”
Hard words were spoken, "and then we fell in love."
He was joking about what criticism he was going to receive from the press for his statement, which some people might consider to be "unsolicited", and for making such a positive statement about the North Korean leader.
“Why did Trump allow so much?
– said Trump in a funny "Irrigation" sound.
- I didn't allow anything."
As noted, Kim would like to meet for the second time after the first trial in Singapore in June, Trump welcomed North Korea as a huge step towards nuclear disarmament.
However, negotiations on nuclear weapons have been neglected.
Over three months after the June Singapore Summit, Ri Jongho, representing North Korea, said to the UN General Assembly on Saturday that, as his country sees, the United States will not have a "good response" on North Korea's early armaments.
Instead, it is said that the United States will continue to maintain sanctions for the use of pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic than that in a campaign speech.
“ things are going very well with North Korea, ” he said.
– We were going to war with them.
Millions of people would have been lost there.
But now we have a very good relationship."
As he said, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have shown positive results – the completion of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of American soldiers.
He also explained why he spoke so unusually about his relationship with Kim.
"It's not hard to act chiefly, but now there's not a ten thousand people out there trying to get in, just like two hundred ahead of me," Trump said, pointing to the group ahead.
In Indonesia, hundreds of dead people have died from the tsunamis and earthquakes on the island.
Following an earthquake in Lombardy, Indonesia has also refused the assistance of international aid organisations.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population had to be deployed, no disaster at national level has been reported, which would be a prerequisite for the arrival of international assistance.
"In many cases, they have stated very clearly that there is no need for international assistance, so our situation is a little difficult," Sumbung said.
The Save the Children Foundation is already working on the creation of a Palogo Eligible Aid Team, but it is not yet certain that foreigners will be able to participate in the rescues on the ground.
Sutopo, spokesperson of the National Disaster Management Agency, said that the Indonesian agencies are still carrying out an assessment of the situation in the request to see if international aid organisations need to be involved.
Despite the continuing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is extremely unprepared to face the destructive power of nature.
Although they were built in the province of Aceh, in other coastal areas this is not common at all.
There was also a tsunami signal in force, the apparent lack of a tsunami-signalling siren system in Palu has also contributed to the disaster requiring human life.
Transport in the Indonesian islands can be difficult even in the best time.
In times of natural disasters, logistics is even more problematic.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombek is on its way to Palu, but at least three more days before it reaches the affected zone.
President Widodo placed the development of the bald infrastructure of Indonesia at the centre of his election campaign and did not save the costs of road and rail projects.
However, the Joko Government is now facing budgetary deficits before next year's elections.
In addition, the President has to face the ongoing tensions of partyism in Indonesia, as members of the Muslim majority began to follow a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced because of the riots during which Christian and Muslim gangs fell among themselves on the streets with sorcerers, bows, and arrows, as well as other vehement weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge, in Liverpool, is a huge equator against Chelsea
At the Premier League game in Stamford Bridge, London, Daniel Sturridge, with his 89-minute shot, saved Liverpool, who did not lose against Chelsea.
The team lost 0-1 when Sturridge received a 30-metre injection from Xherdan Shaqir at Chelsea Gate.
He put the ball to the left first, and then he started a huge kick in the remote corner of the gate.
The shot was high above the 16th and headed towards the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball reached the net above the seeding Kepa Arrizabalaga.
“I just wanted to get in position, because there is always someone like Shaq, who plays the ball, so I tried to put myself in a better position,” said Sturridge, answering LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, and I just took her off, and then I didn't think much, and I shot her."
Chelsea led to 1–0 in the mid-term, after receiving the lead with the Belgian star player Eden Hazard at the 25th minute.
With the blues in the corner, Mateo Kovačič passed the ball, then managed to break off the middle field and run into Liverpool's square.
Kovačič started after a quick injection and got the ball back on the midfield.
Then, by a beautiful handout, he launched Hazard to the 16th.
Hazard ran the defense, and he finally sent the ball with a left shot at the far corner of Liverpool by Alison Becker.
Liverpool will meet Naples at 3 a.m. on Wednesday afternoon, at the next stop of the League of Champions team matches at the Stadium of San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea is playing against Videoton at 3 p.m. in London at the UEFA Europe League on Thursday.
832 victims of Indonesian tsunami
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, reported by the local disaster protection agency on Sunday.
Due to the 7.5-force earthquake on Friday and the six-metre-high floods that followed, several people were buried under the ruins, reported at a press conference by the agency spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The streets of Palu, with more than 380 thousand souls, are covered by the ruins of the collapsed buildings.
Police suspected of murder arresting a 32-year-old man in the case of a stabbed woman.
The police have initiated a murder investigation after a woman was found dead in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman's body was found in Grayson Mews at 7:55 a.m., and a 32-year-old man was already in custody for murder.
The police are asking the people in the area to report to anyone who has seen or died.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is still at an early stage, however, I would ask everyone who was in Birkenhead near John Street and perhaps saw or heard something to contact us.
In addition, I would ask all of us, especially cab drivers, that anyone who may have recorded anything with an on-board camera should also look for us, because they may have information relevant to the investigation."
The police spokesperson confirmed that the murdered woman was a sheephead resident and found inside a property.
During the afternoon, her friends arrived at the scene to find out where the body was found in the morning hours.
The investigation is under way, and the police are currently reporting to the victim's family.
A cab driver in Grayson Mews tried to get into his apartment, but the police informed him that no one was allowed to enter and leave the building for the time being.
When he found out what happened, he couldn't even speak.
The residents of the building have now been informed that it may take more hours to get back into the building.
One of the cops told someone that the entire building was currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman was struggling with her tears.
"This is terrible," he repeated.
At 2:00 p.m., two police microbuses were inside the chorus and another outside.
Within the chorus, several police officers were watching the block.
Anyone who has any information, please send a message to @MerPolCC, call the 101 number or contact the Crimestoppers organization without a name on the 0800 555 111 phone number and refer to the 247 file of 30 September.
The Parliamentary statue Cromwell is the latest victim of history rewriting fever
The exile of the statue could perhaps be poetic justice for the destruction of the cultural and religious heritage of England by Cromwell and his fanatical puritans at that time with Taliban enthusiasm.
According to the Cromwell Society, however, Crick's proposal is "crazy", an attempt to rewrite history.
According to the president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith: “It was essential for the Oliver Cromwell statue before the Westminster Palace to become a target in the current debates on the removal of statues.
During the English Civil War, Cromwell did not order and execute the image destruction.
So maybe another Cromwell fell victim to his prehistoric act, Thomas, in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's impressive Cromwell attraction reflects the opinion of the 19th century, and makes it a monument to a historical figure that has to be celebrated by many today."
In this regard, Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell may now be less than at the end of the 19th century, but many consider Parliament to be the protector of external pressure, which was naturally the Monarchy in his case.
The fact that this picture is indeed accurate remains the subject of a historical debate.
However, there is no doubt that this conflict that broke out in the middle of the 17th century has affected the further fate of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable person who represents one of the sides of this conflict.
And it is worth celebrating and remembering his achievements as a Lord protector."
Murderer pigs wounded to death by a Chinese master
Local press reports that a pig attacked and wounded a farmer in a market in the southwest of China.
Covered only by a man identified as Yuan, his last name was found with a blood clot on the market in Liupanshui, the city of Kujcsou, reported the case on Sunday in South China Morning Post.
A pig farmer is about to inject pigs in a farm in Xining, China, on 30 May 2005.
The man traveled with his cousin from the nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the fair.
The next morning, he found his cousin's body and discovered that his door was open from the neighboring pig.
According to his statement, the huge candidate in pigs had blood on his mouth.
According to the report, the expert study has found that indeed the 250-pound pig killed the farmer.
“My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated,” said Guiyang Evening News, a relative named Wu.
According to security footage, Yuan entered the pigs at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
The body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man wasn't owned by Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig was locked up so that others would not be harmed while the police were investigating the tracks on the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reporting that the compensation for the death of a man is currently being discussed.
Although not often, there have been reports of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on their massachusetts farm and caused life-threatening injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 200 - pound pig in Wales held a master on his tractor until the man’s wife managed to alarm him.
After a farmer in Oregon had his own pig food in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba spoke on the CBC News show that pigs are generally not prone to attack, but the taste of blood can become aggressive.
“Very players.
Like little kids, they're very interested... they don't want to hurt you.
All you have to do is give them the respect," he said.
Serious rainfalls following Hurricane Rosa in the South-West of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is getting weaker according to forecasts, as the colder waters of the northern part of Mexico rise above the colder waters.
However, in the coming days Rosa will continue to cause severe rainfall in the north-west and south-west parts of Mexico.
At 5 a.m. on Sunday morning at 5 a.m., Rosa struck as a hurricane of category 1 at 140 km/h, from Punta Eugenia in Mexico to 620 km southwest.
The hurricane is expected to be heading north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low air pressure zone is emerging above the Pacific Ocean and heading west towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches Lower California on Monday, tropical storms are flooding the Southwest regions of the United States with a heavy tropical humidity.
On Monday, the storm can bring up to 25 cm of rain into some parts of Mexico.
Then the tropical humidity of the approaching low-pressure masses will cause intense rainfalls in the coming days in the southwest.
Here the rain from 3 to 10 cm rain can cause sudden floods, ruins filled with floods, and landslides in the desert.
The heavy tropical humidity can also bring 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in the southern areas of Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, a rainfall of 5 cm to 10 cm is expected, especially in Arizona.
There may also be sudden floods with a rapid drop in intensity due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
During tropical rainfalls, it is not particularly recommended to walk in the desert.
Due to severe rainfalls, canyons can turn into raging rivers, and the zivatars are accompanied by sudden windfalls and dust clouds.
The approaching low-pressure masses can cause severe rainfall on the coast of Southern California.
A rain of up to 1.5 cm is possible, which can cause smaller floods filled with debris and flat road conditions.
This will be the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Dispersal tropical showers are available on Sunday evenings and Monday mornings in Arizona, then Mondays during the day and Tuesdays cover wider areas of rain.
Serious rainfall spreads to the four-sharp region on Tuesday, and lasts until Wednesday.
In October there will be intense temperature fluctuations in the United States, as Arctic air mass cools, but tropicals will remain fairly warm.
This may also lead to drastic temperature differences at short distances.
An excellent example of this is the situation in the central region of the United States on Sunday.
Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) as well as St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) are about 10 degrees of temperature variation.
In the coming days it is expected that even the summer heat will be felt again in larger areas.
In the central and eastern regions of the United States, it is expected that the temperature will be warm in the first half of October and will be around 25 to 30 degrees from the south of the Great Plains to certain parts of the Northwest.
The temperature in New York on Tuesday reaches 25 degrees, which will be about 5 degrees higher than the average.
According to the long-term weather forecast, the temperature in the east of the United States will likely exceed the average temperature by the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
In total, over 20 million viewers on six television channels were interested in the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, applying for the Supreme Court position, and the female accused of rape in the eighties, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political crisis has not been resolved, and the broadcasters have had to break up their regular stream due to the last-minute Friday's twist: Senator Jeff Flake has managed to get him a week to investigate the charges.
Ford told the Senate Court Committee that he was 100 percent sure that at a high school party, Kavanaugh would touch him and try to undress him.
In Kavanaugh's passionate testimony, he said that he was 100 percent certain that this had not happened.
The statements were probably seen by more than 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen on Friday.
Nielsen calculated on average with CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which were involved in the hearing, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen has difficulty measuring the number of people watching the programs at their workplace.
For the sake of comparison, so many viewers are the football finalists or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, which supported the appointment of Kavanaugh experts from all the channels, had the highest number of viewers with an average of 5,69 million viewers during the whole day’s interview.
In second place, ABC stands at 3,26 million viewers.
CBS 3.1, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89, CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen's report.
The interest was not reduced after the hearing.
The main character of the Friday drama was Senator Flake.
After the Office of the Moderate Republican Senator issued the statement that Senator Kavanaugh would vote, on Friday morning on the CNN and CBS show, as a loud crowd of protestors would receive it, as he sought the meeting of the court-martial committee on the elevator.
For minutes, he was watching the crowd scoff and CNN broadcast the scene on live television.
“I stand before you here,” said a woman to the senator.
Do you really think Kavanaugh is telling the truth before the country's public?"
Others shouted, "You have the power to do what so many women don't have."
All she said was that her office issued a statement and then added before closing the elevator door that she would be able to share what she had to say at the Commission hearing.
The cable and broadcasting channels were then seen live hours later, as the committee voted on whether to extend the nomination of Kavanaugh to the full Senate.
However, Flake said that he would only be willing to do so if the FBI were to investigate the charges against the candidate next week, as the democrats in the minority called for.
Flake's conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, have convinced him of this.
Flake decided to talk to Coons and later other senators.
It was clear that without the investigation, the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh's nomination.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses the opponents of Brexit with political play
In the Sunday Times interview, Prime Minister Theresa May accused her plans to leave the European Union of jeopardising the future of the United Kingdom and undermining the interests of the nation.
The UK Prime Minister Theresa May will arrive at the Conservative Party's birmingham conference on 29 September 2018.
In another interview directly next to May's interview, May's former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, attacks May's "Chequers" plan for Brexit, saying that the idea of managing the customs duties of Great Britain and the EU is "absolutely absurd".
The Wayde Sims murder: The police arrested Dyteon Simpson with the murder of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect in the murder of Wayde Sims, 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University (LSU).
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested on charges of attempted murder, reports the police captain of Baton Rouge.
The police released the video of the battle between Sims and Simpson and reported that Sims' glasses fell during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene, and they found Simpson's DNA on it, on the CBS network, on the WAFB channel.
After he was questioned, the police announced that the young man admitted he shot Sims.
According to Advocate's report, the bail was set at $350 000.
According to a preliminary report from the county coroner of East Baton Rouge on Friday, the cause of death is a gunshot wound affecting both the head and neck.
The Bureau thanked the State Police in Louisiana for the assistance they have in the investigation leading to the arrest of the suspect, the forensics lab of the state police, the university police and the residents of the area.
The Athletic Director of LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the competent law enforcement forces for their "committed and sustained work in finding out the truth".
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-meter-high attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also the basket of LSU.
Sims reached 5,6 points per game in the last season and 2,6 points in the last season.
On Friday morning, the basketball coach of LSU, Will Wade, said that the news of Sims' death had "smoke" and "smacked" the team.
“Man is always afraid that something like this will happen,” Wade said.
Volcanian floods Mexico City with ash
The ash that fired Popocatepetl from the volcano reached the southern districts of the Mexican capital.
After the volcanic activity increased in the crater and a total of 183 gas and ash discharges took place within 24 hours, the national disaster prevention centre asked the Mexican population to stay away from the volcano.
The Centre also observed several screams and quakes.
The images shown on the social portals in some districts of Mexico City, such as Xochimillco, cover the windshields of cars with thin hare.
The geophysics observed an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km south-east of the Mexican capital, following an earthquake of 7.1 strength in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
The police collided with Catalan separatists on the anniversary of the independence referendum.
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after independence protestors collided with the police and thousands joined the rival demonstrations on the first anniversary of the referendum on the breakdown of Catalonia.
A group of powerful separatists threw eggs and paint powder at the attack officers, so the streets with tourists were now covered with dense powder.
In the later part of the day, further fights broke out during which the police tried to maintain the order with rubber bottling.
The "We do not forget, we do not forgive" symbolic independence groups and unit protestors behind the "Live Spain" symbol stood against each other for hours.
According to local press reports, fourteen people were killed with minor injuries during the demonstrations.
The tension continues to decrease in the region of independence through the referendum on 1 October, which was recognised as illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by the Catalan separatist.
The voters voted with a large majority in favour of the break-up, although the participation rate was rather low, as the majority of the Unionists boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people suffered injuries last year when the police tried to stop voting in polling stations through aggressive collisions.
The independence parties were on the street all night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
Although it has not been prevented, the demonstration was finally not on the normal course.
According to a 68-year-old electrician of Narcis Termes, participating in separatist demonstrations, there is no chance that Catalonia will gain independence.
“Kavaly was one of the best times of our lives.
I saw my parents tearing down tears of joy, for which we can vote, but now our cause has failed," he said.
Although the regional elections last December have succeeded in achieving an essential, even if a narrow victory is achieved, Catalan independence parties will find it difficult to maintain their momentum this year after many of their most well-known leaders have taken up voluntary exiles or are expected to be arrested for their role in the organisation of referendums and in the subsequent proclamation of independence.
According to a 42-year-old car manufacturer who recorded the protest against the police, Joan Puig, the conflict was fired on both sides by politicians.
“The situation is getting more tense,” he says.
A Catalan leader who has been waiting for negotiations since last year, Oriol Junqueras, announced on Saturday that he would be going to the European Parliament elections next year.
"I can only reject the devaluation of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish Government represents if I participate as candidates in the European elections", she said.
Londonderry: The police arrested three men driving their cars into a house.
The police arrested a 33, 34 and 39-year-old man who drove his car to Londonderry several times in a house.
The incident happened at the Ballynagard Crescent around 7:30 in the summertime.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building itself were damaged.
They might have shot the car with a tool at a given moment.
Menga scored 1-0 on Livingston's Rangers team
Dolly Menga's first goal was to secure Livingston's victory
In the first class, Livingston brought a great surprise to the Rangers team by getting Steven Gerrard to his second defeat, who has been working as a coach at the ibrox club since the 18th game.
Dolly Menga's goal was to make the real difference because Gary Holt's team was in competition with the Hibernian team in second place.
So the Gerrards continued to remain undefeated in the current season of the Scottish League, and next Sunday they are facing the First Hearts team, who are eight points behind.
Before that, however, Rangers will still have a match in the European League against Rapid Wien on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has increased its division series to six wins, which means that Kenny Miller's replacement last month, Holt, hasn't got the team yet.
Livingston missed a number of situations against an imprecise guest team
Holt's team could have taken the lead long before the only goal of the game, because their offensive game has caused few problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the enemy's defense, but he pulled the attack too far, and then Alan Lithgow's attempt proved to be wide after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's ball in front of his goalline.
The domestic team allowed the Rangers to play their own game because they were sure that they could disrupt the guests in fixed play situations.
The final goal was born from a situation exactly like this.
The Rangers had a free kick and Livingston found a gap in his defense. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created a situation for Menga, who took advantage of it from the middle of the 16th.
At this stage of the game, the Rangers led the ball, but domestic protection was still impenetrable, and Liam Kelly's gate was hardly compromised.
This trend continued during the second half of the game, except in one situation when Kelly had to protect Alfredo Morelos's attack.
Scott Pittman's attempt on the Rangers' gate, Allan McGregor's foot, and Lithgow's turned into another free kick in Livingston.
The cross-directive balls have constantly arrived in Livingston sixteen, but the defenders have been forced every time. There are two criminals not received by the attack team: one of the entrances of Halkett against Glenn Middleton as a replacement player, and the other of them because of the guarantee.
"Fine" game from Livingston – game analysis
Tony Macaron is from Arena Alasdair Lamont, reporter at BBC Scotland
Livingston provided phenomenal performance and lepered the bakers.
The players played well from one to the next, and in line with the expectations.
The team's members and game style have barely changed since they got back to the top, but Holt's efforts deserve serious recognition, because since the coach arrived, he's been pushing the team up.
Several players have brought their finest form.
Captain Hal two formed a great team with excellent protection, and Menga gave Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall a good sweat.
The Rangers played without an idea.
As well as they're occasionally under Gerrard's leadership, they just couldn't bring that level.
The last shot was always missing from the formula – and they only failed once to break domestic protection – so the Rangers must get together quickly, because they slipped back to the middle of the field.
Erdo's mixed reception in Cologne
It was a pleasant atmosphere and a pleasure for the leaders of Turkey and Germany to meet in the morning on Saturday (September 29) in Berlin.
This was the last day of his visit to Germany, which shared Erdo's, with the aim of improving relations between NATO countries.
The relationship has deteriorated between the two countries due to issues relating to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU membership.
He then traveled to Cologne to celebrate a newly built, huge mosque opening ceremony.
The city of Cologne is home to the largest community of Turks living outside Turkey.
The police banned the gathering of 25,000 people before the mosque for security reasons, but many of the president's supporters appeared to see the Turkish Head of State.
In addition, hundreds of anti- Erdo'an protestors, including a number of Kurds, expressed their disregard for Erdo's policy and the fact that the German government decided to take the Prime Minister's seat.
The two opposing protests are a great example of the sharing of the President's policy, which some German citizens of Turkish origin celebrate as a hero, while others see an autocrat in it.
Road accident in Deptford: a bicycle hit a car and lost his life
He lost a biker when he ran into a car in London.
The crash took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a major road in the south-east of Deptford, at about 10:15 local time.
The driver of the passenger car stopped, and the bombers tried to help the bike, who, however, lost his life at the scene.
The collision took place just a few months after another bicycle hit-and-run hit-and-run on Childers Street, just a mile from the location of the accident on Saturday.
According to the London Police Department's statement, the police continue to work to establish the identity of the man so they can inform the relatives.
As a result of the investigation, roadblocks and bus transfers make transport difficult, and the authorities advise drivers to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six prison guards injured during a riot
Six prison guards were injured by a heavily guarded man in prison during an outbreak, announced by the prison director's office.
The riots began at 09:30 a.m. in Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday morning, and they have not yet managed to contain them.
In order to deal with the situation, the competent authorities have placed the special line named “Tornado” on the site. Eight prisoners are involved in the riots, who have been repressed into a building wing.
The members of the special scheme suffered only minor head injuries that were carried out at the site.
Statement by the Sanctions Committee spokesperson: “A specially trained prison guard is handling the situation in Long Lartin Prison.
Six members of the team had to be treated for injury.
We don't tolerate violence at any level in our prisons, we're going to turn those responsible over to the police, and they're going to be charged with another prison sentence."
In the Long Lartin male prison, over 500 prisoners are held, among whom are the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the warden had to be hospitalized after one of the prisoners attacked him.
Last October, too, a special task force was needed to overcome a serious disturbance in which prisoners attacked the prison staff with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with a sudden flood (but the situation can improve in affected areas)
Arizona is rarely reached by tropical depression, but this is what the state is expected to be counting on at the beginning of next week when the remaining hurricane named Rosa is sweeping through the desert in the south-west, dramatically increasing the risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorological Service has ordered flooding from West Arizona to the south and east of Nevada for Monday and Tuesday, as well as south-east California and Utah; the preparedness also affects the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to pass through Phoenix on Tuesday, where it is expected that it will arrive at Monday night and bring with it great rains.
The Phoenix meteorological service published the following message on Twitter: “Since 2050, ten tropical cyclones have reached within the 200 miles [200 km] of Phonenix as a tropical storm or depression!
For example, Hurricane Katrina approached the border for 40 miles (1967).
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre predict a rainfall of 50 to 100 mm, which can reach 150 mm in extreme cases, such as Mogolon Rim, Arizona.
In other parts of the southern desert (Central Areas of the Nordic Mountains, Great Basin, etc.) a rainfall of 25-50 mm can be expected, but in some places 100 mm can be expected.
The rain that Rosa has brought can bring relief to areas that are not threatened with lightning water, as the region is currently suffering from severe drought.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some rainfalls can have a beneficial effect on the south-west regions affected by the flood.
“The U.S. drought monitoring service provides that more than 40% of Arizona’s territory is affected by the minimum extreme drought, which is the second most dangerous category,” says Weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will first land on the South California peninsula of Mexico.
It remains hurricane-like, and on Sunday morning, bringing up to 137 km/h wind, it goes about 600 km south of the Mexico Punta Eugenia land language, and will be heading about 19 km/h north.
The storm meets colder currents on the Pacific Ocean, and it will lose its power.
Thus, it is expected that the coasts of Mexico will return as a tropical storm in the afternoon or in the evening hours.
In some areas of Mexico, frequent rainfall can be expected, which significantly increases the chances of flooding.
“Averaging rains can result in an average of 70-150 mm rainfall from Lower California to the Northwest of Sonora, where 250 mm rain may fall”, says Weather.com.
Rosa then moves on as a tropical storm to the north of Mexico before, on Tuesday, the early hours of the morning, reaching Arizona, in the form of tropical depression, to reach the south of Utah by swept through Arizona, on Tuesday night.
"The greatest threat caused by Rosa and its remains in Lower California, Northwest Sonora, and in the southwest desert regions of the United States will be extreme rainfall," said the National Hurricane Centre.
Rainfalls are expected to cause life-threatening lightning discharges and floods in desert areas and landfalls in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four people arrested with suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested with suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
On Saturday, at 4 p.m. local time, a injured teenage boy was found in the district of Midsomer Norton Excelsior Terrace.
The boy was immediately moved to the hospital, his condition is "stable".
According to the police's statement, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and 20-year-old men were arrested in Radstock, Avon, and Somerset during the night.
The authorities ask the public to contact them if anyone has a mobile phone record of what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh had to suffer "the evil spirit and anger of the Democratic Party"
“He who vote for Judge Kavanaugh will vote against the ruthless and disgusting tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
According to Trump, Kavanaugh's nomination for the Democratic Party had to suffer "the evil spirit and anger of the Democratic Party".
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, where he strongly and passionately denied Christine Blasey Ford's claim that he committed sexual violence as a teenager decades earlier.
At the hearing, Ford testified and stood by his earlier claims.
On Saturday, the president said that “Americans could see it with their own eyes” that day, Kavanaugh’s “a brilliant and intrepid character”.
“The votes with Judge Kavanaugh have been cast in addition to one of the best legal experts of our time, who has an unmaculated public service history,” said Trump’s Western Virginia supporters.
The president also referred to Mr Kavanaugh's nomination as to how important it was for the Republican voters to take part in the interim elections.
“Just five weeks apart from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don't go in person, but I'm going in essence, he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere to support the best candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats were following the tactics of 'discrimination and obstacle'.
The first Senate vote on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, and a leading Republican consultant has announced to CNN.
Hundreds of people were killed in an earthquake in Indonesia, and the number of dead people is rising
Many were driven by the price and at least 384 people lost their lives when the huge waves reached the shore. The disaster was caused by a strong earthquake and a flood on the island of Sulawes, Indonesia, and the local authorities declared on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at the festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when the nearly six meters (18 feet) of high waves reached the shore, many were swept away and destroyed.
The flood price was triggered by an earthquake of 7.5.
“When the exhaust observation was voiced yesterday, people simply stayed on the beach, they did not escape directly, so the waves became a victim,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian Disaster Response Agency (BNPB) at the Jakarta press conference.
“The fountain didn’t just come on its own, moving cars, log, houses and everything else from the beach,” Nugroho said, and added that the tsunami was moving at a speed of 800 km/h on the open sea before reaching the beach.
There were those who climbed from the price to the top of the trees and escaped, he said.
About 16 700 people have been evacuated to 24 shelters, please.
A number of destroyed buildings and offices, several twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water, are seen in the air footage released by the Agency.
On Saturday, further post-arrangements shook the coastal city.
Earthquakes could be detected in an area about 2.4 million people live in.
According to the statement by the Technology Assessment and Application Agency of Indonesia (BPPT), in the course of the Friday earthquake, approximately 200 times more energy was released than that of Hiroshima in World War II.
The Agency added that the city is located at the end of a long and narrow bay and that the geographical characteristics resulting from it could have reinforced the influence of the fountain.
According to Nugroho, the damage caused is “important” and thousands of houses were destroyed in the disaster and hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
Several victims' bodies were found in the ruins of the collapsed buildings, he said, and then added that the number of victims has been 540, and they're looking for 29 more.
According to Nugroho's statement, the number of injured persons and the damage caused in the area called Donggala on the coast of Palu 300 km (190 km) from Palu may be even greater, as it was closer to the earthquake epicentrum.
The communication was "extremely paralyzed, unable to get information" about Donggala, said Nugroho.
"There are more than 300 000 people living there", in the Red Cross Communication, which also announced that experts and volunteers of the organisation are already on their way to the disaster affected area.
"The situation is already tragic, but it can be much worse", he was added.
The Agency received a number of criticisms on Saturday that it did not inform the population of the Palut attacking exodus, but according to the management, the waves already reached the coast when the alarm was issued.
On the social media, a man is seen in an amateur video trying to warn the people on the street of the approaching fountain with desperate cries from the top floor of a building.
In a few minutes, a huge water wall will hit the beach, moving cars and buildings with you.
The Reuters News Agency couldn't prove the authenticity of the recording for now.
The earthquake and the flood caused a power outage, making it impossible to communicate around Palu, making it more difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue work.
The army sent a shipment of assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but the authorities believe that the evacuated population will continue to need food and other essential supplies.
The airport of the city was opened only in order to facilitate aid works and will be closed until October for all other purposes.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centres set up on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian exodus exceeds 800.
It's really bad.
The World Vision team arrived safely from Donggala to the city of Palu, where employees found refuge under tents set up in the court of the office, but during their journey they found signs of terrible destruction, said Doseba.
“They said they saw a lot of houses destroyed, ” he added.
- It's very bad."
While relief teams were helping to prepare disaster response work, some complained that foreign professionals with high experience in this area could not travel to Palura.
According to Indonesian regulations, any aid, relief and staff coming from overseas can only be admitted to the territory of the country if the location of the accident is declared a disaster at national level.
That hasn't happened so far.
“The case will continue to be treated as a state-wide disaster,” said Aulia Arrian, a spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
– Once the government recognises that it is indeed a national disaster, we can let the international relief services in, but no notification has yet been made."
On the second night after the Friday quake and the fountain, please continue to hope that their loved ones will be among those who have some sort of a miracle-savering escape in the dark atmosphere of reports of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the canal during his rescue.
On Sunday, the workers were able to free a woman who had fallen victim to ruin her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian National Scenario team, prepared two contestants of the missing Scenarios for the Asian Games, which this time were held in Indonesia, completed at the beginning of the month.
In addition to the missing, other students stayed at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi.
“As a water slider, what has happened has a great spiritual burden on me,” he said.
Gendon recalled that when the news of Roa Roa Hotel's collapse began to spread between the skyscrapers, for hours he desperately tried to reach the competitors who were at the beach festival, please.
In addition to the messages, however, only one grey pipe appeared instead of two blue pipe.
“I suppose that means that the messages could no longer be delivered,” he said.
$26 750 was taken while a bank machine was uploaded at the Newport on the Levee mall.
On Friday morning, thieves took 26 750 dollars from one of Brink’s’s employees, who was filling an ATM with cash in the Newport on the Levee mall, in the press release of the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the money transport car just emptied a ATM in the entertainment center, and he was about to fill it up with additional banknotes, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the notice.
A man “approached the Brink’s employee from behind” while he was busy with his work and stole one of his prepared bags.
Witnesses saw several suspected suspects running away from the scene, but the police statement does not contain the exact number of suspects.
Anyone who would provide information on the identity of the perpetrators may contact the Newport police on the 859-292-3680 phone number.
Kanye West: the rapper name Yéra changed
Kanye West, the rapper's name is Ye now.
The change was announced on Saturday on Twitter with the following message: "The creature previously called Kanye West."
For some time, the 41 - year - old Westet was called Ye, and his eighth album, published in June, had its title.
He announced the name change before his Saturday Night Live performance, where he is expected to present a new Yandhi album.
In the show Ariana Grande will replace her, who, referring to the "emotional reasons", gave up the performance, said the producer of the show.
The new name is not only a shortening of the current name of the rapper – according to previous announcements, West is also of religious importance.
“I know that “Ye” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and it means “you” in the Bible,” said West earlier, when he spoke about his album’s address with Big Boy’s radio broadcaster.
- So it's me and me and we're all one.
Kanye means it's the only one, and it just becomes Ye, which represents the good in us, the bad, the confusion, everything.
The album rather reflects who we really are."
Ye is one of those famous rappers who predispose to change their names.
For example, Sean Combs has been running under the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he has now preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
His former co-founder, JAY-Z, also varied several times by the need to write his name in capital letters, bonds and letters.
The Mexican president has promised not to launch an army against civilians.
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexican president, promised to never use the military against civilians in connection with the coming 50th anniversary of the student medals in the bloodbath.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use the army to suppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, military troops opened fire on the square to participants in a peaceful demonstration, causing the deaths of some 300 people, when left-wing student movements showed signs of reinforcement in Latin America.
López Obrador promised to help young people in Mexico – it provides monthly financial benefits to students and plans to establish additional free state universities.
It argued that unemployment and the lack of education are the two main factors that drive young people into the arms of criminal organisations.
The US should double the funding framework for MI solutions
As China becomes increasingly active in the research and development of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its support for such research, said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and application of artificial intelligence solutions, who used to work for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He then said that the U.S. government made notifications about artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have an official MI strategy.
Meanwhile, China has announced its related plans: the country's goal is to become the world's number one MI developer by 2030.
"Dualising the cost framework for the MI studies would be a good start, as all other countries are significantly behind the US and the next breakthrough in the MI area is imminent," said Lee.
The possibility that the next major step in the field of artificial intelligence could be taken by doubled research aid could be doubled by the United States in its interview with the CNBC.
Lee, whose book entitled “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures. The company made investments in one of China's most significant companies dealing with MI, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an MI system that managed to defeat the best American player Othello and later worked as a member of the Microsoft Research Board and as president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee acknowledged the results of the technology competitions previously announced by the US Government, including the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next event would take place, because it would be possible to explore the new shape of the future.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain the public support they need for their research, said Lee.
He added: “It is not China that acidifies scientific leadership, it is the large companies,” he added.
Over recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have signed several large university skulls to work in the field of MI.
According to Lee, an amendment to immigration policy could also greatly help the US's efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think you should automatically get a green card for those with a doctorate in artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China announced its plan for the development of next generational artificial intelligence.
China's national natural science foundation supports staff of academic institutions in similar ways as the US National Science Fund (NSF) and other government organisations share money with American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower," Lee explained.
This year, the US Department of Defence established Joint Artificial Intelligence Center MI, where various industry professionals and academics can work together, and the White House announced the establishment of a committee called Select Committee on Artistic Intelligence.
This month, DARPA invested $2 billion in an AI Next initiative,
The NSF currently spends USD 100 million a year to support MI research.
Meanwhile, the United States of America's legislation, which envisaged the establishment of a National Security MI Committee, has not taken any further steps in the interests of the matter for months.
Macedonia has a referendum on changing the name of the country
The population of Macedonia voted in the Sunday referendum on whether to change the name of the country to the ‘Night Macedonian Republic’. This step would lead to a decades of disagreement with Greece, which prevented the country's acceptance of its application for EU membership and NATO.
Greece, whose territory is called Macedonia, argued that the name of its neighbour in the north indicates that it is demanding a similar Greek territory, and so far it has vetoed NATO and EU membership.
In June, the two governments negotiated on the state's new name, but according to national sentimental opponents, the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of most Slavic people in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not participate in the referendum, and as a result of the boycott campaign launched, it became questionable whether the 50% participation required for the valid referendum will be achieved.
The question on the voting notes is as follows: "Does the country support NATO and EU membership and accept the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price should be paid in order to ensure that Macedonia, as one of the countries that have risen in the ruins of Yugoslavia, has a chance of EU and NATO membership.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it would mean a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska (79) in Skopsia.
Although referendums in themselves are not legally binding, sufficient parliamentary members have declared that they feel bound to have the result of the vote.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the state electoral committee, no irregularities were reported until 13:00 on the day of the vote.
However, the participation rate has only reached 16% until the point. This value was 34% in the 2016 parliamentary elections (which ultimately represented 66% of the registered voters).
“I have come to vote for my children because we have a place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski (62), who voted in the capital of Skopsia.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, wife of Zorica, and son of Dushko, elected for the name change at the referendum on 30 September 2018, which would allow the country to join the EU and NATO.
In Skop, in front of Parliament's building, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) set up a small stage and chairs and tents for those who cast the referendum.
“We also support NATO and EU membership of the country, but we want to join with a proud, raised head, not through the door of the chatter,” said Kavaldarkov.
– We are a poor country, but we have not lost our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, then we can also turn to China or Russia as part of Eurazian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership could account for investments that a country with a higher unemployment rate than 20% needs.
"I think that the majority will support our cause, because more than 80% of the population in the country is basically in favour of EU and NATO membership," said Zaev, after he gave his vote.
He also added that the vote 'yes' means 'ensurement of the future of the country'.
According to the results of a survey published last Monday by a political research institute in Macedonia, 30-43% of voters are expected to participate in the referendum, which is lower than the required participation rate.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV suggests a 57% participation rate on Sunday.
For those of you who want to vote, 70% said he'd vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the participation rate must be more than 50% by at least one vote.
The invalidity of referendums would be the first serious blow to the West Party government, which came to power last May.
Video: Sergio Aguero, the Manchester City player, gets a goal with full Brighton protection
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling have dealt well with the protection of Brighton, so Manchester City won a 2-0 victory on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in England.
Aguero got his shot goal at 65 minutes as if it was the easiest thing in the world.
The Argentinian Battle was the first step of the attack on the midfield received a pass, and
He was able to get out of the open field with the three Brighton protectors.
That's when four green fields surrounded Aguero.
He rang a protector and then ran more and more close to Brighton 16.
Then it passed to the left for the Sterling that showed up there.
The English Battle has given the ball back to Aguero with force within the 16th, who has finished the operation with a right foot, hitting the right side of Mathew Ryan's Gate of Brighton.
“Aguero has problems with his feet,” said reporters, the manager of Pep Guardiola, Manchester City.
– We agreed that you can play 55 minutes, up to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
Fortunately, that's when he got a score."
The initial advantage of Sterling's action was gained by the blues at the English championship.
The goal was born at 29 minutes, when
Aguero, who is on the square of the Brightons, received a great pass.
He started a beautiful crossball to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane played the ball for a while before starting Sterling for the long haul.
The Blue Battle just got the ball into the gate before it slipped off the base line.
Next Tuesday, 12:55 p.m., City is playing with the Hoffenheim team in the League of Champions in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make things harder for Rockies.
Since the Nationals team missed the possibility of entering the afterseason, there was no reason for them to make a real effort.
However, Scherzer, who is always competitive, is looking forward to taking a stand against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the opponent team still has a chance to play it. Rockies has a fighting advantage in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West Baseball League.
Rockies secured at least one comforting place with the Nationals' 5-2 victory on Friday night, but the first division address is still waiting for you.
“No matter how we no longer have a chance, we can stand against them, that the mood of the audience and the other team in Denver are expected to be at the top of the year.
Of course I'm in the mood to get on the track."
The Nationals team still needs to pick out the beginner for Sunday, but according to the news, in this situation, Scherzer will be the drummer.
Scherzer, who took a throwout on Thursday, will be his 34th starting shot on Sunday, which is usually his day of rest.
The right-handed Washington player will be standing after the 220 and 2/3 part of the season with 18-7, 2,53 ERA and 300 strikeouts.
Trump campaigning in West Virginia
The president also referred to the situation with the Supreme Judge, Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of the Republican voters' participation in the interim elections.
“In November, everything we have done is at stake.
We're only five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the big ones, the big ones – I don't go in person, but I'm going in essence, which is why I'm going everywhere to support the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “Everyone can see what these terrible radical democracies are doing with their own eyes.
They are truly determined, and they are able to put in place any means to regain power, can see evil and altruism.
It doesn't matter who's hurt who's left to have control, they have power, they want control and power, but we don't leave ourselves."
According to the President, the Democrats are putting in motion "obstacles and obstacles".
“They could have seen all this in the last four days,” he said, “above and evil and mean and lying” calling the Democrats.
He also mentioned Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Court of Justice Committee, who, at his hearing, declared the loud disapproval of the gathered crowd.
“Do they still remember what he said?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, what?
No, no, no, wait – all this with very bad body language, it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer supports diversity.
It does not tolerate those who freely say what they think
I wasn't surprised when my own party decided to censor the Momentum activists for my censorship.
After all, I am only the last in a long line of Labour representatives who have been told that they are not welcome, simply because we have said what we think.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, has been treated in a similar way because he has stood up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship didn't like the fact that I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
Moreover, the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, which, ironically, are the issues in which Jeremy also disagreed with previous leaders.
At the Labour Meeting held in Nottingham East on Friday, it was said that they would like a "receptive and productive meeting".
For the majority of my eight years as a local representative of the Labour Party, these Friday night meetings were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, however, today's sound has changed, and the promise of a more reclusive, polite policy has been forgotten if ever it has come to fruition.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that the Labour Party does not tolerate differing views and all opinions are judged to be acceptable to the leadership of the Party.
This trend began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the couple, and I thought that our political attitude had been similar to that recently, that I should turn my back on my individual opinion and take a position on things I would never agree with anyway, whether it be national security issues or the single European market.
After all my public speeches, regardless of what I have actually said, they're starting to jerk off social media, they're calling for my resignation, they're criticising the policy that is in the middle, and they're telling me that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
This isn't just happening to me.
In fact, I know that I am luckier than many of my colleagues, because the comments to me tend to focus on politics.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my political colleagues who are forced to endure sexist and racist attacks on a daily basis, but they do not run.
The most disappointing aspect of today's policy is that attacks at this level have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should support the culture of tolerance.
The reality, however, is that we have given up diversity, and with all the 'infidelity' initiative and all the changes to the electoral rules, there is a growing decline in the party's tolerance.
Over the last few years, many have advised me to hold back, not be so eloquent, and then "all will be fine".
However, that is not why I have taken a political course.
32 years ago, I joined the Labour Party as a student because I was upset that the government of Thatcher neglected schools so much that our classroom almost collapsed and then I fought for a better approach as a local councillor and as a government minister for the most needy.
I never hid my political views, and I did nothing else in my last election.
In Nottingham East, it was quite clear to everyone what political positions I represent and in which areas I do not agree with the current management.
For those who supported the motion on Friday, I do not understand why it has to spend so much time and energy in this situation, when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm not only families, but also companies and public services, to question my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
However, my most important message is not for the Nottingham Momentum members, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that any threat of redemption or political orientation will not prevent me from acting at my own discretion and in the interests of everyone.
Chris Leslie, representative of Nottingham East
Ayr–Melrose 38-17: Ayr breaks to the top unbeatably
Two late attempts have been slightly modified in the end result, but there is no doubt that Ayr has earned its victory at the most entertaining game of the day, the Tennent‘s Premiership.
The team is currently at the top of the table, the only ten teams unbeatable.
Thanks to their unique protection and their lofty use of the situation, the Hungarians and Coach Peter Murchie have every reason to be satisfied.
"We had to face many challenges in our games so far, but we are still unbeatable, so I have every reason to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, the player of Melrose, said: “We have to admit that Ayr has made much better use of his situation than we have.”
With Grant Anderson's 14-minute experiment, of which Frazier Climo scored, Ayr was given an advantage. Thanks to the yellow card to the Scottish captain Rory Hughes borrowed by the Warriors, Melrose could have overcome the difference, but Jason Baggot's attempt did not make a point.
Climo was smoking the Ayr's defense with a criminal, and then he got a point from a one-man experiment, so the first half ended with a 17-5 result in Ayr's benefit.
Melrose started his second half, Patrick Anderson's attempt to sell Baggot to five points, reducing the team's disadvantages.
Then the game stood for a long time because Ruaridh Knott suffered serious injury and had to be taken off the track, and in the continuation Ayr continued to increase its advantage by trying to get Stafford McDowall, whose bakers managed to reap with the help of Climo.
Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, also received a yellow card, and then Melrose managed to stop Bruce Colvine's experiment in man's upper hand, thus breaking the pressure on them.
The domestic team started catching up again, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for putting Climo down without a ball, MacPherson introduced a touch down behind the Ayr Attack Team.
Climo sold it, which he repeated almost immediately after the reboot, when Kyle Rowe took off David Armstrong's high kicks and sent Gregor Henry forward to try his fifth home.
Still Game is a new career in the hospitality industry.
It seems that one of Still Game's stars, Ford Kieran, is moving towards the catering industry: it turns out that a restaurant has been put at the head of the company.
The 56-year-old actor Jack Jarvis plays in the popular series of BBC, which he writes together and plays with his old comedy partner Greg Hemhill.
The couple announced that the next nine season would be the end of the year and that Kiernan was planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he became the director of the Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not comment on the news, although a source of Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan was trying to benefit from Glasgow's "flouring catering industry".
"The Sea is ours": Bolivia, without the coast, hopes that the court will reopen the way for the Pacific
Marines patrol the sailed Navy Command in La Paz.
There are ocean blue flags in the middle.
Maritime bases from Lake Titica to Amazon declare: “We have a right to the sea.
It's our duty to get it back."
In Bolivia, without the coast, the memory of the lost coast, taken by Chile in a bloody conflict for resources in the 19th century, is still alive, and the desire to re-wind the waves of the Pacific is strong.
For many decades, these hopes may have been the most powerful, for Bolivia is waiting for the judgment of the International Court of Justice to be closed for five years in October.
“Bolivia has the ball that floods people with the spirit of belonging and peace, who are in a positive mood waiting for the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a diplomat in Bolivia.
Many Bolivian observers follow the decision of the International Court of Justice, hoping that the Hague Court will stand next to Bolivia, and Chile will be forced to sit at a conference table after decades of rapsodilism so that Bolivia can have independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, a charismatic, indigenous President of Bolivia, who is facing a controversial battle that he must continue for the reelection next year, can lose a lot with the Monday judgment.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide for Bolivia, and that would not change much if its decision was still favourable to Bolivia.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no right to judge over Chilean territories, and it also presupposes that it will not influence the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice was born just six months after the closing remarks indicates that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chinese expert in international law.
Moreover, for the last four years, he did not help Bolivia's case, but even reversed it.
"The issue of maritime exit was reversed by the current government of Bolivia for its own purposes," Zárate explained.
– because of Morales' hostile rhetoric, the Chilean remnant of charity were lost."
Bolivia and Chile will certainly continue negotiations at one point, but it will be extremely difficult to initiate dialogue after what has happened.
Since 1962, the two countries have not delegated ambassadors to each other.
The former president, Eduardo Rodriguez Veltz, representative of Bolivia in the Hague, disagrees with the finding that judicial decision-making would have been unusually rapid.
For Bolivia, Monday is a “exceptional opportunity for a new chapter to be opened in relations with Chile”, and a chance for both to come out of “the closing of 139 years of conflict,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, would have used the maritime debate to make it political advantage.
“Bolivia will never give up her right to the Pacific,” she added.
– The judgment gives us the opportunity to see that it is time to go beyond the past."
North Korea: No nuclear decommissioning until they can trust America
Ri Jongho, North Korean Foreign Minister, said that his country will not be the first to surrender its nuclear weapons if they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke Saturday before the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep its promises at the Singapore Summit of leaders from the two rival countries.
The comment was made when it seemed that Mike Pompeo, the US Secretary of State, was able to reinstate the frozen nuclear talks more than three months after the summit with the North Korean leader Kim Dzsongun.
According to Ri, I wish to believe that the American obstacle to continuous sanctions and the declaration of the end of the Korean war will ever be enough to force North Korea to its knees.
Washington is waiting to accept the statement if Phenjan doesn't take any significant steps towards de-commissioning.
Both Kim Jsongun and American President Donald Trump want a new summit.
However, wide-ranging scepticism calls for Phenjan's commitment to reducing the arsenal, which is likely to be the only key to the country's security.
Pompeo is planning a phenomena visit next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
At the fashion shows in Paris, the huge headgear that will soon appear in top-class stores
If you want to expand your hat collection or want to completely cover the day, you do not have to search anymore.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of unusually oversized headgear as part of their spring/nature collection in 2019, which was welcomed with great enthusiasm by the stylish audience of the Paris Fashion Week.
Unpractice hats created sensations on Instagram in the summer, and the above fashion designers also put their remarkable works on the runway.
Valentino's most spectacular piece was an overcrowded beige hat, which was decorated with feathers like a wide karma, and almost completely swallowed up the heads of the models.
Among the other oversized supplements were precious greeks, a magical base, and even a pineapple, which were not designed to keep the human head warm.
Plus, Thom Browne came up with a range of bizarre masks, just before Halloween.
More of the colored masks were sewn together, and they reminded me of Hannibal Lecter rather than Haute couture.
One of them looked like a dive mask, plus pipe and glasses, and the other one looked like an ice cream of a melting funnel.
If you come in with these spectacular pieces, you're lucky.
Style analysts predict that huge hats may be on their way to top-class clothing stores.
The oversized hats follow the path of La Bomba, a 60 cm wide-ranging straw hat that everyone has seen from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the socialist hat, which conquers social sites, presented another piece on the runway: a beach bag made of straw, almost the size of the model of the bathing suit.
The dark orange rafias bag – decorated by rafias and on top of it has a white leather grip – was one of the outstanding pieces of Jacques's Spring/Spring La Riviera collection in 2019 in Paris in the fashion week.
The stylist of the stars, Luke Armitage, said to FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags to appear next summer in top class clothing stores. The designer has produced an elemental effect that would be difficult to deny the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language knowledge is essential for world citizens
The Scottish independent schools traditionally provide excellent education. In view of the new outstanding exam results, this situation has not changed to 2018, which is further reinforced by individual and group successes in sports, arts, music and other community initiatives.
In Scotland, more than 30,000 students have studied in such institutions, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), which aim to provide the best possible services to students and parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare students for further education, higher education, their chosen careers and their position as citizens of the world.
In an educational sector where the design and introduction of customized school curriculums is possible, modern languages continue to be popular and sought subjects.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak in a language that you understand, it will reach his head.
But if you speak his language, it will reach his heart."
This is an important reminder because we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with those from other countries.
This year's exam results show that students from independent schools across the country have produced the best results from foreign languages.
68 per cent of all students studying foreign language reached a higher degree A (more than 85 per cent).
Based on data collected from SCIS 74 member schools, 72% of students received a higher degree in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French and 63% of Spanish students reached A.
These results also show that independent schools in Scotland view foreign languages as essential knowledge, which will undoubtedly require knowledge of children and young people in the future.
Today, languages as chosen objects have become as important as natural sciences, technology, technical sciences and mathematics, both independently and in other types of schools.
In 2014, the UK Employment and Training Committee survey showed that 17% of employers were faced with difficulties in filling vacancies due to lack of language knowledge.
We can also see that language knowledge is increasingly necessary for young people to have a successful career.
As knowledge of foreign languages is increasingly required in more and more workplaces, language knowledge is essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career one chooses, if he learns a foreign language, he acquires a lifelong knowledge of which he has a clear advantage.
The ability to communicate directly with other nationalities automatically confers a competitive advantage on applicants speaking more than one language.
According to YouGov’s survey, where 4,000 adults were interviewed in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of respondents were not able to speak in any foreign language enough to speak with others, and France was the only language spoken by more than 10% (15 percent).
That is why it is important that we continue to put emphasis on the teaching of languages to children.
Speak more languages, especially in the language of developing countries, can be a tool in the hands of children to apply for more important jobs as an adult.
In every school in Scotland, they will deal with different languages.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while many will teach languages such as Mandarin or Japanese, which are expected to be of outstanding importance to the United Kingdom by 2020.
Whatever the area of interest of the child, you will be able to learn several languages at independent schools, and you will be trained by teachers who are experts on your own territory.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment for children that prepares and provides them with the skills they will need to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
It is not difficult to see that, in the current global business environment, languages are still vital for the future of a country, and education must also reflect this.
In fact, knowledge of modern languages should rather be treated as "International communication skills".
Independent schools offer choice, diversity and quality education to Scottish youth.
Il faut bien le faire – this is how it should be.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron's in San Diego with Lakers on Sunday
You don't have to wait long for fans who sit on their needles to see LeBron James take the first course in Los Angeles Lakers.
The Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play the preseason opening game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes you'll be on the track is still in question.
“More than one and less than 48,” wrote Walton on the Lakers official website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said that James would probably play for a limited amount of time.
After a few days of training, James was asked what his plans were for Lakers in the pre-six season.
"I don't have to play in the pre-season at this point in my career to be ready," he replied.
Trump's Western Virginia campaign and YouTube channel
Donald Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, is starting a long series of campaign events tonight.
This will be the first of five of Trump's scheduled events next week, including such stops as Tennessee and Mississippi in support of him.
Now that it has been delayed to fill the vacant seat of the Supreme Court, Trump is trying to gather supporters for the next mid-term elections, as there is a risk that the Republicans will lose power over Congress when the votes run in November.
When does Trump start tonight's event in West Virginia, and where can you follow it online?
Trump's speech to the Wheeling (Nyugat-Virginia) will begin at 7 a.m. on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
Trump's Western-virgin meeting can be followed online via YouTube's live transmission.
Trump will probably be touching his supreme court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh's hearing this week, which has been particularly tense in the light of the sexual harassment charges, and the Senate's confirmatory vote has been suspended for up to one week until the FBI investigates.
However, the primary objective of the sudden increasing events is to help the situation of the Republicans before the elections in November.
Trump’s campaign advisor said that next week’s five events “are designed to activate voters and supporters, while the Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority currently owned by the Senate and the House of Representatives,” says Reuters.
“To know how to manage Congress in his hands, he is so critical of his political plans that the President will visit as many states as possible.
The event that was planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, “You can also bring supporters from the States of Ohio and Pennsylvania, and even enter the media reports in Pittsburgh,” says West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, the second time in the past month Trump will visit West Virginia, a state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate in West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who, according to the polls, is not in a favourable position.
“It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must intervene in person to be more involved in the surveys,” said Simon Haeder, a politicalologist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: the American team is fighting a full range of individuals on Sundays to keep the hope alive
After three one-sided attempts, the four-games Saturday afternoon needed the Ryder Cup.
Luck and the moment is a rather air-based sports concept, yet every player believes in it, most of all during competitions such as Ryder Cup.
So who's got the ball now?
“They had six points of lead, and they only have four benefits, so we can say that we have the ball,” said Jordan Spieth, as he walked away at the end of the day.
Of course, four points still lead Europe, and 12 more can be obtained.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they finally got a small backsaw, and can draw encouragement from many things, including Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and they both scored three points out of four.
Spieth proved to be infallible from the start to the hole, and his performance was exemplary.
He and Thomas were in a double disadvantage after two in a row, with a critical roll in the fourth match.
The final round of the game resulted in a joyful cry like the 15th hole, a kind that can convince the viewer that everything is not lost to the American team.
“You only have to dig deep in yourself and care only for your own game,” Spieth said.
That's exactly what's still waiting for players.
Eighteen holes for a chance to leave a trail for yourself.
In the last two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the most popular partner in the Ryder Cup, could score more points than Spieth and Thomas.
Europe's odd but adorable pair has brought four out of four, and it seems they can't make mistakes.
“Moliwood” was the only pair who did not perform above the par on Saturday afternoon, and Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning at the last nine stages of the morning.
Thanks to this series, and the dynamics between the two of them and the audience that supported them, they became the highest on Sunday, and they do not expect anyone more than the sun to secure Europe's victory on Le Golf National's track than Fleetwood or Molinari.
The best thing would be to win one at a time, with different holes.
However, it would be early for Europeans to celebrate their victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon executed Sergio García, the fourth hero of the morning when he and Alex Noren played together.
Once, with one and twice the two blows over the coast, the Spanish and Swedish hit them in the first nine holes, which led them to a wave valley where they had no chance to climb out.
But on Sunday, there'll be no one to help you out of your hole.
The four-ball games and the four-game games are very entertaining from close to sight thanks to the interaction of couples. You can watch who gives advice, what you don't give, and how the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has been a better team than it has been, and it has a significant advantage for the last day, but this section 4 has shown that the American team has the necessary careers to fight, in spite of the fact that many of them have been missing, mainly from the American side.
Europe is starting the last day of Ryder Cup with a 10-6 advantage.
Europe can start the last day of Ryder Cup with a good start after the four-ball and four-ball matches on Saturday with 10-6 results against the United States.
The dynamic Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the fight against the sicking Tiger Woods, raising the difference to four points on Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, which is trying to recover the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the constantly flawing American team during the morning four-ball matches, winning the series to 3-1.
America showed greater resistance in fours, bringing in two games, but they still couldn't break the difference.
Jim Furyk's team would have to score eight points from the 12 single games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in the series, while he and Molinari – who only call them Molliwood after a sensational weekend – are the second pair of Ryder's history, which scored four points in four opening games.
After the Woods-Patrick Reed pair was beaten in the four ball, the unmotivated Woods and the U.S. newcomer, Bryson Dechambeau, were defeated for a decisive 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturdays, sometimes he's still tamed his talent, but out of 29 he's lost 19 of the four ballers and fours, seven of them in the string.
Justin Rose, who rested during the four-balls of the morning, returned to Henrik Stenson, and in the four-years he was defeated by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the first and third-placer of the world championship.
However, Europe did not succeed in this pleasant, windy day, southwest of Paris.
The three-time title protector Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the Americans how to do it on Saturday.
A bitter 2&1 victory was held against the Spanish pair Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls, and later on they returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIllroy in 4+3 ratios after losing the first two holes.
In the history of Ryder Cup, a team managed to return from the four-point disadvantage in individual competitions only twice, although a tie for Fury's title defense team is enough to keep the trophy.
However, after two days only being the second best, a Sunday counterattack seems to be quite unreal.
"No way" for North Korea to be unilateral if you don't trust your negotiating partner
The Foreign Minister of North Korea said to the UN on Saturday that the maintenance of sanctions only increased the mistrust of the United States of America and there is no way that, under such circumstances, the country would unilaterally surrender its nuclear weapons.
Ri Jongho said at the annual General Assembly of the World Organisation that North Korea has taken "serious and generous steps" over the last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile experiments, closing the site of nuclear experiments and promising not to expand its nuclear arsenal and nuclear technology applications.
“Unfortunately, however, we do not see similar responses from the Americans,” he said.
– In the absence of confidence in America, we feel that the security of our nation is not guaranteed, and in such circumstances it is impossible that we should be unilaterally and first deported."
While Ri reiterated North Korea's disappointment about Washington's opposition to the idea of "scrupulous" nuclear decommissioning, which, in the scenario, would be rewarded by North Korea for the steps taken until now, its statement did seem significant because it did not clearly reject unilateral nuclear decommissioning, as Phenjan did so far.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Dsongun and Donald Trump at the first summit ever between a powerful American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, and in which Kim promised to work on "the nuclear decommissioning of the Korean peninsula", while Trump guaranteed the integrity of North Korea.
North Korea seeks to formally score at the end of the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States considers that Phenjan should give up his nuclear weapons first.
Washington didn't allow any of the strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“America insists that we start with nuclear decommissioning and sanctions to force us to do what he wants, and also protests against the declaration of the end of the war,” said Ri.
– The idea of being forced to kneel with sanctions is the desire of those who do not know us.
The problem is that non-relief sanctions only increase our suspicions."
Ri did not mention that there would be a second summit between Kim and Trump, which, however, was specifically discussed by the American President in the UN at the beginning of the week.
Rather, the Minister pointed out that three meetings had been held between Kim and the South Korean President, Mun Djein, in the last five months, and added: "If the country involved in nuclear decommissioning were South Korea, not the United States of America, then the nuclear decommissioning of the Korean peninsula would not have been in such a position."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramaticly different from last year's, when he announced at the UN General Assembly that the North American continent's aim with North Korean missiles is inevitable, after Trump, the "evil President", Kimet, who is on a suicide mission.
This year, in the United Nations Trump, who threatened North Korea with "total destruction" last year, expressed its appreciation for Kim's courage to take steps towards decommissioning, but also noted that there is still much work to be done and that sanctions remain until North Korea carries out nuclear decommissioning.
On Wednesday Trump said that there was no time limit, that is, “if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council could reward Phenjan for the steps taken so far.
On the other hand, the American Foreign Minister, Mike Pompeo, said in the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The sanctions imposed by the Security Council must be observed uninterruptedly until we have reached the actual, final, verifiable nuclear decommissioning."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously maintained sanctions against North Korea in order to reduce the funding of Phenjan's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ríve at the break of the UN General Assembly and then said he was going back to Phenjan the next month to prepare the second summit.
Pompeo's been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip failed.
After leaving Phenjan in July, he announced that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him hours later of producing "gengster claims".
In the course of the meeting with Mun this month, North Korea promised to take down a missile base and a nuclear facility if the United States would also "take the right steps".
According to Mun, the ‘good steps’ Kim mentioned would be security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and that could lead to the normalisation of the relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are trained to get enough rest
Harvard University has a new subject this year for students to get more and more sleep, fighting against the growing macho culture of all night-long studies heated by caffeine.
An academic came to the conclusion that students from the world’s number one university are often completely lost when it comes to how they should care about themselves.
The course, which, according to him, was the first such training in the United States, was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler, who taught sleeping medicine at Harvard Medical College, and trained as a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
It encouraged the development of the course to give a lecture earlier on the impact of falling asleep on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and asked me, ‘Why am I facing this as a graduate now?’
He said that no one ever told him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me," he told Telegraph.
During the course launched this year for the first time, students will be informed of the fundamental impact of appropriate sleep habits on their learning and sports performance, in addition to the positive impact on their general public.
According to Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard College of Medicine and Director of the University’s Health Service, the university decided to start the course because the students were found to be extremely sleepy during the week.
The one-hour course also includes a series of interactive tasks.
For example, one shows a picture of a college room where students can click on coffee dishes, curtains, gym shoes and books to get to know the effects of caffeine and light, by how sports performance is affected by sleeplessness, and by the importance of the bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep withdrawal increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
They present the map of the university area with interactive icons to invite participants to reflect on the daily routine.
“We know that we will not change students’ behaviour immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to such knowledge, as they have the right to be aware of the health effects of smoking," said Professor Czeisler.
Culture continues to flourish, in which it is considered a performance to study for one night, said, adding that modern technology and constant pressure on students result in increasing problems of sleeplessness.
Adequate and high-quality sleep is the secret weapon of students in the fight against stress, fatigue and anxiety, and even against obesity, as sleep loss forces the brain into a hunger-eating way and causes a constant hunger.
Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler build the course, a 19-year-old student from California who studied chemistry and biophysics, and last year he took one of the professor's courses as the first professor at Harvard.
He said that those who heard him open his eyes and that he was encouraged to play sword alongside the launch of a university-level training.
It hopes that next step will enable postgraduate students to participate in a similar training programme before entering the competition.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set up a warning for bed, a wake-up alarm, and learn about the harmful effects of "blue light" from electrical screens and LED light sources, which can easily stifle them from their daily rhythms and make it difficult for them to sleep.
Livingston – Rangers 1-0: Menga beats Gerrard's men and scores
The Rangers suffered another alien defeat when Dolly Menga's bomb hit Steven Gerrard's team in a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The ibroxis have tried to win their first alien victory after the 4-1 victory in February, St. Johnstone, but Gerrard's second victory has been defeated by the 18 games led by Gary Holt as the manager. So they lose eight points from Ladbrokes Premiership (the Scottish championship)'s first-place player, Hearts.
Menga hit me seven minutes before midday, and his unmotivated Rangers team hasn't even had access to the equation.
While the Rangers slipped into the sixth place, Livingston climbed to the third, simply because of the goal difference, missed by the Hibernian.
In addition, Rangers may face further difficulties after the head injury caused by the coaster Calum Spence to seek medical care due to an object likely to be dropped from the guest’s sight.
Gerrard changed eight points on the team that got into the front end of the Betfred Cup with the fall of the Ayr.
Holt was on the field with the same 11 people in Livingston who took a point from the Hearts last week and would certainly have been happy to watch her perfected team suffocate her opponent's game wherever she could.
Although the Rangers led a ball possession, Livingston took more with what he got.
They could have scored for the first two minutes, when Scott Pittman started at Allan McGregor's gate with Menga's first injection, but the midfielder couldn't sell the key.
Keaghan Jacobs landed at captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, only hit the gate.
The Rangers took control, but there was more hope in their game in the last third than confidence.
Alfredo Morelos clearly felt that he deserved to be punished at the 15th minute when he collided with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson ran away his Colombian complaints.
The Rangers were only able to point a shot at the first two half-time gates, but the former ibroxi goalie Liam Kelly, the head of Lasana Coulibaly and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livi's attempt at the 34th minute faced the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved the chance, even for their hard work.
The Rangers once again missed a key that Jacobs forced.
Scott Arfield didn't respond in time when Declan Gallagher entered the ball for Scott Robinson, who found Menga well for easy completion.
Gerrard decided during the break, Coulibalyt was replaced by Ryan Kent, and this almost immediately explained the impact of the game when the extreme Morelost jumped, but the impressive form of Kelly blocked in time.
Livingston continued to reach the point of playing exactly what was right for him, and Lithgow and Halkett swept up the long balls together.
Holt's team could have had a bigger advantage over the last few minutes, but McGregor took the net well and hit Jacobs' position before Lithgow was next to an angle.
As the Rangers' exchange, Glenn Middleton tried to fight another eleven when he got caught up with Jacobs, but Thomson couldn't be convinced.
Almanach: Inventor of Geiger
One detail of our “Sunday morning” appleach: September 30, 1882, right now exactly 136 years ago... the day when the later physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, a invention that may have resulted in a device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has since become one of the basics of science and has become a part of pop culture thanks to the 1950s, strange cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evanst:
Man: "What is this miracle?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter.
If you put this headphone on, you can hear the sound of atoms released because of the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: "Listen to me, he's a bit of a patsy."
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, he continues to live in his invention.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see” abnormal cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see” and destroy abnormal cells
A vaccine given as part of a treatment teaches the immune system to recognise abnormal cells.
It is part of the method that immune cells should be obtained from the patient and then modified in a laboratory.
Thus they can “see” a protein that is accompanied by a variety of cancers. Immunocytes treated are injected back into the patient.
An experimental vaccine has achieved promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who has been treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect abnormal cells may have given her ovarian cancer goodbye for more than 18 months.
The method is used to extract immune cells from the patient; they are modified in the laboratory to “see” a protein called HER2 that is often accompanied by multiple cancers; then replanting the cells.
Jay Berzofsky, professor of the American National Cancer Research Institute (Bethesda, Maryland), said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine in our possession.”
HER2 "encouraging multiple cancers", including breast, ovary, lung and rectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method based on the highlighting of immune cells and “teaching” them on how to attack cancer cells has already been used successfully in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
The role of Kanye West SNL, who wears the MAGA cap, has been highlighted in a tyrant who supports Trump.
It didn't go too well.
Kanye West has been whistled in the Saturday Night Live studio after an incoherent manifestation of American President Donald Trump, and has announced that he will be running for president in 2020.
After giving the third song of the evening, Ghost Town, in the cap of Make America Great Again, he began to speak against the Democrats and again stressed that Trump was in support of Trump.
“Manytimes when I talk to someone who is white, he asks the question, ‘How can you like Trump, because he is racist?’
If you were interested in racism, I would have moved away from America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program was opened by Matt Damon with a parody in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee about Christine Blasey's sexual harassment charges.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the video about West's speech was uploaded to social media by Chris Rock's humorist.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of West with the charge.
West even complained to the audience that he was being picked up behind the scenes because of his hat.
"I was startled behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out in that hat."
I was scared!
And they said I was in the sunk place," said the Washington Anaminer.
West continued: “You want to see a sunken place? I'm picking up my Superman robe, because that means they can't tell me what to do.
Try to love."
His manifestations were accompanied by a whistle from the audience at least twice, and SNL’s actors apparently felt embarrassed according to one of the witnesses who said to Variety: “The whole studio was silenced in silence.”
Instead of a singer from Westet Ariana Grande, she was invited at the last minute, whose former friend, Mac Miller, died a few days before.
The West raised several questions when she performed the song I Love it dressed as Perrier glass.
Westet, head of the conservative TPUSA Group, was assured by Candace Turner in a Tweet: “One of the bravest spirits: WELCOMES, HOW YOU HAVE BEEN INVESTED WITH THE NETHERLAND.”
Karen Hunter, the host of a talk show, said that West was simply "self, and that's great".
“But I decided not to reward anyone (with the purchase of music or fashion articles or with the support of “art”) whom I believe to be an ideology that is harmful to the community to which I belong.
He's free.
But we did, too," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, now he's "the creature known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he's in the lead of Diddy, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P. Diddy.
His partner, Snoop Dog, also took the name Snoop Lion, and, of course, the late legend, Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to an artist known as Prince.
They're charging the Belfast restaurant delay with attempted murder.
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted manslaughter after a man was cut in a restaurant in the eastern part of Belfast on Friday.
According to the police's statement, the case happened in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant must stand before the Belfast City Court on Monday.
The prosecutions are being reviewed by the D.A.'s office.
Kit Harington, the Star of the Thrones, finds excessive masculinity harmful.
Kit Harington is most known as Jon Snow in the Battle of Thrones, and in HBO's violent fantasy series, he often takes a sword himself.
The 31-year-old actor, however, spoke against the stereotyped macho heroes, stressing that, when such heroes see, young boys often feel that hard action is needed to combat respect.
In his statement to The Sunday Times Culture, he said that something had gone wrong and asked how the problem of the adverse effects of excessive masculinity could be addressed in the #MeToo era.
The star who recently married his 31-year-old serial colleague Rose Leslie said that it was very important to remedy the problem.
“I personally am deeply affected by this matter, how did the representation of manhood become so distorted? ” the actor asked.
– What have we taught men when they were children about the problem we are facing?"
Kit claims that television is also responsible for the spread of the distorted image of masculine, since the programs often contain very masculin characters.
He added: “What is it that is born with us, and what is it that we learn?
What does the street and TV say to young boys, which makes them feel like they can only be men in this way?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time – and how we can change that.
'Cause it's obvious something's wrong with young men."
Who said in the interview that after the summer season of the series will not be included in Tronok's history series or sequences, because "he is sick of battles and horses".
From November, Kit Sam Shepard True West will play a major role in the reprocessing of his film, "The West", which is about a producer and his life-giving brother.
The actor told me that the best thing he got from the Troon battle was his wife, Rose, who he met during the production of the series.
“I met my wife on the set, so I could thank my future family and my life before me for the series,” said Kit.
Rose Ygritte, who was in love with Kit's character Jon Snow in the Emmy Prize-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's Scottish family estate.
HIV/AIDS: New patients increased by 14% in China
China reported an increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS by 14%.
According to health officials, this means more than 820 000 people involved.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, the number of cases reported increased by around 40,000.
Compared to the previous one, a significant majority of newly infected people are sexually transmitted to the disease.
The disease previously spread rapidly through infected blood in parts of China.
However, at a conference in Jünnan Province, health officials have stated that the number of such cases has since fallen to almost zero.
Nevertheless, compared to the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100 000.
The transmission of HIV by sexual means poses a serious problem for the Chinese LMBT community.
Homosexuality has not been a criminal offence in China since 1997, but discrimination against the community has been very strong ever since.
Based on estimates from various studies, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with other men are eventually married to women due to the conservative country's population.
The disease spreads in these relationships in many cases due to inappropriate sexual protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has been providing universal access to anti-HIV medicines as part of the problem-solving programme.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of his staff would leak the data of Republican Senators and condemns "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
American Congressman Maxine Waters rejected charges on Saturday that a member of his staff published the personal data of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia side of the senators.
According to the Democrat representative of Los Angeles, these claims were distributed by experts and websites on the "broader" side.
“Warring, lying and more mean lies,” wrote Waters on Twitter.
The information was reported to include the address and telephone number of Senator Lindsey Graham and Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch in Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday. The publicist's identity is unknown, but it is certain that they were published from the Capitol Hill during the Senate hearing of Brett Kavanaugh's supreme court candidate for sexual harassment.
The leak took place shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative pages, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, can be linked to the Waters office of an IP address identified as a source, and data from a member of Waters' staff has also been reported, says The Hill.
“These charges are completely unfounded, false, and obviously liars,” Waters continued.
– My staff is not responsible for leaking information. However, their right to anonymity, protection of personal data and security is damaged due to fraud and false accusations.
These charges are completely unfounded, false, and obviously lying."
Waters' statements on the Internet were quickly followed by criticism, amongst the critics was Ari Fleischer, former press secretary of the White House.
“This is an angry denial,” wrote Fleischer.
– On this basis, it appears that Waters does not have the blood temperature necessary for the representative post.
If someone is suspected of something he didn't commit, he can't react angryly.
You can't be rude.
You can't question the defendant's motives.
He must remain calm and calm."
Waters' reaction was compared to Fleischer's reaction to the democratic party criticisms of Judge Kavanaugh, who, according to some critics, seemed too angry at the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, who is a Republican candidate for the position of Mr Waters in the mid-term elections, also shared his opinion on Twitter.
“If it is true, it is serious,” he wrote in his message.
In his communication, Waters stated that his office had informed the “compliant authorities and law enforcement authorities” in the case of false accusations.
"We hope that the offender's identity will be found out," added Waters, and that they will be legally held accountable for any act that endangers or harms any member of my crew."
Johnny English again, or Rowan Atkinson's paralyzing spy game
Today, we are looking for references to Brexit in all British-related films, and there is no exception to this, neither is the French, classed under Johnny English, whose first part, Johnny English, in 2003, nor the second part, Johnny English, recharged in 2011, to the cinema.
Will sarcastic, self-parodilating satyres become the new export product of the British nation, in which we live our own obvious paranoia?
As far as I'm concerned, Johnny English, who is an incompetent, rubber-faced, incompetent, had enough work to make another return – it is clear from his name that this comedian character has been created so that the crowds of the non-English-speaking countries of the world can laugh at him.
Johnny English, of course, is a smug secret agent who thinks he's a bit of a winner, so reminds Inspector Clouseau, sometimes Mr. Bean, and occasionally the guy who, by pressing a single key, contributed to the performance of the Fire Rangers' headline at the 2012 opening ceremony of the London Olympics.
The character is originally based on the mysterious international traveler Atkinson once played in a long-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial and left behind chaos everywhere.
There's a good moment or two in the last Johnny English movie.
I loved how Johnny, dressed in medieval armor, approached a helicopter, and then reached the robots on his helmet for a few moments.
Atkinson's comedy vein is well established in the film, but the humor of the film doesn't really work, and it does seem superfluous, since today, "serious" fries like James Bond movies or Mission Impossible series are also bravely reaching the instrument of humor.
To feel that the humor of the film is more aimed at children, and to me Johnny's English-sluggish, failed adventures do not reach the level of ingenuity and genius that Atkinson brings in the silent scenes of the Mr. Bean series.
The starting point of the film is eternal: Great Britain is in grave danger.
A cyber offender broke into the British spy network's top secret online network and revealed the identity of all the British agents to the biggest horror of the on-call agent Kevin Eldon, who, unfortunately, was only given such a small role in the film.
This could be the last angle to the casket of the arrogant and sharing prime minister, whose political popularity is in ruins anyway: Emma Thompson practically plays Theresa May, and she brings everything out of the character she wrote anyway.
His intelligence advisors are describing to him that since all active agents have been found out, he's got to get a calmed agent on the job.
This rested agent, of course, is the two-legged Johnny English, who has been working as a teacher in an excellent school since his retirement, but unlike the subject, he teaches children spying – there are, of course, funny scenes here, while he presents the basics of spying to such an English style as "Rocksuli".
The English will be delivered quickly to Whitehall, where he will meet again at the emergency briefing with his former, suffering gun carrier Bough, who is now being formed by Ben Miller.
Bough has since been married, and has also married a captain of a submarine, who has always had an ear to his mouth – the captain is directed by Vicki Pepperdine, who is dedicated to a much better role.
So his two-faced "Batman and Robin" pair of His Majesty's National Security Service will return to action and face Ophelia Bulletova, who will be formed by the beautiful Olga Kurylenko as a woman of true destiny.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is increasingly being accessed by a charismatic IT billionaire who claims to be able to solve the digital problems of Great Britain: his name is Jason Volta, and Jake Lacy plays it.
English and Bough start their clown mission: they turn on a fancy French restaurant masking a waiter, and then they smuggle themselves into Volta's luxury yacht in the middle of an amazing turn, and English actually frees hell when he tries to get to know Volta's apartment with a VR-headset.
These stations are needed to get to the end of the story, but whatever fun and turnips it's done, it might make a little too much of a child's film impression.
The outcome is quite mediocre.
As with the other Johnny English films, I now have the question: can't the British film industry finally give Rowan Atkinson a talented role?
The British Labour Party denies the introduction of a four-day working week while paying the British for a five-day job.
Jeremy Corbyn's working party is working on a radical draft, introducing a four-day working week, with employees working for five-day pay.
The party is said to want workers to benefit from the artificial intelligence (MI) revolution so that business leaders can provide workers with an extra day off thanks to increased income.
According to the draft, workers would have a three-day weekend, while taking them home as much as they've done so far.
According to the sources, the idea should be "in" into the party's economic programme, which aims to balance the balance sheet on the workers' side of the country.
The four-day working week idea is supported by the Trade Union Congress, so that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A leading official of the Labour Party said to the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
Although it will not happen from day to day, the four-day working week is an idea that fits well into the party's programme that will use the balance sheet language for workers in the economy, and also fit into the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this kind of idea, and the Green Party has campaigned with the promise of a four-day working week in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, the idea does not enjoy the support of the Labour Party as a whole.
The Labour spokesperson said: "The four-day working week is not one of the policies supported by the Party, and the question is not even on the agenda."
Mr McDonnell, shadow finance minister, presented his vision of the socialist revolution affecting the economy at the Labour Conference last week.
McDonald said that he was determined to fight to regain power from "unscrupulous directors" and "beneficiaries" of relics.
If the plans of the shadow finance minister were to be implemented, the shareholders of the water service companies would not recover the full profits they deserve, since a Labour Government would make "deductions" as a penalty for the alleged harmful activities.
McDonald also confirmed that he planned to turn workers into a member of the board of directors and to create Inclusive Ownership Funds, which would transfer 10% of the shares of private companies to employees, which could thus obtain 500 important dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy explained in the 60 Minutes show whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their opinion.
As a result of the FBI investigation against Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the final vote on the election of the Supreme Judge of Kavanaugh will be held at least a week later than the original date.
In his interview "60 Minutes" on Sunday, journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed less committed than his South Carolina colleague.
“I mean, of course,” said Kennedy.
That's what I said before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the case broke out, and I asked him, "Did you?"
His answer was firm and clear."
But Graham's vote seems to be concrete.
“I have already decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and I would need extremely serious charges to change my mind,” said Graham.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know Brett was very much denying the claims,” added Graham, Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the persons named by Dr. Ford have been able to prove the charges.
It's a 36-year-old story.
I don't think anything new will come up."
What is a Global Civil Festival and have you managed to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, the annual music event in New York, the Global Civil Festival, will begin. At the festival, world stars will stand up for a truly noble goal: the global eradication of poverty.
The Global Citizens' Festival is now being held for the next seven years, it is expected that tens of thousands will be filled with the Great Pázsit of Central Park, where participants will not only enjoy the performance of Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but will also draw attention to the real purpose of the event: the eradication of deep poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival was first organised in 2012 as part of the Global Poverty Project. The project is run by an international interest enforcement group aimed at eradicating poverty by involving more and more people in the active fight against poverty.
You can get a free ticket to the concert (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) who undertake certain tasks or "actions", such as voluntary work, e-mailing a leading politician, a phone call, or any other material activity to draw attention to the purpose of the project: the eradication of poverty.
But how successful has the global citizen been in achieving the stated goals over the last 12 years?
Is it really an effective tool to reward people with concerts to convince others about the importance of action, or is it just another form of the so-called "clichtivism" when people feel that they have made a real contribution to a case by signing an online petition or writing an Twitter message?
Since 2011, global citizens have reported that more than 19 million "actions" have been carried out by project supporters, which have served a number of different objectives.
According to the organisation, these actions contributed to the separation of $37 billion by world leaders to anti-poverty policies and commitments that could affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group claimed that 390 commitments and announcements were due from their actions, 10 billion dollars were already paid out or collected during the fund collection.
The group estimates that the money collected had a direct impact on the lives of nearly 649 million people.
The main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership between investors and contractors based in the United Kingdom, which aims to help children "to achieve their potential".The organization promised Rwanda $35 million to help eradicate hunger after receiving more than 4700 Twitter messages from "global citizens".
"With the support of the UK Government and donors, national governments and similar global citizens, we can banish social injustice and malnutrition among the footnotes of history books," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition to the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also claims that after asking the United Kingdom to improve the food of mothers and their children in over 5,000 actions, the government has allocated resources to the Power of Nutrition project, which will improve the food of 5 million women and children.
Frequently published on the website of a global citizen is one of the following: "Why do you think that poverty can be eliminated?"
According to the response of the global citizen: “It will be a long and difficult journey, sometimes where we will be stuck and sometimes we will fail.
But like the previous movements of civil law and anti-segregation, we reach our goal, because we are stronger together."
Among other things, Janet Jackson, the Weekly, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae will attend this year's New York event, and the leaders will be Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Minister for Interior Affairs: US Navy "blocking" to prevent Russian energy exports
"If necessary", Washington would even introduce the Navy against the entry into the Russian energy market, so, for example, Russian energy could not reach the Middle East," said the US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke, Washington Anaminer.
Zinke claimed that Russia's active presence in Syria, especially in the Russian operations at the request of the legitimate Syrian Government, was simply an excuse to obtain new energy markets for itself.
"I think they are only there in the Middle East because they want to sell energy there, as they do in Eastern Europe and the south of Europe," Zinke said in a statement.
And according to the Home Secretary, there are ways to stop the Russians.
“The United States of America is able to ensure with its Navy that sea routes are open and can block them if necessary, so that Russian energy can not enter the markets,” said Zinke.
Zinke has spoken to participants in a non-profit group organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance – the non-profit group defines itself as “the voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
In his speech, he compared the action taken by Washington against Russia and Iran and noted that it was practically the same methods.
"Iran and Russia can be sanctioned economically in the same way: using existing energy sources and introducing new ones," Zinke said, while calling Russia a "one-dimensional economy", pointing to the country's dependence on fossil fuels.
The statements coincide with the Trump Government's plan to export liquefied natural gas to Europe, thereby excluding Russia from the market, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
Therefore, the leading officials of the Trump Government, including the President himself, persuades Germany to back off the "unfair" pipeline project called North Stream 2, which, if implemented, will make Moscow a "steal".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the existing capacity is doubled, thus increasing its capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, with a USD 11 billion North Stream 2 pipeline only of economic nature.
According to the Kremlin, Washington is so strongly opposed to the project for economic reasons, which is the manifestation of unfair competition.
"I assume that we have the same view that energy should not be used for the exercise of pressure and that consumers should be given the opportunity to choose their suppliers", said Alexander Novak, Russian Minister of Energy after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Minister of Energy, in Moscow, in September.
The American attempt to convince was reversed because Germany confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Industry Association (BDI), called on the US not to interfere with EU energy policy, as it did with the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I find it a problem when a third country interferes with our energy issues,” said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industrial Association (BDI), Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin after their last meeting.
Senator Elizabeth Warren Massuchusetts will "require for serious consideration" to launch for the presidency in 2020
Senator Elizabeth Warren Massuchusetts said on Saturday that after the mid-term elections, he would “seriously consider” to run for the presidency.
In Warren Massachusetts, at a town meeting in holyoke, he confirmed that he was considering the start.
“It is time for women to enter Washington and restore the poorly functioning government, and it is also time for a woman to become president,” said Warren, According to The Hill.
– After 6 November, I seriously consider going for the presidency."
At the city meeting, Warren was critical of Donald Trump, and he said that he thought he was going "in a bad direction".
"I have serious concerns about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," Warren said.
Warren literally criticised Trumpot and Brett Kavanaugh's supreme court candidate.
In a Friday's Twitter message, Warren wrote, "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, on the basis of a survey published on Thursday, the majority of the voters of Warren Massuchusetts do not think that Warren should start for the presidency in 2020 .
Based on the study by the Political Analyst Centre of Suffolk University and Boston Globe, 58% of the “good chance” masseusetts voters in Warren did not have to run for the presidency.
32% support Warren's presidential candidate.
According to the survey, the majority of those asked would support Deva Patrick's former presidential candidate, 38% would support him and 48% would oppose him.
Among other things, the names of high-level Democrat politicians such as former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders Vermont have emerged from the presidential election in 2020.
Based on the Associated Press report, Biden will decide whether to leave until January.
Sarah Palin Track Palin's PTSD meeting at Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Track Palin served in Iraq for a year after he applied in September
On Monday night, he was arrested on charges of domestic violence
“My son goes through what he has been going through since he got home, I understand the other families who experience the terrible consequences of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers are returning home,” said Sarah Palin, at the meeting of Tulsai in Donald Trump, Oklahoma, to the audience.
He called the arrest of Palin's son "the elephant in the room" and said that his son, like the other war veterans, was "changed, forced back, and he kept thinking about whether or not he had the proper respect for the service his fellows, the pilots, and all the other members of the army did for the country."
Track Palin was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence against women, and Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Wasilla police, said that, according to a report, Track Palin committed domestic violence with a gun.
18 Member States and Washington D.C. also support judicial review of asylum policy
18 Member States and Washington D.C. are also in favour of a judicial review of the new American asylum policy that prevents those fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 different Member States and Washington D.C. wrote an expert letter on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who attacks policy in court, says NBC News.
The full name of the applicant for Grace vs Sessions, initiated by the American Civil Liberties Union in August, was not published.
According to the applicant's woman, she was abused by her partner and "sons of violent crime", but on July 20, American officials refused asylum.
She's under arrest in Texas.
Prosecutors of the countries that supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guadeloupe as places from which many requests for asylum have been made to the United States, because violence committed by crime and within the family causes a constant problem in these countries.
The new American asylum policy has withdrawn the decision taken by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (BIA), which allowed the asylum application to be lodged in order to escape the domestic violence of non-documented immigrants.
Karl Racine, Washington, D.C., in a Friday’s communication, stated that the new policy “is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law.”
"In accordance with federal law, all asylum applications must be dealt with in accordance with the facts and circumstances in which they exist, and such an obstacle violates this principle", the expert letter states.
The prosecutors also stated in the letter that the policy against immigration harms the American economy, since immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "to fill the lowest level of employment."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions instructed the asylum judges not to grant asylum rights to victims of domestic violence and crimes.
"The right of asylum applies to those who leave their country for reasons of race, religion, national origin, belonging to a specific social group or political belief, or for reason of a well-founded fear of persecution," said Sessions on the announcement of the policy on 11 June.
The right of asylum has not been established to solve all the problems facing people worldwide, no matter how serious they are, day by day.
Desperate rescue in Palu, the number of deaths doubled, rescue formations compete with time
The situation of the survivors is becoming increasingly uncertain.
“Everybody is very tense,” says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while calming her febrile son in a disaster in the centre of an evacuation of Palu.
- The ambulances bring the bodies every minute.
We barely have drinking water."
Some of the residents returned to their homes to save them from the wet stuff that could still be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, which were also damaged by the 7.5-force earthquake, are not able to supply people.
Some of those injured, including Dwi Harist, with broken spine and shoulder, were moved to Palui Military Hospital. Patients were taken outside the hospital building due to the high-strength post-emergency attacks.
The man’s eyes were filled with tears when he remembered how the fifth - floor hotel room, in which his wife and daughter were occupied, was shaken into a devastating upheaval.
“There was no time to escape.
I think I was caught in the collapsed walls," Haris said to Associated Press, and then added that his family came to town because of a wedding.
– I heard my wife cry for help and then she was quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of embezzling the country with propaganda.
The Chinese Ambassador of the United States accused Beijing of spreading propaganda in the U.S. press. This took place a week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-sided ad in an American daily, which stressed the mutual benefits of American-China trade relations.
Last Wednesday, American President Donald Trump referred to the announcement in the China Daily Des Moines Register, Iowa's largest number of copies, while accusing China of trying to intervene in the US Congress elections on 6 November. China denies the charge.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to intervene in the US elections is that some US officials who say that Reuters are making a new stage in the increasingly powerful action against Washington China to put China under pressure.
Although it is not unusual for foreign governments to promote trade with their countries through advertising, there is a growing trade war between Beijing and Washington, which imposes new and new duties on each other's imported products.
According to American and Chinese experts, customs duties imposed by the Chinese at the beginning of the trade war as a response sought to target exporters of countries in which Trump and the Republican Party were popular, such as Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the Chinese Ambassador of the United States and former Iowa governor for several cycles, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses, because the Iowa State exported a significant amount of agricultural products to China.
Branstad wrote in his opinion in the Sunday’s Des Moines Register that “China is still waking up our country by the fact that it has published propaganda advertisements in our free press.”
“The Chinese Government is taking advantage of the highly respected American tradition of freedom of speech and press by spreading propaganda in paid ads in the Des Moines Register,” wrote Branstad.
– However, if we go to a Beijing newspaper store, we can hardly find critical-sound articles. The Chinese press does not faithfully reflect Chinese people's different views about the increasingly grim growth prospects of the Chinese economy, as the media is under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party."
Branstad added that “One of the most famous newspapers in China refused to bring it” but he did not mention it.
According to analysts, the Republicans can alienate female voters before the mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh scandal.
According to analysts, many high-ranking Republican politicians take the highest court candidate Brett Kavanaugh in the crossfire of sexual harassment charges, in particular, to lose the support of female voters before the mid-term elections.
The case caused intense emotions, and most Republicans publicly declared that they would continue to vote for Kavanaugh.
These statements cannot be reversed, says Grant Reeher, a politician at the Maxwell School Institute at the University of Siracúz, in a Saturday article in The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts about the fact that the last-minute FBI investigation that Jeff Flake Republican Senator in Arizona had proposed will be sufficient to calm down angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – neither tomorrow nor November –” said Karine Jean-Pierre, head adviser and national spokesperson of the Progressive Group MoveOn, according to a Washington, D.C., on Friday.
According to Mic's report, on Friday morning, in the Senate corridor, some protestors were scandaling, "It's coming in November!" because, despite Dr. Christine Blasey's statement, the Republican Justice Committee decided not to withdraw Kavanaugh's nomination.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be amazing", said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
“Many people say he's already been very tall, and that's true.
But it may be even higher, especially among the suburban insecure female voters and young people (18-29 years) who, although not eager for the President, do not often vote."
Analysts have already assumed before Ford made his public statement that he could strike back the Republicans if they continued to stand up for Brett Kavanaugh. Since then, Ford described in detail why he accused the Supreme Court candidate of sexual harassment.
“The Republican Party was wrong about organic soil” said the former president of the Republican National Commission, according to NBC News, Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Commission.
"This is not only about the Commission's vote and the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be named, but also about how the Republicans handled the case and how they acted with Ford", highlighted Guy Cecil, the US Director of the Priorities for Democrat Elections.
However, it seems that the Americans have shared quite a bit in whether they think Ford or Kavanaugh's testimony is true.
Based on the new YouGov survey, 41% of respondents believed or believed Ford's testimony, while 35% of respondents gave Kavanaugh the same answer.
In addition, 38% of respondents say Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied in his statement, while only 30% of Ford believed that.
As a result of Flake's motion, the FBI is currently investigating the authenticity of Ford's claims, as is the case with another accuser of Kavanaugh, Deborah Ramirez, on the Guardian.
A week ago, Ford swore to the Senate Justice Committee that at 17 years of age, Kavanaugh was intoxicating him.
Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his sex organ at a party in the 1980s when they both studied at Yale.
The inventor of the world web would launch a new internet to confront Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technological legend, Inrupt, is an open-source platform of Berners-Lee, based on Solid.
With Solid, users can choose where to store their data and who can access each information.
In his exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee was joking that the intention behind Inrupt was to “take control over the world”.
“We have to do it now,” he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application of Solid technology allows people to create their own "personal online repository", also known as POD.
This may include lists, job lists, calendars, music libraries, as well as other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available from the same browser at the same time.
In the personal online repository, it is unique that the user can choose fully who can access your data.
The company calls it "the exercise of the right to self-determination of personal data".
According to John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, it is the responsibility of the company to ensure resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contracting developers who are involved in the project, and a community of voluntary programmers.
From this week onwards, world technology developers will be able to create their own decentralised applications using Inrupt-site devices.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not ask "Facebook and Google whether to introduce the full-change technology that would put business models of companies at the top of their heads from day to day."
"We don't ask permission from them."
According to Berners-Lee, published on the Media Saturday, Inrupt’s “delivery of commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the newly built network for Solid."
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Technical University.
Berners-Lee has participated in discussions on Internet neutrality in recent months as an important body of opinion.
Despite launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I am infinitely optimistic about the next era of the World Network,” said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann Viktória was celebrated during World War I
The only Viktória cross was celebrated by an English minister's hometown for 100 years after he performed his heroic act in World War I.
Honorable and lieutenant-in-chief Bernard Vann earned the honor during the attacks on 29 September 1918 in Vienna and Leacourt.
Four days later, however, a sniper killed him, so he could never know that he deserved the highest medal of the British armed forces.
Two grandkids of the monument were exposed to the celebration of the Northamptonshire County in Rushden on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was “symbolical” that the Memorial stone was handed over exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s act of honor.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Bernard Vann, honorable and Lieutenant Colonel, led his flagship “in the middle of a dense fog or a heavy gunfire and machine gunfire” through the Canal de Saint-Quentin Canal.
Later, he rushed into the faceline and stood at the head of the flagship with “exceptional heroism,” followed by a camp cannon division, disposing of three of its members.
On October 4, 1918, honorable Bernard Vann and Lieutenant Colonel, a German sniper was shot — just one month before the end of the war.
“I know I can never reach what my grandfather did, and this taught me humility,” said Michael Vann, 72 years old.
After the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band band, Michael Vann and his brother, Dr. James Van, were crowned with the Memorial Stone.
Michael Vann said it was an honor to have played a part in the celebration and added: “The strength of a true hero is demonstrated by how many people express their respect later.”
The MMA fans were up all night watching the Bellator 206 broadcast, instead of having Peppa pig.
Imagine he's been up all night looking at the exciting Bellator 206, and the transmission's gone.
The San José show had 13 battles, six of which were broadcast live in the UK on Channel 5 channels as part of the main competition program.
At 6 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to fight each other, the British viewers were not surprised at the game instead of having Peppa a pig on the show.
This has been difficult for many who have stayed up until morning hours due to this particular collision.
Instead of the MMA game, one of the fans labeled children's cartoons as "a kind of sick joke" on Twitter.
“At 6 o’clock in the morning, the channel is no longer allowed to broadcast such content, and they therefore had to switch to children’s programmes,” said Dave Schwartz, Head Vice President of Bellator’s Communications and Marketing Department.
- Yeah, that's Peppa, the pig's time."
Scott Coker, President of Bellator, promised that in the future, the schedule of the show would be revised so that the United Kingdom viewers would be taken into account.
"I think we can solve this by repeating it," Coker said.
– However, since it is 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, it is our time Sunday, which they already have on Monday, we cannot remedy the situation.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the show turned on, a lot of messages arrived, and most of them weren't very friendly.
At first we thought we were dealing with a technical problem, so we tried to fix the mistake.
But that's not what we're talking about. We're dealing with a legal problem.
However, I can promise you that this will not happen the next time.
Instead of the previous six, there will only be five matches in the program – we very much wanted to please the viewers, but we accounted for ourselves.
It was an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley's minority complex due to his sexual orientation
Tom Daley, a jumper at the Olympics, said that at a young age, he felt inferior to everyone, because of his sexual orientation, but he drew the motivation to succeed.
According to the 24-year-old athlete, he didn't notice "not everyone like him" until high school.
In his radio show Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, Lauren Laverne told the broadcaster that he stood up for gay rights to give hope to others.
He added that since he was a parent, he was much less interested in the Olympics.
For many years, Kirsty Young, the permanent director of the show, missed several months because of his illness.
In Laverne's first show, Daley invited him as a “shipbreaker” said that when he was young, he felt less than anyone else, because “socially it was not accepted if someone loved boys and girls too.”
He said: “To this day, the feeling of inferiority and differentness is what I draw strength and strength from to achieve my success.”
He wanted to prove that he too was worth something so that he wouldn't disappoint everyone when it came to his sexual orientation.
The double Olympic Bronze Jumper has become a well-known representative of the LMBT community and has asked the world governments to decriminate homosexuality in as many countries as possible by taking advantage of this year's national community games in Australia.
He said that he spoke because he felt lucky that he could live his life openly, without negative consequences, and that he wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that he was “surprisingly surprised” when he fell in love with another man, Dustin Lance Black, American filmmaker, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley and his Academy Prize-winning screenwriter, 20 years old, were married last year, and he claims that the difference in age has never been a problem among them.
“If you go through so much at a young age,” he said, “at the age of 14, you were at the first Olympics, and your father died of cancer three years later, you will find it hard in your own age to find someone who has similarly experienced extreme experiences.
In June, he adopted a little boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley.
“If you asked me this question last year, I would have said the most important thing is to win a gold medal,” he said.
There are more important things than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal Robbie."
The child's name became Robert after Daley's father, who died in 2011, after having been diagnosed with brain tumours.
Daley said that his father refused to accept that he was going to die, and one of the last questions was whether the tickets were already available for the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the first row.
“I was unable to answer him, ‘Daddy, you will not be there in the first row’, he quoted.
“I held his hand when his breathing stopped, but until that moment I could not accept that my father was not vulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the Bronze Prize.
“I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of the home audience at the Olympic Games,” he said.
The number of Heather Small Proud (Püske) helped him greatly during the Olympic preparation, and to this day he will be goose-skiny when he hears it.
Desert Island Discs starts at 11:15 a.m. on Sunday, local time on BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson wasn't in shape, and he was on the Ryder Cup Saturday night.
The U.S. Phil Mickelson can set a record by participating in the 47th cup game on the Ryder Cup on Sunday, but you need to win your form back if you don't want this milestone to remain an unpleasant experience in your memory.
For Mickelson's record, 12 times at the two-year event, however, Jim Furyk's team captain was sent to the bench because of his performance at the four-ball and four-ball games Saturday.
Instead of being at the heart of events as often as when the United States had to fight for a win in the big tournaments, the team is cheering in one half of the day, practising the other half of the game and trying to correct the flaws that weaken its game.
At the top of his career, he was never one of the most accurate bats, so the 48-year-old player does not really have the narrow track of Le Golf National, where the high grass cost a very high price to pay for faults.
And if the race itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson will be facing the exact Francesco Molinari English champion in Sunday's ninth match, who won all four games this week in the starting Tommy Fleetwood team.
If Americans start with a four-point stake before the 12-person match start hard, then Mickelson's game can be crucial.
Furyk claims he trusts the player, but what else can he say?
“He is fully aware of the role he played in today’s development. He beat my back, held my arm, and promised that he would be ready for tomorrow,” said Furyk.
- Very confident.
He's one of the biggest, and he's done a lot for the team in the past and over the past week.
Basically, I didn't mean two games for him.
I was planning more, but in the circumstances, we decided that this was the best solution.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else."
With Mickelson's Sunday role, he's gonna break Nick Faldo's record, and no one's ever played more games on the Ryder Cup.
This allows you to close a series on the Ryder Cup that is far below the player's individual performance.
Mickelson can win 18 wins, 20 wins and seven drawbacks, but Furyk stressed that the presence of the veteran player does not bring tangible benefits to the team.
“Voicey, sarcastic, witty, likes to joke with others, great team members,” he explained.
– I think the younger players also enjoyed the games against him, and it is good to see that.
His presence goes beyond a strict game."
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, is aware that they can easily lose their gain
Thomas Bjørn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that even if someone has a significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup holding individual games, luck can easily turn their backs on him.
The Danish player was first introduced in a 1997 Valderrama match, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros gained a five-point advantage against the Americans, and then they just managed to keep a hairline for the 141⁄2-131⁄2 win.
“We must always remind ourselves that we have won a great advantage in Valderrama, yet we have won only one piece of hair, and we also had a great advantage in Brookline, where we finally got out,” said Bjørn, in the picture after the 5-3th of Friday and yesterday’s victory of the 2018 class, leading to 10-6 at Le Golf National.
– It is enough to think about the competitions of previous years, and everyone can already see that the game is not over yet.
You have to play full power tomorrow.
So come on and do whatever it takes to win.
We can't relax until the points are on the board.
We have a goal that is nothing more than to win this trophy, and that's all we have to focus on right now.
As I said earlier, I am most concerned with our team's 12 players, but we must also pay attention to the other side, who happen to be one of the biggest players in the world."
proud of the team’s performance in the difficult course, Bjørn added: “I would never make predictions in such a situation.
Tomorrow's a whole different pasta.
Then everything depends on individual performances, which is completely different from team game.
It's great to play in pairs when things go well, but when you stand out individually, you'll find out in every way what kind of golfer really is.
That's what we need to explain to the players that tomorrow they'll bring the best out of the field.
They're gonna have to break up with their partner, who's gonna have to make the best of it."
Unlike Bjørn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the opponent's team explicitly trusts that his players will be better off alone than in pairs, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Furyk personally has already experienced both sides of the last-day resurrections: in Brookline, he was a member of the winning team, and then he was on the losing side of the European team after his mentioned bravorous performance as “the Medinah miracle”.
“I remember every damn word,” he replied when he was asked, because he encouraged the players before the last day, team captain Ben Crenshaw, in 1999.
– We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we have a quick start as best we can see in Brookline as we can see in Medinah.
If one of the teams really jumps in, it puts the opponent's players under huge pressure during the mid-games.
We set the order accordingly and prepared our players so that they can perform a true miracle tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of taking the lead in trying to reverse the job and of playing against Rory McIlroy in the first game, followed by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the first half of the European team.
"I have also decided in favour of the order, because I believe that this is the way the picture matches from the beginning to the end," Bjørn added.
The transfer of Germany's latest warship has again been postponed
The German Navy's latest Freret should have been put in service in 2014 to replace the ageing Cold War war warships, but due to various system failures and exponentially increasing costs, this is still waiting for you for at least the next year.
The launch of "Rheinland-Pfalz" was postponed to the first half of 2019 by the flagship of the brand new Baden-Württemberg, and wrote the Die Zeit weekly, quote one of the military spokespersons.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy's bond in 2014, but the continued delays made the fate of the large-scale project very difficult.
In 2007, the Navy ordered four Baden-Württemberg class ships to replace the Bremen class with the age of fregs.
We know that it will be equipped with high-fire cannons and various anti-aircraft and watercraft missiles and camouflage technology, including a anti-signal device that reduces ship's radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Another important feature is that it is less often needed for maintenance, which in practice means that these latest quails can be put in service for up to two years away from the mother ports.
However, due to the continuous delay in the project, these high-tech warships, with which Germany could feel its power overseas, may be obsolete when they eventually are put on duty, noted Die Zei.
The heavy feat F125 was published last year when the German Navy officially refused to launch the vehicle and sent it back to the Hamburg Blohm & Voss shipyard.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship back to the manufacturer.
The reasons for the return have not been much of the information, but the German media have several critical “software and hardware errors” that make the warship useless on a battle mission.
Software deficiencies are a major problem, as only 120 sailors will serve on the Baden-Württemberg class ships, which is only half of the crew of the old Bremen class.
It has also been shown that the ship is extremely overweight, which undermines its performance and makes it impossible for the Navy to make further amendments later.
The 7000 tonnes ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ are said to be twice as difficult as German ships of similar class in World War II.
Apart from defective components, the increase in the overall cost of the project, including crew training, is a growing problem.
According to some sources, the cost of the project has already reached an amazing EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion), while the initial draft was EUR 2.2 billion.
In the light of the problems with the new freshwaters, it is particularly important that the maritime presence of Germany is in decline.
Hans-Peter Bartels, President of the National Defence Committee of the German Parliament, recently acknowledged that the Navy “has begun to run out of warships in a state of entry”.
According to the civil servant, the problem has become a self-absorbing process since the old ships had to be offloaded, but there are no more ships to replace the disembarkation.
He was concerned that none of the fregates in Baden-Württemberg could join the Navy bond.
The National Trust is searching for the secret lives of bats
New research is being conducted on a Scottish-upland estate, which aims to find out how bats exploit the features of the landscape while hunting.
Researchers hope that the results will provide new information on the behaviour of single-flying mammals, which can also benefit from subsequent racial protection initiatives.
National Trust for Scotland scientists will examine the behaviour of common and soprano midwives and brown long-haired bats and water bats in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
At the appropriate points of the area, special recording equipment shall be placed in order to record the activities of bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will collect mobile data using manual detectors.
A detailed analysis of the recordings can determine the frequency of bat sounds and what the species is doing.
Researchers also draw up a habitat map and report to help determine in detail how animals behave depending on the landscape.
According to Rob Dewar, the NTS Nature Council, the results will show what are the most important habitats for bats and how they will be used by which species.
This information will help to determine the beneficial effects of habitat management work, such as the development of nests, and how forest areas can best be preserved for bats and other species concerned.
In the territory of Scotland and the United Kingdom, the size of bat populations has decreased considerably over the last century.
Construction and territorial development works interfere with animal sleeping areas and reduce their living space.
Wind turbines and public lighting are also a risk factor for them, just as they are placed on flypapers, certain chemicals used for construction materials, and attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their nightly predator, they rely on their hearing much more when they are hunting for a preacher than on their vision.
Based on their sophisticated technique of ultrasonic reflection, they can determine the exact position of insects and the spatial objects they are heading for.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings across the country, 38 gardens and 76 000 hectares of land, takes the bats issue very seriously.
They work with ten qualified professionals who regularly conduct studies and sleep-site examinations, and occasionally participate in rescue work.
The organization has created the first and only dedicated bat reservation in Scotland on Threave in the area of Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten bat trees in Scotland.
According to David Thompson, the area is an ideal place for bats.
“Here ,Threave has a great place for bats, ” he said.
– There are old buildings, lots of old trees, and everything else that is necessary for a good living space.
But we don't know much about bats yet, and thanks to work here and in other similar areas, we can learn more about what they need to feel great."
It also highlighted the importance of ensuring that bats live there before the renovation of the buildings, as the destruction of a single site could result in the destruction of 400 female and young individuals, which could lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected by the law against their destruction, harassment, and the bottling of their habitats.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish representative of Bat Conservation Trust, also asked for the help of the population.
He said: “There are still many things we do not know about bats, and we have almost no information on the situation of most of the populations of the domestic species.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges, his lawyers are suing the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo described rape charges against him as "false news", and others believe that they want to use his name to "get into public consciousness".
His football attorneys are ready to sue the German week-end, Der Spiegel, for charges.
A member of the Portuguese framework and the Juventus Battle was accused in 2009 of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
According to the woman, the athlete paid her 375 000 dollars to listen to the case, written by Der Spiegel on Friday.
The 33-year-old Ronaldo, in a Instagram Live video, told his fan camp 142 million that the news was "truck".
“No, no, no, no and no.
What they put together today is all lies," he told the camera about the five-time goldball player.
"They want to use my name to get into public consciousness.
It happens.
They want to be famous with my name, that's the life of public actors.
I'm a happy man, and my life is fine," he added with a smile.
As a result of claims called "unacceptable suspicion of privacy", Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel, says Reuters.
According to Christian Schertz’s lawyer, a player’s claim for damages will be made “to the extent appropriate to the seriousness of the offence, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of his or her personality rights over the last few years.”
This was allegedly the case in June 2009 in one of the suites of the Hotel Palms and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went up to the sportsman's suite, where the man raped analysed woman, standing in the file submitted to the district attorney's office in the county of Nevada at Clark County.
Mayorga claimed that Ronaldo was kneeling after the incident and told him that he was “99 percent good boy, ” except for a single percentage.
Based on the information contained in the documents, Ronaldo admitted that he had sexual relations with the woman, but he said that this was done with mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and at a hospital she also made a visit about her injuries, but later she agreed on an out-of-court agreement because she was "feared by retaliation" and "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman would like to repeal the agreement now, as the trauma caused by this case continues to make her life miserable.
Ronaldo was in the process of the alleged attack before re-enactment (from Real Madrid to Manchester United) and this summer the Italian giant bought the player for 100 million euros.
Brexit: the United Kingdom will “treat forever” the loss of car factories
The United Kingdom will “treat forever” if it loses its world leader in car manufacturers after Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister for Enterprises.
Then he added: ‘I am concerned by’ the statement made by the Tokyo UK to the BBC that, if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement, it will be necessary for the car factory to temporarily stop production at the plant in Burnastonian near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
According to the Japanese car manufacturer, in the case of a non-agreed Brexit, jobs may be lost due to delays at the border.
Last year, 150,000 cars were manufactured by the Burnastonian plant, which produced the “Toyota Auris” and “Avensis” models, which accounted for 90% of their exports to the rest of the European Union.
"I see that, if the United Kingdom falls out of the EU at the end of March, production stops will take place in the factory," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Tokyo Burnastonian.
Other car manufacturers in the UK (including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) expressed concerns about the possibility that the country would leave the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, declared that it would shut down the company of Miniket’s company in Oxford for a month after Brex.
Car manufacturers are most concerned that a non-contractual Brexit poses risks in relation to the supply chain.
The production line of Tokyo operates on the basis of ‘open-time’, the components come from suppliers operating in the United Kingdom and other EU Member States every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU without an agreement on 29 March, cross-border disturbances may lead to delays in production and component shortages, according to industry representatives.
According to Tokyo, it would be impossible to store sufficient spare parts for more than a day in Derbyshire's plant, and production should therefore be stopped.
Clark said that the plan for future relations with the EU, known as Theresa May Chequers, “is designed in a way that avoids delays at the border.”
"We need an agreement. We want an agreement on the best possible conditions, which not only gives us the fruit of our current successes, but also offers new opportunities," he said in his BBC Radio 4 Today.
– Not only Tokyo, but other producers can confirm that we definitely need to maintain our highly successful supply chain."
While Tokyo could not tell how long it would be for production, it warned that the associated costs could undermine the company's competitiveness in the long term, which could ultimately lead to job losses.
According to Peter Tsouvalaris, who worked for 24 years at the plant in Burma, and is currently in the service of the Unione trade union, the union members are increasingly concerned: "I have seen that jobs that cease at this time will never be returned."
One government spokesperson said: "We have developed a concrete and feasible plan for future EU relations."
You can postpone Trump and Rosenstein's meeting again, the White House announced.
"You can postpone it for another week" Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Donald Trump, as the debate around Brett Kavanaugh's supreme court candidate continues to continue and the White House issued a communication on Sunday.
Mr Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who examines the Russian influence on the elections, the possible relations between Trump's advisors and the Russian government and the possible obstruction of justice by Trump.
In Washington, they've been guessing for months whether Trump will eventually lose the Deputy Attorney General, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence.
According to this monthly report of the New York Times, Rosenstein considered that he would arrive at the meeting wired in order to record his conversation with the President, and the question was whether the 25th amendment would enable Trump to be replaced.
Rosenstein denied what he said.
Last Monday, however, he visited the White House, and the rumor was to submit his resignation.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday in front of the United Nations.
Trump said that he would be running Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed so as not to conflict with the Senate Justice Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who suspected him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which has led to further delays in the final Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, made a visit to Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he replied: “We still don’t have a scheduled date, or we can set it for this week, but in the light of the cases before the Supreme Court, I see another one - week delay.
I will soon find out, and I will, as always, inform the press."
However, some journalists expressed doubts about this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since 10 September.
Director Chris Wallace also asked me about this.
Sanders replied that the rareness of press conferences was not due to the reaction of television reporters to their behaviour as a "sensationist", but he added: "I do not dispute the fact that I am actually a sensationist."
He then indicated that direct meetings between Trump and the press would take place more frequently.
"The president gave more questions and questions than any former president," he said. He even added, without supporting the claim, "We looked after the numbers."
Press conferences will continue, Sanders said, “but if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, then light - years are better than talking to me.
We often try to do so, and in the last few weeks there have been a number of such events, so they can speak to the President of the United States in person instead of the White House press conferences."
Trump regularly responds to reporters' questions when leaving the White House or attending public events or perhaps press conferences with visiting dignitys.
However, the press conferences held alone are rare.
Why, perhaps, can we conclude from what happened this week when the president in New York has been producing a strange performance in front of all the journalists gathered.
The head of the health case has addressed the EU staff of NHS Scotland in a letter for concerns about Brexit
The head of the health case expressed the country's gratitude in a letter to the employees of the Scottish NHS from the countries of the European Union and stressed that he hoped they would remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the United Kingdom was expected to leave.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the costs of applications for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “The negotiations on exit between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued during the summer, which are expected to result in a decision in the autumn.
The UK Government has also taken the initiative to prepare a possible non-agreed scenario.
I'm aware of what a disturbing time this may be for you.
That is why I would like to highlight once again how much I appreciate the efforts made by each member of the team, regardless of which country they come from.

Christion Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after having a head injury.
On the Tennessee State Tigers linebacker, Christion Abercrombie performed an emergency surgery after he suffered head injury in the 31-27-to-end match against the Vanderbilt Commodores team on Saturday.
The director of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told journalists that the damage occurred shortly before the half-time.
"He walked out to the coastline and just fell," Reed said.
The training team and the members of the health staff first gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the track and then put him on a stretcher and took him to further tests.
One of Tennessee State's authorities in Nashville, Tennessee, told Chris Harris, a WSMV reporter, that Abercrombie was out of surgery performed at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “for the time being, he does not know more details about the type and extent of the injury”, while Tennessee State is working to determine exactly when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student who has been rested for a year, spends his first season on Tennessee State's team, where he's certified from Illinois.
On Saturday, she presented a total of five successful gears before leaving the field, so it's already at 18.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher fee for properties purchased in the UK
According to Toryk's new plan, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher tax on properties purchased in the UK and the homeless would be supported by the resulting surplus income.
This step would neutralise the success of Corbyn among young voters
The increase in the levy is aimed at those who are not taxed in the United Kingdom.
According to the Treasury, this would amount to £120 million per year to support homeless people.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher fee for properties purchased in the UK, and the resulting surplus income will be used to support homeless people, and theresa May will be announced at a press conference today.
The aim of this action is probably to offset the success of Jeremy Corbyn among young voters, which he has achieved by promising more affordable housing and measures for the high incomes.
The increase in the levy affects individuals and companies who are not taxed in the United Kingdom and the resulting surplus income will be used to combat homelessness.
The additional levy added to the current levy, which can be calculated over a higher levy on second dwellings or on real estate purchased for expenditure two years ago or up to three per cent.
As a result of the measure, the Treasury expects a revenue of GBP 120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built London's real estate is purchased by non-UK citizens, causing a significant price increase, which is making the situation of the first tenants increasingly difficult.
Many of the rich regions of the country have become a "spirit city", especially in the capital, as many foreign customers spend most of their time outside the country.
The new bill came only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in fees to help young people preparing to wait for their first home.
He claims that the construction companies are responsible for keeping the real estate prices high, who have become a habit of purchasing and leaving the land on the market. He asked May to cancel quotas for affordable houses and to start with something about the "housing market situation" in the country.
Corbyn has announced a series of outstanding proposals on housing reforms, including rent control and the elimination of unwarranted discharges.
It would also provide more powers and opportunities for councils to build new houses.
May said: “I used to say that I wanted to devote my Prime Minister to the restoration of the English dream, and that life would be better and better for every generation.
This requires a solution to the real estate market situation.
Britain is still, as always, open to those who want to live, work and start a family here.
However, it is not right for individuals living outside the country and for companies of foreign interest to be able to buy real estate just as easily as English citizens work hard.
Dreams made from their own homes became almost unreachable for too many people, and the unfair condition of homelessness became too accessible."
Jack Ross: "I want to be the head of the Scottish team."
Jack Ross, the coach of Sunderland, said that "the greatest desire" was once to be the head of the Scottish National Team.
The 42-year-old Scottish coach would like to take up the challenges of resurrectioning the North East Club, which is currently in the third position of the First Class League, with only three points behind the first position.
He then transferred his seat to the Stadium of Light stadium after successfully returning St. Mirren's team to the first-class Scottish football championship in the previous season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
Unfortunately, however, I was only able to get into the reserve room," Ross said in his Scottish program BBC Sportssound.
– When I was a kid, I watched a lot of Scottish team games in Hampden with my father, and something always came back to them.
But now I only have a chance to succeed as a club manager."
There's Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allerdyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio on the top of the Sunderland manager's office.
The former coach of Allaoa Athletic is not concerned that he has to follow up on such names, and he has previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's offer.
“At this moment, I will measure the success of bringing the team back to the first class.
If we take the structure and facilities of the club, it is undoubtedly the first-class league, he said.
– It will not be easy to get back, but it is more than likely that I will only consider my activity as a success here if we can get the club back."
Ross's management career began only three years ago after he was a former coach at Dumbarton's team and spent 15 months at Hearts' gym.
Then Aolla helped her get back on her feet after the team fell back into the third class, and St. Mirren was on the verge of falling out in the next season.
Ross claims he feels more confident now than ever in his playful career, whether in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren or Hamilton Academical.
“It was a decisive moment, ” he recalled the time spent as a coach for Alloo.
– I clearly thought that management was more for me than to be a player.
That sounds weird, because I've done well, I've had a pretty good life out of it, and I've had some really memorable moments.
The lives of players, however, are sometimes very tough.
There's a lot of things to go through every week.
Of course, I still have to deal with the stress and pressure of the work, but management tasks lie with me.
I've always been interested in management, and now that I've tasted it, I feel the best in my skin since I was a grown-up."
The full interview will be broadcast on the Radio Scotland channel on Sunday, 30 September, from 12:00 to 13:00 local time.
According to a study, at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, the best beers fall.
In the summer heat wave, the traffic of heavy English pubs has increased considerably, but food chains are still under great pressure.
According to the data collected, revenue from pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, an employee of the CGA Business Advisory Company statistics, said: “As a result of the sunny period and the longer-awaited world championship role of England, the trend of the previous month continued in July, when pubs experienced an increase of 2.8% in revenue, with the difference that there was an even greater decline in the number of restaurants.
The decrease in revenue from restaurants in June was further deteriorated in July.
Most of the pubs and bars selling alcohol were the best performers, who produced even more growth than the loss at the restaurants.
The pubs that offered food were also affected by the long-lasting sun, although not nearly as dramatic as the operators of restaurants.
It seems people are more in a mood to drink at this time of year.
The revenue from drinks from pubs and bars run by companies increased by 6.6% this month and the revenue from food fell by 3%."
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality RSM analyst, said: “These results follow the trend that has been outlined since the end of April.
Weather and major social and sporting events continue to be the main source of revenue for the entertainment and catering industry.
It is not surprising that the food chains are in a difficult situation, and the annual revenue loss of 4.8% can be particularly painful due to the constant cost pressure.
It could not have been worse for long, hot summers for restaurants operators, and it will only take time to find out whether the more moderate weather in August will bring relief in this area."
The total increase in revenue for pubs and restaurants was 2.7% in July, including newly opened places, which reflects the slow pace of the introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors and analyses the sales of the US hospitality sector (pubs, bars and restaurants) as a widely accepted industry benchmark, collects and analyses performance data from a group of 47 members with an important total turnover of over 9 billion.
One in five children has social media accounts that they hide from their parents
According to a survey, one in five children (at 11 years of age) has social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
According to a survey of 20,000 high school students, the number of “Insta” sites is increasing
Because of the news, fear of sharing sexual content increases
20% of students replied that they have a "priority" account that their parents can see.
One in five children (at 11 years of age) creates a social media account that they hide from adults.
According to a survey conducted with a request from 20,000 high school students, the number of Insta-sales is increasing rapidly, which refers to Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news increases fear of sharing sexual content.
20% of students replied that they have an unmaculated “head” account that their parents can see, but they also create private accounts.
A mother who accidentally found the secret side of her 13 - year - old daughter found a teenage profile that said "rap me."
According to research carried out by Headmasters’ and Headmistrasses’ Conference (HMC), the Directors and Directors of Digital Software UK and independent schools, 40% of the 11-18-year-olds have two profiles and 50% have admitted that they have private accounts.
“I find it worrying that so many teenagers feel that they must create an online space where parents and teachers cannot reach them,” said the head of HMC, Mike Buchanan.
Eilith Doyle will be the "sporting voice" of the Scottish Athletic Association
Eilith Doyle was elected as the non-executive director of the Scottish Association of Athletics at the annual meeting of the Management Board.
Doyle Scotland's most successful athlete, and the chairman of the board, Ian Beattie, said that sports decision-makers will be an invaluable help from his extensive international experience over the last decade.
“Eilith is accompanied by great respect in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the international Athletic Community, and its presence will help the development of Scottish athletics,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am happy to be the voice of athletes, and I hope that I can really help Scottish sports leaders.”
Two of the four Olympic gold medals of the American athletes who regularly expressed themselves at BBC gained 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlantic Olympics, but were forced into a wheelchair due to a temporary brain circulatory disorder.
He wrote on his Twitter page: “I got a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me if I'd come back in time.
With trying human work, but I've managed to fully recover, I can walk again, I'm going to an agility training today!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages."
Breast-feeding promotions that compare mothers to cows share online community
A strong online discussion was brought about by the advertising of a breast - sucking company that compared breastfeeding mothers to headgear.
According to Elvis, he developed “the world’s first quiet, portable bra” and was advertised in ironic commercials for music videos, which showed what freedom the device gives to milk-sucking mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a cow stand full of straw, while the song about the following lines can be heard: “Yes, I’m thinking of myself, I’m not even a dick” and “if you hadn’t noticed, they’re not a bug, but my breasts.”
And the frenzy sounds like, "I'm pumping, pumping, eating big, pumping, pumping, banging girls."
The advertisement published on the company's Facebook page was quickly crucified by online discussions.
The video has reached 77 000 views and has received hundreds of comments showing mixed receptions. Many say that advertising is a nuisance of the dairy industry's "horror."
“It is very tasteless to promote the product with cows.
Like us, their bodies produce milk only if they give life, but they lose their ribs within days," recalls one of the speakers.
The elvie breast-feeding can be placed discreetly in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother )
Another comment says: “Yes, it is terrible for both the parent and the calf.
But why don't we use them to sell breasts to mothers who can keep their children?"
Someone else added, "Totally insensitive advertising."
Others came to protect the commercial, a woman admitted that she thought the video was "incredibly funny."
“I think the idea is brilliant.
I would've bought it if I'd still been breast-feeding.
I felt like a cow, too.
It's a crazy commercial, so I'm not even trying to see it anymore.
The product is brilliant," he wrote.
Another commentator said: “This is a funny advertisement for mothers who make their milk at work or in a toilet, who feel like “the cow” for this reason.
It does not honor or judge the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show that while dancing, they had the discrete breasts in their bra.
The campaign is based on the feeling that women who use breasts sometimes feel like cows.
Elvie Pump, on the other hand, is quiet, does not use wires and tubes, and can be discreetly placed in a breast - feeding bra, so women can move freely, hold their children in hand, or even move out while breast-feeding.
Ana Balarin, co-owner and communication director of Mother, said: “Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product, and therefore it was necessary to declare it provocatively.
We wanted to draw attention to the challenges of using breasts and, in a funny way, to the sense of freedom of our breasts in comparison with this."
Elvie's breasts didn't get on the news for the first time.
At London Fashion Week, a two - year - old mother entered the runway in Marta Jakubowski’s clothes while using the product.
Hundreds of children were secretly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of children in custody has reached a record, while the number of monthly border crossings has not changed much. This is partly explained by the fact that the brutal rhetoric and measures of Trump administration make it harder to find host homes for them.
The recipients are typically illegal immigrants themselves, and they fear that they would worsen their chances of staying in the country if they applied for children.
This threat continued to increase in June when the host parents and the adults living with them had to give fingerprints and share these data with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Environment in his statement made before Congress last week, acknowledged the arrest of dozens of people who applied for the admission of minors who arrived without an escort.
The Bureau later confirmed that 70% of the detainees were unpunished.
"80% of the applicants and of the household are illegally staying in the country, and a significant part of them are convicted criminals.
Therefore, we continue to search for such individuals," Albence said.
In order to speed up the procedure for children, new rules have been introduced, according to which a part of them must appear before the court within one month of their arrest instead of 60 days, claims social workers.
Many people report to the court through videoconferencing instead of personal appearances to apply for a residence permit.
If the judge does not grant legal protection, the immigrant will be deported quickly.
In recent months, social workers and workers in the system have reported that the longer it takes to be taken into custody, the more nervous and depressed children will be, and the chances of violent outbreaks or escape attempts will increase.
According to lawyers, these risks are only increased by a larger facility such as its gymnastics, where the number of children makes it harder to filter out those in need of psychological care.
They added that if they did not provide enough time for children to prepare themselves or to say goodbye to friends before being transferred to such facilities, they would be put into even greater trauma.
Syria called for immediate departure of the American, French and Turkish ‘invasive forces’
Despite the civil war that took place in the country eight years ago, the Secretary of State Walid al-Moualem, who spoke before the UN General Assembly, asked Syrian refugees to return to their country.
The Deputy Prime Minister, who also took the position of Prime Minister, said that foreign forces have illegally entered Syrian territory on the basis of the fight against terrorism and will "be treated like this."
"They must withdraw without any condition," said the Assembly.
Moualem proved that “the war against terrorism will soon end” in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He declared that Damascus “will continue his holy fight to purify the entire territory of Syria” from terrorist groups and “the illegal foreign presence.”
The 2000 U.S. soldiers are present in Syria, as training and advisors for the Kurdish forces and the Arab militias fighting the Basar El-Asad.
France has sent over 1,000 soldiers to the country affected by the war.
With regard to refugees, Maualem claimed that the conditions were appropriate for their return and that only "single Western countries" were arousing "irrational fears", alarming refugees from returning home.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help the people return home," he said.
They made politics out of a purely humanitarian question."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be granted to Syria until a political agreement has been reached between Azerbaijan and its opposition to the end of the war.
According to UN diplomats, the recently established agreement between Russia and Turkey, which will create a conflict between the last great suburb of the rebels around Idlib, can facilitate further negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented the Syrian government forces supported by the Russians from launching a widespread attack on the three million inhabitants of the province.
However, Mr Moualem stressed that the agreement set out clear deadlines and indicated his hope that military action would target only jihadists, including an An-Nustra Front linked to Al-Qaida, which "must be cut off".
The UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that a committee of government and opposition delegates will soon be convened to prepare the Syrian constitution after the war and prepare the elections.
Amongst the terms of the Moualem, the Syrian government's participation in the Committee, for example only "review of certain articles of the current Constitution", is acceptable and prevents all external actors from being involved in the process.
That's why they're re-electing Trump.
Following this logic, Trump will certainly be re-elected in 2020, unless the hopes of a number of liberal viewers come true, and a liability procedure or a scandal will not end its presidency.
We can be sure that this would be "the most dramatic presidential final of all time."
For now, however, the viewers enjoy the show.
Since 2014, CNN's main-time view has doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC has almost tripled its views to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen's data, Fox News attracts an average of 2.4 million viewers in the main show instead of 1.7 million four years ago, and the Rachel Maddown Show at MSNBC is the most watched cable TV show with its 3.5 million audience, which will be achieved in the evenings of the major news.
“We are attracted as a fire, because something we do not understand,” said Neal Baer, the leading producer of the drama series of ABC’s “The Survivor”. In this series, the office has a low-ranking ministrike sitting in the President’s seat after the death of the Capitol in an attack.
Nell Scovell veteran comedy writer, “Just the Funny Parts: And the Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys“ Club” has a different view.
In this way, he will raise a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 election:
The driver told me he was going to vote for Trump.
“Why,” asked Scovel.
"For he makes me laugh," the driver replied.
It's the fun of chaos.
Of course, unlike TV series, stories from Washington can determine the fate of cases such as Roe vs Wade-precedens, whether immigrant families and the stability of the world economy can reunite.
Only a very narrow layer can make sure you don't care about these facts.
However, it is no longer a part of the responsible information when we have been staring at a discussion show for the sixth hour in which the anonymous background conversations used in Bob Woodward’s book “Father” are authentic, or Paul Manafort’s 15 thousand-dollar Structar jacket (as described by the Washington Post) or the consequences of his description of Stormy Daniels Trump’s anatomy.
As far as I'm concerned, that's what I'm always thinking about Super Mario from now on.
“Man has a feeling that he is watching a reality show where we get something new every night,” says Brent Montgomery, the director of Wheelhouse Entertainment, who is the creator of the “Cathedral Stars”. In Trump’s show, the players are constantly changing and new turns are coming every day (such as N.F.L. starts to praise Kim Jöngunt).
If you miss one part, you'll miss it right away.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was a nice 26-degree, sunny time in Kauin, yet he was in his house looking at MSNBC while recording CNN's show.
He couldn't break off the TV as Brett Kavanaugh's hearing began at the Senate Justice Committee, where the future of the Supreme Court itself was at stake.
“I remember when we produced those crazy shows, people said this was the beginning of the end for Western civilization,” Fleiss recalled.
I thought they were joking, but it seems they were right."

Both parties spend money on the most close competitions for the mid-term congressional election
No one was surprised that both parties in the 17th constituency of Pennsylvania were spending the money countlessly after two active representatives fought for the same chair after drawing the congress districts.
One of the competitions for the recently re-created Pittsburgh suburbs is Democrat Conor Lamb, who obtained an interim election last spring.
Lamb's opponent, the Republican Keith Rothfus, is currently a representative of the former 12 constituencys of Pennsylvania, which shows a significant overlap with today's 17th district.
The map was to be drawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania established in January that the former district borders were manipulated to the advantage of the Republicans.
In the fight for the 17th district, the two funding bodies, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) were almost licensed to each other during the campaign.
Lamb’s name became known in Pennsylvania after winning the March interim election in the 18th Congress district of Pennsylvania in close competition.
For more than a decade, his seat was owned by the Republicans, and Donald Trump won the district with 20 exact advantages.
According to political experts, Democrats have a slightly better chance of winning.
The United States was considering sanctions against El Salvador for support from China and then resigned from the plan.
According to the diplomats, the Dominican Republic and Panama are already on Beijing's side, which Washington has hardly responded to.
Donald Trump was in a good mood with President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and he had a hotel in Panama until his partners forced Trump Organisation's leadership team out of there.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs called back the US agencies’ chief staff from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, “due to their recent decision not to support Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, the Minister’s spokesperson.
However, sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about 140 million US aid, including in the fight against drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed criminal measures, such as the reduction of financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have had a painful impact on the Central American country, where the unemployment and murder rates are also very high.
As the closed meetings continued, North and Central America's competent authorities postponed a high-level conference on security and economic issues, which would have been a continuation of a similar meeting last year, with the primary objective of reducing migration to the United States.
In the middle of September, high-level representatives of the administration made it clear that I would like to hold the conference, which clearly indicated that they did not want to punish El Salvador.
It was announced that at the conference scheduled for mid-October Vice-President Mike Pence would also speak, which according to the diplomats clearly indicates how important the administration considers the event to be.
The three U.S. delegates returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, and Washington did not issue convictional statements and did not take criminal action.
The White House spokesperson John Bolton did not wish to comment on the details of the debate which three US officials, including two diplomats, had reported anonymously.
Their reports were supported by external analysts close to administration, who were also willing to speak anonymously.
Historical Experience
The next blow could be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who will investigate whether Trump has prevented justice in some way... and many of the facts that have been made public.
Mueller's investigation also includes whether Trump's team cooperated with Russia trying to influence the elections.
If the Democrats are put in majority in Congress, they will certainly try to bring Trump to account, whose voters may also have to face up to the judgement of their fellow politicians.
We can see that there are a lot of uncertain questions, and the fall of Trump is far from inevitable... as it is for his European friends.
Serious decisions must be taken on both sides of the Atlantic – depending on how long the fight will last.
In 1938 a number of German officers were willing to pluck Hitler, just waiting for the West to stand next to the Czechoslovakian in Munich.
The aid has not been granted, so it has not been possible to prevent the bloodshed of the following years.
It is at similar historical turns to speed up or slow down the inevitable development of democracy.
In today's America, we can identify multiple such turning points.
What are we gonna do if Trump replaces Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's investigation of Mueller?
Rosenstein's chair has been whining since last year when, as our newspaper reported on it, it was suggested to record talks with the president and suggested that Trump's inappropriate office should be filled.
Rosenstein said the Times reported the events inaccuracies.
“How will we react if the F.B.I. investigation against Brett Kavanaugh becomes biased or incomplete, and in spite of a credible sexual harassment charge, is appointed a member of the Supreme Court?
And the most important question is, in the interim election, we are voting for a Congress that is ready to take responsibility for Trump?
If we fail these trials, democracy will look forward to a long winter.
I trust it won't happen, especially because of my experience in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, the same regime that once served as an ambassador in my home.
My mother survived the holocaust, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, asked me to light candles on the table bearing the sign of thethrastics during the time of Sabbath.
With this cultural heritage, how can I be pessimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans is confident about the Rangers game against Rapid Wien
The Rangers will take Rapid Wien on Thursday. The Austrian victory can ensure them participation in the Group of the European League G after the unawaited tie against the Spanish Villarreal.
Because of Graham Dorrans' knee injury in the midfield, he was unable to take the course of the season against Villarreal, but he feels that building on this result, the Rangers can set more daring goals for himself.
“There was a significant point against the Villarreal team,” said the 31-year-old player.
– We believed that we could score, and we brought a point.
Maybe we could've pulled another goal at the end, but we can't complain about the tie.
They were better in the first half, and we turned them on in the second half.
Thursday's another important European game.
I hope we can get the three points, but it won't be easy because they were pretty good at their last match, but with our fans behind our backs, we'll definitely have the strength to win.
Last year was hard enough, I was injured, there were a lot of changes around the club, but now the mood is very optimistic.
We have a good team, guys enjoy the game, workouts are good.
I hope that if we put everything behind us, we can leave the previous season behind and achieve good results."
A lot of women worry about not saving enough for their age
Those who took part in the survey had accurate ideas about what kind of old - age care they wanted, but only a small part of it talked to their family members.
According to the Nationalwide survey, only half of the respondents discussed with their spouse the expected costs of their elderly care.
Only 10% of them responded by talking to their children about this.
“ Everyone wants a family member to take care of them, but they don’t usually raise a subject,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
The next thing you know, it's worth it.
First, discuss this with your spouse and children: You cannot expect them to take proper care of you if you do not tell us in time what your needs are.
Together with their advisors and family, they choose where and what kind of care they want; these decisions will have a significant impact on later costs.
Take in a financial advisor: he can give you useful ideas on how to pay for the planned benefits.
Funding can be accompanied by a traditional insurance policy designed for old-age care, or a hybrid savings insurance that can cover expenses or use its own assets as a cover... if there is enough resources to cover it.
Prepare the legal documentation: so they cut ahead the possibility of subsequent legal proceedings.
Trust a representative, a trusted person who acts on your behalf on health issues, supervises your medical care and ensures that everything happens according to his expectations even if you are unable to communicate.
Trust someone to handle their finances.
This trusted person makes the necessary financial decisions and arranges for the payment of the accounts when you are unable to do so.
Remember the details: Let’s assume that your elderly parent is in a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer any questions about your medications and allergies?
Such data shall be recorded in writing to be available at any time.
"It is not just the financial issues that need to be clarified, it does not matter who your doctor is," Martin added.
“What medicines are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Everything must be planned in advance."

Earthquakes and fountains in Indonesia
At least 384 people lost their lives on Friday, when a massive earthquake struck the city of Palu, Indonesia, and the authorities said that the number of victims could continue to increase.
The communications network in the area has also been damaged, so no news has been received from Governor Donggala, north of Palu, where it was the center of the 7.5-force earthquake.
More than 16,000 inhabitants had to be evacuated in Palu.
Some important information is available on the island of Celebes from Palu and Donggala:
The capital city of Palu Central Celebes, on the western shore of the island of Celebes, was built at the end of a narrow bay, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
He was celebrating the 40th anniversary of the city’s foundation, when the earthquake and the fountain struck him.
Governor Donggala spends more than 300 km on the northwest coast of Celebes Island.
The government’s population in 2017 was about 299 200 inhabitants, a less than the province’s administrative region.
Central Celebes is mainly characterised by fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of Donggala.
Nickel mining is one of the most important sectors of the economy, but mainly in Morowali, on the other side of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Response Agency, Palut and Donggala have been hit many times in the last 100 years.
A 1938 fountain killed over 200 inhabitants and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, a flood hit West Donggala, then nine people died.
Indonesia is located in the geographically active Pacific Fire Ring, therefore earthquakes are common.
Only a few of the major earthquakes and fountains of recent years:
2004: A huge seaquake began on 26 December on the west coast of the province of Aceh of North Sudan, which started a flood of 14 countries; they claimed a total of 226 000 lives along the coast of the Indian Ocean; more than half of the victims lost their lives in Aceh.
2005: The Western coast of Sumatra was shaken by a series of strong vibrations between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near Sumatra.
2006: Java, the southern part of the largest island in Indonesia, was shaken by a shock of 6.8, and the subsequent fountain claimed almost 700 victims on the southern shore.
2009: the 7.6-force earthquake destroyed Padang, near the capital of the province of West Sumatra.

Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for domestic violence.
Track Palin, former Governor and Vice President of Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
29-year-old Palin lives in Wasilla, Alaska, and is suspected of acts of domestic violence, hindering domestic violence and resisting arrest, protesting the Alaskan State Police.
According to the police report, when a lady witness wanted to call the police to report the alleged crime, she took her phone.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Dental in advance, with a $500 bail on him, reported by KKUU.
He appeared before the court on Saturday and answered his question of guilt, “not guilty at all”.
Palin is charged with three class A violations, which means a maximum of four years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
They're also charged with class B violations, which could involve a day-to-day lock-up and a $2,000 fine.
Palin's not the first time he's confronted with the law.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
Your mother, Sarah Palin, reported the alleged attack on the police.
The case is currently being discussed by the Alaskan Veterinary Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence and prevention of the reporting of crime, as well as of possession of weapons under alcohol influence in the context of the case.
That's when his girlfriend said he hit him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palint was criticised by several organisations representing veterans when she attributed her son’s behavior to post-traumatic stress from the Iraqi service.
Earthquake and fountain in Indonesia, hundreds of victims
At least 384 people lost their lives after a Friday earthquake on Celebes, Indonesia.
The 7.5-force earthquake caused an earthquake that destroyed thousands of homes.
Systems for power supply and telecommunications have become inoperative, and the number of dead people is likely to increase in the next few days.
The main focus of the earthquake was near Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
In social media, there have been several videos of the arrival of the fountain.
Hundreds of people gathered on the coast of Palu at a ceremony, then the fountain reached the beach.
Federal prosecutors have requested a death penalty for the suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
The federal prosecutors of New York are calling for a death penalty on Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the eight-life terror attack in New York City, which has not been executed in the state since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov was accused of driving a truck from Home Depot in October on a bicycle trip on the street of the West Side of Lower Manhattan, driving a number of pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to prove the legality of the death penalty, prosecutors have to prove that Saipov had deliberately killed eight of his victims and that he was ‘in intention’ to cause injury, in the submission of the attorney's office in the south district of New York.
According to the document submitted, proof of any of the two charges could justify the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was accused of 22 crimes, including eight acts of blackmail, which were used almost exclusively for organised crime, and the destruction and destruction of motorised vehicles.
The attack called for “serious planning and deliberate intent”, claims the prosecutors, and Saipov has carried out its actions in a “serious, cruel, inhumane” manner.
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused pain and loss to the family of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damascus Pagnucco” – he said.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
The South District of New York last asked for a death sentence for a defendant for a decade ago.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but in September 2009 he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
In the federal case of New York, the last death sentence was carried out in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg: the couple was convicted two years earlier of spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court records, the Uzbekistani born Saipov showed no regret in the days and months following the attack.
During the interviews, he claimed that he was pleased about what he did.
Saipov said that the ISIS videos on his phone gave him the idea of an attack, standing on the charges.
According to the police, he asked to put an ISIS driver out in his hospital room.
In all 22 charges, he confessed innocent.
David Patton, one of the state defenders representing Saipov, said that they were “successfully disappointed” because of the prosecutors' decision.
"We believe that the actual death penalty for confession would have been more favourable, and the death penalty would only prolong the suffering of all the actors involved in the case," says Patton.
Saipov's defenses previously asked the prosecutors not to ask for a death penalty on their client.
A Tory Member said that NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations.
In his protest at the Tory Conference, Nigel Farage declared that he was “to challenge the army of the people. ”
According to the former leader of Ukip, politicians must feel the pressure of Eurosceptics after one of Theresa May's partners suggested that Farage should be entrusted with negotiations with the EU.
The conservative Peter Bone who did not complete any office told the participants in the Birmingham meeting that the United Kingdom would have "became long ago" if Farage were the Brexit Minister.
It is well characterised by the pressure from the party that the survivalist Toryk spoke at another protest against Brexit in the city.
May is trying to implement what is contained in the Chers Plan, which requires constant liberalisation between Brexit and the survival parties and the EU.
According to his allies, despite the negative reactions, he is trying to reach an agreement with Brussels so that Eurosceptics and Labour can only choose from his package or from "total chaos".
Bone said at the demonstration at Leave Means Leave held in Solihull (the exit means we quit) that the Chequers alku must be counted.
It recommended that Farage be brought into the House of Lords and that negotiations with Brussels be entrusted to him.
"If he had led the negotiations, we would have already left," he said.
The wellingborough Member added: “I stand by Brexit, but the Chequers alku has to be counted.”
Criticising the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to become servants of others.
We want to make laws of our own country."
Bone rejected the assumption that, since the 2016 vote, there has been a change in the expression: "There is no real basis for the British people to change their opinion and to remain."
Andrea Jenkyns, the Brexit Party representative, also attended the meeting and told the journalists: “I ask only: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the voice of the people.
The Chequers deal is rejected by the public, the opposition will not vote in favour of unpopular party membership, and especially among activists who are working on the ground and who have helped us get to the government.
Forget the Chequers deal and listen to us."
As a sarcastic message to May, he added: “Only the Prime Minister can keep his seat, who keeps his word.”
Farage said at the meeting that politicians must "feel pressure" to avoid betraying the results of the 2016 referendum.
“The trust between us, that is to say, people and our politicians, is now at stake.
They want to sell Brexit, and today we're gathered to send a message, not let them do it."
He turned to the enthusiastic crowd with these words: “I would like our politicians, who are preparing to betray Brex, to feel pressure.
We call upon the people's army to fight against Brexit, and we will not rest until the United Kingdom is restored to an independent, independent, proud country."
In the meantime, the survival parties settled in Birmingham, then held a two - hour meeting in the city center.
Some activists flew the flag of the “Torys Against Brexit” movement this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party lived on conservatives for the purposes of the party because of the security errors at the opening of the conference.
“These people said they had the IT background for a Canada-plus-plus agreement, for a border crossing free of charge and for a free trade agreement with Ireland without borders,” he added.
- They're just talking next door.
There is simply no good Brexit," he stressed.
Warren's "thinking carefully" to start up for the presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the election in November she would carefully consider starting for the presidency.
According to the Boston Globe report, the massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future on Saturday at a public forum in West Massuchusetts.
Warren, who is a regular critic of Donald Trump, is preparing to be re-elected in November against the Republican representative of the State, Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired by Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
For some time now, the guesses have been that he might be the one to replace Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke had a meeting with voters in the 36th retail forum since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he was planning to take office in the presidential election.
In his reply, Warren said that it was time for "women to take part in the restoration of the misguided government in Washington, including taking the highest position".
You've arrested the person suspected of shooting Sims in LSU.
The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced on Saturday that a basketball player in LSU, Wayde Sims, was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference held at 11 a.m. on the east coast.
A video of the Friday shooting was released earlier, and they asked for help to identify the man on the tape.
The 20-year-old Simst, near Southern University, was shot dead on Friday early in the morning.
“Wayde Sims suffered head injury from the shooting, which proved fatal,” said Commissioner Murphy J. Paul on Saturday, as reported by 247sports.
Wayde's friend was involved in protecting him, that's when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted at the interrogation that he was on the scene, had a gun, and he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson's arrest took place without an incident, and he was arrested at the police station in East Baton Rouge.
In Baton Rouge, he played 32 games of nearly 2 metres high in Sims last season, played 10 games, played 17.4 minutes on average, scored 5.6 points, and scored 2.9 points each.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is closer to the world champion's title after the team members have won the victory with Sebastian Vett.
After having qualified for a better place than Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear immediately that the Mercedes team's instructions will play a major role in my race.
Bottas, starting from a no-position position, started well and almost put Hamilton in trouble because he protected his position in the first two circles, which enabled Vetel to attack his teammate.
First he stood in the box, letting Hamilton get stuck in the traffic behind the medium field, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes stood a round later, and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton preceded a close action, during which the Ferrari pilot was reluctant to release the inner arch after twice moved as a defense in the third corner.
The 21st birthday was celebrated by Max Verstappen from the back row of the rascals, and by the end of the first round it was the seventh.
After that, he was driving most of the race because he didn't trade tires to get to the finish line quickly and beat Kimi Räikkönen in the hope of the fourth place.
The 44th stood in the box, but the remaining eight were unable to increase their pace, making Räikköne the fourth place.
“It was a rough day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend, and he was a real gentleman when he was instructed to let go.
The team has done an exceptional job to get the first two seats," says Hamilton.
His body language was really bad.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday, because the senator insisted that he didn't leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter that accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment as a new member of the Supreme Court.
At the meeting in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to Ford's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee, but merely noted that things in the Senate prove that people are “innocent, hateful and lying”.
“What can happen, and the wonderful thing that happened in the Senate in the last few days, when they see anger when they see people angry, haughty, hateful and lying,” he said.
“If we look at the statements and the leaks, they say, ‘Oh, that wasn’t me.
It was not me.”
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember your answer... did you leak the document? – “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I did not leak.”
Well, hold on a second.
No, we didn't leak," he added, mimicking the senator.
A letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and the letter leaked out in early September. However, Feinstein denied that the source of the leak would have been his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims and leak his story,” Feinstein told the committee according to The Hill’s report.
"He asked me to treat him in confidence, and I treated him in confidence according to his request."
However, it seems that his denial was not accepted by the president at the meeting on Saturday night: “I tell you what happened: his body language was very bad.
Maybe he didn't leak it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court accused of sexual harassment by three women, saying that the Democrats used the alleged accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by whatever means they can.
You can see the insolence, the hatred, they don't care who they hurt, who you have to run through to gain power and control," said the President, Mediaite.

Air traffic controller has lost his life so hundreds of passengers on board can escape the earthquake.
As a hero, they celebrate an air traffic controller in Indonesia, who lost his life while making sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people is safely boarded.
More than eight hundred people died and many disappeared after shaking Celebes ’ island on Friday, following a major earthquake in which an exodus occurred.
There are still strong extremisms in the area, and many people have fallen under the rubble in the city of Palu.
However, despite the fact that their colleagues escaped saving their lives, the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly flying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport.
The reason why the Batik Air was left is that it would be safe to take off the flight of the 6321 already on the runway.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought he was gonna crash.
Later, he lost his life at the hospital.
According to the spokesperson of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirai, the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported the case of Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palo.
“We had a very busy heart when we heard the news,” he added.
While the authorities are concerned that the number of deaths may be thousands, the country's disaster response organisation has shown that the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong are difficult to reach.
"The number of victims is likely to increase further, as many people have been trapped under the ruins and have failed to reach many," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the organization.
The waves that reached six metres [6 m] high destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral is held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry assistance and supplies.
A 35 - year - old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “The ambulances are bringing more bodies every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
Small stores have been robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, an Indonesian leader of the International Red Cross, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors in time, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already a real tragedy, but it could be worse than that.
President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived on Sunday, and asked the country’s soldiers to: “I ask all of them to work day and night to carry out their evacuation-related duties!
Ready?" CNN reporting.
Indonesia has already been hit by earthquakes on the island of Lombok this year, in which more than five hundred and fifty people died.
Micronesiai accident: According to Air Niugini, a person has disappeared in the lagoon’s accident
According to the latest communication from an airline operating a plane crash in Micronesia, in the Pacific lagoon, one person was missing, although previously claimed that both the 47 passengers and the crew were successfully evacuated from the sinking plane.
According to Air Niugini's press release, on Sunday afternoon, there's no record of a man's passenger.
According to the airline, he's working with local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not immediately reply to any further information on the passenger, such as questions on his age and nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and personnel after the plane hit the water during the landing at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven had been transported to the hospital.
According to the airline, six passengers stayed at the hospital on Saturday, all stable.
The cause of the misfortune and the exact course of events has not yet been clarified.
According to the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
According to some witnesses, the plane missed the runway.
An American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was very low.
"This is a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes told me that with others, he was able to run in the water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
According to his report, air escorts were panicking and screaming, and he suffered minor head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, nearby ship repairers also helped rescue and delivered people to the shore with an air - conditioned boat before the plane sank 30 metres below water.
Based on the Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people have lost their lives in accidents involving PNG-registration airlines over the last two decades, but none of them have affected Air Niugini.
Analyst compiled the events of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the D.A. presented to the defendant at the retrial trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an information analysis expert.
He introduced to the jury how he compiled the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death with the help of his mobile phone records.
According to Rowlett, he received multiple phone data, which led him to be with Tellis Chambers the night of her death, which contradicts the man's earlier claims, reported by The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was near Chambers when the man said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday, during which he said that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that Tellis was "truck because Nashville was my truck".
Another contradiction was that Tellis said that he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
Based on cell phone data, they only knew each other a week ago.
Rowlett reported that, after Chambers died, Tellis deleted her text messages, calls and contacts from her phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to start closing on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be brought before the jury that day.

Another black one?
The New York Dada sued a party for letting him go after a "rasist" message
A nanny in New York sued a couple for discriminating against a couple after the mother complained in a misdemeanor message that they had managed to apply a ‘ black’ nanny.
The couple deny that they are racists, and the case is likened to “scratching. ”
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was disappointed when she saw that she was black on the first working day of 2016 when Giselle Maurice arrived.
“I don’t understand what you mean!” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after he woke up with his shooting, Plasco-Flaxman, who sensed himself as "indiscriminately", fired Ms. Maurice, claiming that the outgoing nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and was more likely to be a Filipino.
Ms. Maurice's work was paid one day and sent home with an Uber.
Maurice is now suing the party for the dismissal, asking for a daily compensation of 350 dollars for the six-month domestic work she was originally hired for, although without a contract.
"I want to show them to stop the procession, you can't do this," he said to the Post on Friday, adding: "I know this is discrimination."
The couple reacted to the claims of racism that it was reasonable to abolish Maurice’s application because they feared they could not trust him after he was violated.
“My wife sent him something she didn’t mean.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists," said the husband, Joel Plasco, to the Post.
"But would you trust your children to someone with whom he was rude, even if by chance?
Your newborn?
Come on!"
According to Plasco, the case was similar to “smokering”, his wife gave birth only two months ago, and “was in a very difficult situation”.
"Can anyone attack such a thing?
It is not really a good thing to do this," the investment banker added.
While legal proceedings are taking place, the public court has quickly condemned the party in the social media, harming their behaviour and logic.
According to a letter just found, the publisher of Paddington feared that readers would not be able to relate to a talking bear.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the adoption of the book, said of the letter: “It is necessary to imagine ourselves instead of someone who reads first before he is published.
It's quite amusing with this information now that we know what a huge success the Paddington is."
According to his father, who worked as the cameraman of the BBC, before he was inspired to write a children's book about a little bear, he would not have been a nuisance if his work had been rejected, and then added that the 60th anniversary of his book was a bitter success after his father's death last year.
Paddington was called “a very important member of his family” and he added that his father was very proud of his final success.
“He was a very quiet man, he wasn’t delusional at all,” he said.
"But since Paddington was almost real to him, he was like a child who brings him to something: we are proud of him even if we really do not deserve it.
I think you saw Paddington's success somehow.
Although he created it and fell out of his imagination, he always gave himself the success of Paddington."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
When he landed, his daughter and his daughter were at the Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where the doctors fought in vain for his life.
“He regularly called me to tell me that he was in a very bad state and that he was not expected to survive,” said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received a call from Nad, saying that my daughter will die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
I said goodbye.
I said, “Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors gave him to keep his heart beating slowly ran out and then left his body.
He died before, and then everything stopped.
I just had to sit there and wait to know that everything was over.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a place surrounded by families and people.
I couldn't leave myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, when she was grieving for her daughter's loss, she boarded the plane with the others who didn't care about the trial she was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
“I bowed down my head, and my tears swung all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt this over-indulging compassion for Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew he loved my daughter very much."
A card with grieving women to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent them, and others do not throw away their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly have put out postcards filled with inspirational messages and emergency numbers on a Wales Bridge.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when she was depressed and then she committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
The 45-year-old Ms. Davis, who lives in Lydney, told me that her son was a promising cook, and her grin got caught up in everyone's eyes.
“He knew everyone about his smile.
They always said that his smile would turn up any place."
However, he gave up his work before he died because he was “in very bad condition.”
Tyler, who ended his life with his own hands, was found by his 11-year-old brother.
Ms. Davis said: “I was constantly concerned that this would have some domino effect.”
Ms. David made the postcards for the purpose “that people may know, some may be visited and spoken with them, even if it is only a friend.
Don't sit still – you need to talk!"
Ms. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Ms. Davies's for years lost Mark, who had been a partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
"He didn't say he was depressed, depressed, or anything," he said.
“Some days before Christmas, we noticed a change in her attitude.
He was totally under him on Christmas Day: when the kids opened their presents, he didn't look into their eyes and stuff."
He said that his death was a major trauma for them, but they had to deal with it: “He left a great deal of space in the family.
He broke our hearts to pieces.
But we must continue to fight."

Questioner Brett Kavanaugh's future as the FBI begins its investigation
“I thought that if he managed to achieve what he asked for — a limited-time investigation of limited size — we might be able to agree,” said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that the committee held him from “falling to pieces” due to the party’s inability to decide.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and Republican supporters oppose the FBI investigation?
Their resistance can only be attributed to timing.
The interim election is only five weeks away, on 6 November, and if the Republicans are not expected to do well, it will be much harder for them to get their people to the highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators and lobby with them for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, and through him he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI release their report?
They are voting in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will receive the minimum 50 votes in the Senate that would allow the Vice-President, Mike Pence, to take the decision so that he can bring Mr. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean dissidents under Kim's control
The number of North Korean dissidents to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jesongun took power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator declared.
Park Bjengs quoted the data of the Southern Merger Ministry and said that in the last year, 1127 dissidents were compared to 2011, when this number was 2706.
Park said that the stronger border guard between North Korea and China and the higher penalties imposed on smugglers were the main reasons.
Phenjan did not comment on this information publicly.
The majority of North dissidents eventually receive South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans crossed the border illegally since the Korean war ended in 1953.
Most people flee to China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and it is easier to cross than the strictly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between Korea and China.
The dissidents are received by China as an illegal immigrant and not as a refugee and are often sent back by force.
The relationship between the North and South, which is practically still at war, has improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Phenjan, and their meeting focused on the closed nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This was the historic meeting between President Donald Trump and President Kim Dsongun in Singapore in June, where further cooperation on the nuclear-free Korean peninsula was agreed in large lines.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho has been blaming the American sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the Americans, our national security is not affected, and in such circumstances it is unimaginable that we will cut down our weapons unilaterally," Ri said in her speech at the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "histerical", saying she was unfit for the Supreme Court.
The minority president of the House, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court “histerical” and claimed that his behaviour did not correspond to the work of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed himself in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I also thought that if a woman acted like this at any time, I would call her “hysterical”, she explained Pelosi’s reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh protested against the rumors that he would have sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford in their teens.
In his opening speech Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and his voice was shut when he talked about his family and his high school years.
In addition, he strongly condemned the Committee's Democrats, the accusations against him, called "grotesk and coordinated character murder", and was organised by angry liberals because of the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, according to Kavanaugh's behaviour, he proved that he was not fit to work in the Supreme Court because he showed that he was biased against the Democrats.
"I believe that he ruled out with his statements and his conduct against the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi hesitated when they asked him if he would try to take responsibility for Kavanaugh in case it filled the post and if the Democrats acquired the majority in the House.
"I say as much as you don't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, it's not only for the Supreme Court, but it's not for the court where you are right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently in a court-martial position in the capital court of appeal.
Pelosi added that he was concerned as a Democrat about the possible decisions of Kavanaugh on the issue of the Costable Care Act or Roe vs Wade, as Kavanugh is a conservative judge.
During Kavanaugh’s hearings, he avoided questions about whether the Supreme Court’s rulings would be altered.
“There is no time for a hysterical, biased person to be amongst the members of the court, and he expects us to tear away from joy,” said Pelosi.
And women have to keep it under control.
It's a legitimate outburst, months and years of anger that has come to light, and it can't be out of itself without crying.
“We cry when we are angry,” said Ms Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that would be so rare, would it?"
“A woman who worked in a leadership position continued to help me. ” She told me that she was crying in anger, but developed a technique that said, when she began to cry in anger, she said to her talking partner: ‘You may think I am sad because I am crying.
But I am angry.”
And then he went on.
And I thought that was a great idea."
In part, they view tears as a sign of anger because they misunderstand me.
One of my brightest memories of an early job, an office ruled by men, where I once began to cry in my angry indomitance, that an older woman on my neck — a cool manager I've always feared — took me to the stairwell.
"Don't let them see you cry," he said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're gonna be happy because they managed to upset you."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democrat Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught with an out-of-marital affair in a beard called Monkey Business, he fell out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, in his deep frustration, he discovered that there was no reason why he couldn't start for the presidency himself.
“There was no well thought-out decision,” he told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the contest, and the new candidate was wanted in the middle of their backs.
Someone named the Snow Whites and the Seven Smurfs.
Since the campaign has been held for a long time, Ms. Schroeder has missed the fund-raiser, so she has promised not to compete unless she collects the $2 million.
It was a battle for defeat.
He realized that some of his supporters gave $1,000 to men, but he only got $250.
“They thought I was getting a discount,” he meditated.
When a press conference was held about not launching an official campaign, the feelings of gratitude for him and the frustration and anger of the voter against the system that made it difficult to raise money and to reach the voters directly, and because of sexism, were so overwhelmed that his throat was blocked.
“They thought I had a nervous breakdown,” said Ms. Schroeder, how the press reacted to it.
“They thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they're gonna write on my tombstone?
“Crying”?"
How can the US-China trade war be good for Beijing?
The trade war between the USA and China was almost counterproductive, and the battle is still not over, according to the experts, the break between countries can benefit Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States of America launched the first warnings at the beginning of the year by taxing the most important Chinese exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation happened this week, as the new duties already affect a 200 billion dollar product, practically taxing half of the goods from China to the US.
In every case, Beijing imposed a refund on the US product worth $60 billion between the last five and ten percent.
China has promised to fight back every time, and the world’s second largest economy will certainly not back down in the near future.
If you'd like to get Washington to back off, it would mean you're gonna have to give it up in front of the demands, but a public bow to the US would be too embarrassing for the President of the New China.
Yet, according to the experts, if Beijing is doing well, the pressure of the US trade war will be good for China in the long term, as it will reduce dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick decision can create conditions in Washington or Beijing that could trigger any economy in the two countries is much more serious than the observers previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, Research Assistant to Asia at the New American Security.
Syria is “ready” to return refugees, states the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims that it is ready to return to the country that has been destroyed for more than seven years.
In his speech before the United Nations Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Vald Moallem claimed that the state of the country is improving.
"The current situation is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists, restoring normal conditions.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, who had to escape between terrorism and the self-aware economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
According to the United Nations calculations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
The other six million people living in the country need humanitarian help.
Moallem said that the Syrian state would be happy to receive all assistance in rebuilding the country.
However, he stressed that no conditional assistance or cooperation from countries that supported the rebellion would be accepted.
Europe acquired the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, overcoming the US team in 16,5:10,5 percent held out of Paris at Le Gold National.
The United States has now failed in Europe for the sixth time in a row and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe defended its title as Danish team captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 point needed to defeat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, an American star player who was struggling all over the tournament, put his punch in the water at the Par-3 16 hole, giving Francesco Molinari this victory.
The Italian golf player Molinari was bright among all, so he became one of the 4 players who had ever achieved the 5-0-0 results since the tournament started in 1979.
The U.S. Jordan Spieth received 5+4 from the lowest-ranking European team player, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, one of the best players in the world, lost 2&1 against the English Ian Poulter, who may have participated in his last Ryder Cup.
The eight Ryder-cup veterans, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the best winner of the tournament in all times in Europe with the 25.5 career points.
“I don’t cry in general, but I couldn’t stop today.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he chose and believed in me.
I'm so happy. I'm so happy I got the cup back.
This is all about the team, and I am happy that I could help," she said after the European victory of Garcia, who is struggling with emotions.
The staftabot is handed over to Jon Rahm, who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday, 2&1.
“I feel incredible pride in defeating Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching this man,” said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France, and now there's a 13-21-3 career record in Ryder Cup.
It's a weird statistics from one of the biggest players of all time who won 14 major titles, and only Jack Nicklaus is ahead of it.
The U.S. team has been struggling all weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a great golf course throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing outcome of the United States team captain Jim Furyk’s team, he said: “He is proud of these guys for fighting.
There was a time this morning when we set fire to Europe.
We fought.
Put your hat down in front of Thomas.
Great Captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup our team, we will work together with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee to move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be your captain.
You need to lift your hats.
The opponent was better than us."
