European inflation has slipped on food
The rising inflation in the euro zone is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
The rise in the price of November in the 13 countries of the euro zone was higher than expected, with an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent per cent recorded after 2.6 per cent in October - reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
The official forecast was only 3 percent likely - reported by Bloomberg.
Unlike the American, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not cut the base rate, saying that the reduction would lead to inflationary spirals in conjunction with rising commodity prices and low unemployment.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate close to two per cent.
According to an analyst, the ECB is trapped in the twenty-two: 'to talk about' inflation, so that it does not have to act on this subject later.
In Germany, the value of inflation in November is 3.3 per cent as a twelve-year-old record, and in Spain, it rose from 3.6 to 4.1.
Euro-zone inflation was driven high by jumping food and energy prices.
The time-limit wheat quotations increased by 88% and the soya beans' exchange rate has reached the highest value since 1973.
Food oil and dairy products also had to be paid significantly more in 2007.
The world market price for oil increased by 52 percent this year, and last month it cost almost $100 a barrel of black gold.
According to the ECB, inflation is falling from 2.1 to 2.5% this year in 2008, but it is already falling to 1.9% in 2009.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation level remains at around 3 per cent for the next 3-4 months, but the annual average rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to have decreased interest rates twice in 2008.
The Gallup sees a government crisis
Fidesz’s supporters’ circle has grown significantly since the beginning of December after a long stagnation, so now it has the largest camp since 2002, while Gallup has not previously measured such low socialist support for 13 percent.
For the Commissioners, the difference - because of the greater determination of the opposition voters - would mean more than two-thirds (71 percent) support for MSZP's one-fifth (20 percent) support.
According to the survey, MDF and the SZDSZ are below the parliamentary threshold: their support within the general population is two per cent.
Among the Commissioner's voters, the supporters of both camps are one percent more.
There has been no further deterioration of the economic expression at the previous lowest point - there has never been such a high figure, 41% of those who have considered the country's economic situation to be particularly bad, while another 46% said it was quite bad.
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families are now more pessimistic about the change in their financial situation.
For the following year, the larger half of the population will report further deterioration and only one tenth of improvement.
In December, more than any previous survey of Gallup, 71% of those asked, thought that the Prime Minister was doing rather badly than doing his job well.
In Ferenc Gyurcsány, 13 percent of those asked trust or are very confident, while Viktor Orbán has 38 percent of the support.
The Prime Minister has 54 percent no trust at all, 27 percent in the President of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of political developments is how much society thinks that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be dealt with without a change of government.
While 35% of the government and the Prime Minister thought it was desirable to remain after the riot last October, this ratio is now only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33%) sees only the solution in writing out new elections.
The interest in referendums is characterised by the fact that 60 percent of those who have been asked answer the question of the intention to participate is that they are sure to leave, and another 20 percent say they are likely to leave.
As a comparison, only 55% of the elections to be held on a "day's Sunday" would be certain, and another 15 percent would consider their participation likely. The result of the referendum would not be questionable on the basis of what we are about to do.
For tuition, 74 people, 79, and 84 percent of the daily hospital fee would say no.
If we only look at the same proportions among those who are sure to participate in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89% of the voters would reduce the introduction of tuition fees, visa fees and daily hospital fees.
The most expensive is the Auchan, raised nearly a fifth by the Tesco
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade triangle kept the average price increase last year, with the difference that VAT did not rise this year.
Article of the Daily Economy
This year, the average increase in the average trade triangle in Budapest was 16 percent in the Daily Christmas basket, but in each hypermarket there was an increase of over a thousand forints in value.
Since prices have already been "missed" in the food stores in December last year, there has been no dramatic fallout compared to the previous high base.
Yet, it is obviously scary for consumers that what they received last year under nine thousand HUF is not yet available for 10,000.
The daily basket exceeded the ten thousand HUF psychological limit by at least 91 forints in the tested hypermarkets.
The highest basket value was 10 573 forints.
(in 2003 the basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum and live fish remained almost last year's level, but the price of turkey fillets, nuts and sweets is very high.
KSH's data was followed in the stores by the price of flour and bread, although we found a kilogram of bread in Auchan for 139 HUF.
Competition did not drop the price of the product below 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this business that the price of the two-litre interchangeable bottle of Coca-Cola was below 200 HUF, so together with the deposit fee, only 257 HUF was requested for the product.
At the same time, Auchan showed himself to the most expensive in his daily basket, while Cora was to the cheapest.
It is estimated that Cora 15, compared to last year's Christmas prices, increased prices in Tesco and Auchan by about 18-18 percent.
Compared with last year's most expensive and this year's cheapest basket value, the difference was 12 per cent, while last year's cheapest and this year's most expensive between 21 per cent growth.
Forint had an average growth of 1480.
Last year the average price increase came to 1206 forints, with VAT rising affecting prices last Christmas.
It was precisely this process that disbanded trade, and apparently it was not possible for the stores to decide how much margin to apply to a product, because they were unable to calculate the impact on consumption on price change.
(If the rate of rotation of a product is wrongly designed by the trader, it can be of serious benefit to the price adjusted to the traffic intensity.)
Because of VAT, last year the price increase of the daily basket was so extreme that the highest priced HUF 1720 was more than the 2006 value, while the lowest priced HUF 844 was the price difference.
This year, this extreme was not shown, since the most expensive 1630 HUF was more than last year, and the cheapest was 1284 HUF.
Compared with the two Christmas seasons, there was a disastrous increase in prices, and over 30 percent of daily consumption in hypermarkets increased in less than 20 months.
(This does not necessarily justify KSH data: the statistical office has measured a price increase of more than 30 per cent over a period of 12 months for some basic foods.
Like flour in eggs.)
According to the daily basket, this appears almost inability to do so, as the price level of the relatively expensive product has been rising by just over 10 per cent in the worst case than the base.
The suppliers of flour appear to be in a stronger position than the eggers, the dramatic price increase on the multi-stakeholder, was also successful.
In the commercial gold triangle, the hypers don't complain, they keep reporting for a good year.
In our experience, in the three shops visited, most of the customers are no longer interested in prices.
They buy a lot of everything, they take long-lasting food from the platform.
Wednesday morning, in all three stores, there were serious lines ahead of the money prices, because the number of visitors suddenly increased.
However, we know that traffic is weaker in the countryside, that there are several complaints to research firms that even their plans do not involve revenue, but not just food, but also long-term consumer goods.
In many places they save money on disinfectants
More than a thousand infections have been reported in hospitals this year, mainly due to inappropriate use of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions of hospitals, the congestion of beds, the overburden of staff do not favour stopping infections, states the head of the department of the National Epidemiology Centre.
They save money on disinfectants in a lot of places.
An MRSA infection has recently been diagnosed in the traumatology department of the John's Hospital.
After a serious accident, bacteria resistant to antibiotics were detected in men.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the beginning of this year.
The victim of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but soon thereafter he had to return with MRSA infection, and he was unable to perform an important surgery because of the bacteria in his system.
This year, until 10 December 1094 hospital infections caused by multi-resisting agents were reported to the National Nosocomial Survey System, said Böröcz Karolina, head of the department of the National Epidemiology Centre.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have certainly been registered in hospitals, and the rest are not known.
Approximately two-thirds of the infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, the methicillin oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is carried by one third of people without causing the disease in their noses.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. sore throat, mandula, skin infections, ulceration) respond well to antibiotics and can be cured.
However, if antibiotics are used too much or not properly, the bacteria that respond well to antibiotics develop highly resistant to antibiotics, which spread rapidly under inadequate hospital conditions.
In particular, when the immune system is temporarily or permanently poor, severe hospital infections, such as ulceration or blood poisoning, may occur in patients with poor body, elderly or low body weight.
According to the medical director of John's Hospital, MRSA infection has nothing special, such infections belong to the daily practice of hospitals.
The infection should not be mixed with the strain, MRSA is not only there, said Tibor Nyulasi, where the presence of the pathogen is not tested.
Resistance to antibiotics
"The patients are separated, the nursing staff is covered in rubber gloves and masks, and they have the right antibiotics for their treatment," Tibor Nyulasi said.
Patients entering the hospital are first examined whether MRSA is present in their body, but the infection cannot always be avoided.
Not in the fashion of sampling
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current domestic hospital conditions and conditions are not favourable to preventing the development and spread of multi-resistant pathogens, says Böröcz Karolina.
After this infection occurs typically in hospitals, in elderly homes, hospitals should check the patients entering and immediately separate patients taking MRSA.
However, in Hungarian hospitals there is no microbiological sampling in fashion.
It also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these investigations.
Most cases are thus exposed when the patient has detectable MRSA infection, said the head of the epidemiology centre's head of department.
The European Union has strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are domestic guidelines on the cure of individual infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, i.e. microbiological studies should be carried out in order not to develop resistance to drugs, but hospitals do not always follow this.
Microbiological samples are even more rare in the outpatient or primary care, announced by Böröcz Karolina.
Savings on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most commonly used as a means of mediation of healthcare staff from one patient to another.
The use of gloves, masks, therefore, has a very important role to play, but there are also significant shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is spread by contagion, contact, but it is not always possible to separate infected patients under domestic hospital conditions.
In fact, hospitals are often crowded, often very close to each other by beds, while patients should be at least 1.5 metres apart from each other from each other from the pathological point of view.
Unfortunately, it is also observed that Böröcz Karolina noted that in hospitals in a disadvantaged financial situation they save on disinfectants, few nurses, many patients, so there is even more chance of developing infections.
According to Böröcz Karolina, where appropriate precautions are observed, there is a lower evidence of such infection or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
The management of MRSA causes huge expenditure for health insurance companies and therefore they are fighting against it everywhere.
In England, for example, the Government programme included prevention and reduction of MRSA.
It appears that the programme is successful and that MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England, based on the reported data.
The priorities of the European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) include the prevention of the development of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and of hospital infections caused by such agents.
He wasn't drunk with the police captain responsible for the fatal accident.
An official expert opinion was drawn up on the fatal accident caused by District XXII.
There is no way that the police captain of the XXII district who left his post drunkly or in a poised state, who took a pedestrian to his death on Tuesday, was informed by Attila Morvai, spokesperson of the Capital Court on Friday after the expert's opinion on this matter.
The expert opinion supported the primary investigation result, which has already established that the former Commissioner had not consumed alcohol before he was behind the wheel.
At the time, the head of the XXII district headquarters hit a 55-year-old man on Tuesday on Kossuth Louis Street in the district of XXII, who did not want to cross the road in the designated location.
(The latter, therefore, that the pedestrian has not passed through the Zebra, is not a mitigating condition under the rules of the Credentials, so the turn-over driver must still give priority.)
The pedestrian lost his life after transport to the hospital.
As a result of what happened, the district police chief resigned his post and asked him to take his leave of absence, according to police reports, because the case was so shaken.
This case is being investigated by the Budapest Investigation Bureau.
Attila Morvai also explained that the former chief of police had cooperated with the investigating prosecutors from the outset.
Another €400 million for infrastructure
Three credit framework agreements in support of education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy were signed by János Veres, Minister of Finance and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) on Friday in Budapest.
The European Development Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of the Hungarian budget of transport and environmental projects under the Cohesion Fund, of which EUR 100 million has already been signed by the parties, the contract now signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
Education-related projects are also used to finance the budget under the EUR 150 million loan agreement.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary, with the remaining EUR 150 million being used later, with the extension of the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a contract of EUR 50 million, which is mainly used by the budget for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
The meeting was also held by metro 4.
They agreed that when Hungary finalises the details of the financing of the metro with the EU, they will return to whether or not to modify the original contract.
According to János Veres, this could take place in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary with a total of 8.4 billion euros.
The loans shall be granted by the EIB with a duration of 8 years and no maintenance commission linked to EURIBOR.
Bulgaria is an EU property paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing - the attention of Europe as a whole is directed to the little Balkan country mentioned earlier.
What, where and who buy the EU is still the cheapest yet rapidly expensive market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max division.
The most popular property purchase target in Eastern Europe is now undoubtedly Bulgaria, with cheap ski apartments and beach houses.
Among the most beautiful areas of the mountains are Banszko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, and on the beach are Albena, the "Aranypart", the "Napospart", the ancient Sozopol and Neszebár, but more and more people are also looking for real estate in Kavarna and Balcsik.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central part of the country will also attract the interest of investors - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more people will also buy in the very cheap area of Rus.
The capital, Sofia, also has attractive opportunities, and commercial and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on its best path to becoming one of the most attractive European golf paradises, so in addition to the summer and winter seasons it will be a priority destination for the other two seasons.
For this reason, forward-looking investors are already buying heavily, such as around Banszko.
Analysts say that buyers of real estate in Bulgaria are also trying to change their lives, their way of life.
Most buyers are English, but they come from France, Belgium, Spain and more from Romania.
The investors in Malta and Cyprus are also present, and Russian buyers are traditionally present in the Black Sea and Ski Paradise.
Foreign buyers can be classified into three categories, says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
The settlers buy or refurbished real estate at a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros, or rested old houses for 5-15 thousand euros and then refurbished.
They require good accessibility and communication opportunities, important to them is a big city, shops and the proximity of the local doctor in general.
The second category is for holiday shoppers (Bulgaria has been added to the list of its first 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group is composed of business investors who buy in the hope of medium to long-term value growth.
The increase in capital property is continuing, as demand is increasing.
In Bulgaria, real estate prices are the lowest in the European Union, but in the last five years, they have increased by 21% a year.
The increase in real estate prices is essentially more than the increase in payments.
Fodor and six Hungarian percent
According to information from the Minister for the Environment and Waters, expert meetings will be concluded on Tuesday and, following the formal opening on Wednesday, the negotiations with ministers will continue with the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 world countries are discussing the Bali Road Map, which provides for efforts following the 2012 Kyoto Protocol emission reduction period.
This is currently being debated strongly between developing and developing countries.
The United States has also indicated that it does not want to discuss precise figures at the moment, although it is inclined to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40% by 2020 compared to 1990.
Another major issue of the conference is whether developed countries will not only undertake to reduce emissions, but also to provide both financial and technological assistance to those in need.
There was also an agreement on aid to developing countries.
The support fund, which is provided by the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by the 16 Management Boards, expected to be under the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF) - read in the Market and Profit.
Six per cent of Hungary
Mr Fodor, Minister for the Environment and Water, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to preserve the role of the flagship in global climate action and to promote the creation of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that by 2020, the EU will undertake to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, regardless of the success of the post-2012 agreement and is prepared to achieve a reduction of up to 30% if other developed regions of the world and developing countries are willing to assume their responsibilities and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that in 1997 overall, the countries that acceded to the Kyoto Protocol were aiming at reducing by 5.2%, including the EU - then 15 Member States - by minus 8%.
The obligation in Hungary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent compared to the period 1985-87 that will be fulfilled by our country. - reminds the Ministry of the Environment's press release.
There is a high stake in Bali, because it is necessary to bring the long-term international climate agreement to a conclusion within two years, otherwise its entry into force would certainly take place after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction scheme, as indicated in the latest report by the IPCC, the UN Nobel Peace Prize International Panel on Climate Change.
This would result in a delay in emissions reduction and would inevitably result in an increase in the average temperature of the Earth above 2 degrees Celcius, which, according to scientists, would have extremely severe and irreversible consequences.
The British army is recruiting on YouTube.
Records of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan are published on the video division by British military units with which they promote themselves.
First of all, the British Air Force (RAF) has received YouTube: special formations in Afghanistan have been downloading videos of their actions against the Taliban since March 2006 - reported by the BBC.
These miniature tapes, equipped with a helmet camera, will be checked at the Air Force's Chicago Operation Command, and then sent to London, where the domestics will upload them to the Internet.
A political message is essential
The air force soldiers have already recorded 139 recorded them on the Internet in this form, and over 75 thousand viewed their "channels".
The British Ministry of Defence registered as "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and publishes videos of both Iraqi and Afghan activities, while the British Ministry of the Commonwealth Office and the Iraqi International Peace Reserves (NFI) also have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
The Air Force's original intention was to recruit the videos, and the Ministry of Defence said it was also good for the general public to know the real purpose of the military's foreign presence.
The propaganda published in this form does not cost almost anything compared to traditional TV recruitment campaigns - said to the BBC by Gordon Mackenzie, a defense expert - but it has a certain political message, because it is uniquely proof of the legitimacy of military actions decided by the government.
The Americans made a game.
In addition to carefully edited, censored tapes, the army also has a problem with amateur videos, which show, for example, the death of the soldiers: in the slightly hypocriteic "official" propaganda films, officers talk about losses but do not show the bloody side of the fight.
By the way, many videos from Iraq and Afghanistan have already been released on the Internet, which was made on sharp missions, but the British army has recently received them.
The Americans do a little differently, recruit the free download with a shooting game called the American's Army, in which the player can hide directly in the hands of the soldiers as part of a more or less life-long simulation.
It's gonna be a Christmas party and a Christmas party for the ministries.
The Minister of Labour of Lamperth Mónika does not seem to be sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, he will hold an annual workshop for his colleagues, who will be able to have a pogacs and coffee from 2007.
There's a ministry where there's a live music party somewhere else with a blizzard and a drink of Christmas in the hearts of officials.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and Swedish table - so amusing the power.
The state agencies are preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party in the Ministry is held this year by the national defence wallet, but HM is not waiting for the Ministry staff.
On the Christmas of Arvoák, children of fallen soldiers receive a gift, and on the Christmas of the Mission, family members of soldiers currently serving foreign missions will be invited to the press.
The wallet is worth 25 million to the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NDA) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport (GKM) are fired from the shell compared to the other wallets.
The GKM party is held at the future house, with a total of 4 320,000 HUF, and about three hundred and fifty guests from six hundred Ministries.
They're gonna stick to the Christmas mood at the wallet, but there's gonna be performers and there's gonna be a storm.
The NFI’s Christmas cost 4 700 000 HUF, and there were concerts and dinners at the National Justice Council (OIT) building on Wednesday.
The rent cost a million HUF, spending the rest on more than 400 invited persons.
We know that one of the NFA's classes is also officially engaged for another Christmas celebration: this is organised by a tender management company, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre, with EU funding.
For the purpose, the House of the Twilight was rented.
The information was not confirmed at MAG Zrt because we failed to reach the competent authority.
I don't need a suit.
The OIT building not only saw the NFI as a guest, but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held a Luca Day ball on December 7 instead of Christmas.
He didn't ask for money to use the OIT rooms.
Five hundred attended the ball.
The party started with the Minister's toast and could be danced after dinner for live music.
The question of [origo] was asked: the prom was not required at all for evening dress or suit.
Puritan's got a health, work and municipal wallet.
The Ministry of Health organises a program and celebration for workers for HUF 400 000.
However, the Minister of Labour of Lamperth Mónika is officially waiting for his staff to attend not a Christmas party, but a work meeting at the end of the year.
They're expecting a hundred and eighty guests, who, uh, told by the press department, will only get coffee and pugs, so they'll bring the party out of 350,000 forints.
However, the Minister of Local Government of Bajnai Gordon will simply be drinking with his staff in the Aula of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas meeting in its own hall, with 436 employees waiting for it.
Each guest will have 2500 HUF for the Christmas party - the sum will include a buffet bet and a drink.
Since János Veres is the minister, every year, the PM employees have been doing similar things.
But it won't be a Buffet, it won't just be a ministerial speech, it'll be an afternoon time.
On January 20th, the agricultural wallet will give a New Year's bet, the Ministry of Christmas will be missed.
The reception is held in Vajdahunyadvár, in the City League, and according to the wallet, the 100 guests are each planning 1000 HUF.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple standing reception, for which only foreign diplomats accredited to Hungary are official.
These annual bets start with a short ministerial greeting and end with a repressive snack.
At all, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture are not having a Christmas party with [origo] in the competent press departments.
They couldn't tell me the price of the office Christmas of the environmental wallet at the press department.
In any event, more than 400 people were invited to attend the festival at the Museum of Applied Artists.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
On Friday, their strike committee will be formed by the League Trade Unions and the National Federation of Labour Councils.
There will be a large assembly of protests on Saturday, and on Monday - on the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act - the end of the job will begin.
The action will certainly cause significant disruptions in transport, as rail transport will stop almost completely and will strike at BKV for 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the League Trade Unions will present details of their Monday strike organised jointly with the National Federation of Labour Councils.
The LIGA - MOSZ strike committee is also set up, which will coordinate the activities on Monday.
There will be a large assembly of protests on Saturday, and from Monday onwards, the organizations that join the strike will cease the work indefinitely if they are unable to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that it was not marked - on the day of the vote on the Health Insurance Act - on the date of completion of the strike that started.
If the Parliament does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the strike call.
If, on the other hand, the legislation is voted on, the strike committees will sit together and decide on the continuation.
On the basis of the Parliament's Monday agenda, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will only be voted on late in the evening, perhaps at night.
Due to the strike that starts on Monday, significant disruptions can be expected in transport: the work will be stopped for an indefinite period of time on the railways, part of the public transport in Budapest will stop in the morning, with more than half of the Volan companies.
At the same time, there will be a semi-road roadblock in many parts of the country.
A number of trade unions and civil society organisations joined the strike call, their list will be updated continuously on the League Day.
Some organisations reported a strike for an indefinite period of time, others declared temporary termination.
By Thursday afternoon, the Free Trade Association of MÁV and Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) was unable to agree on sufficient service, but as Christmas holidays neared, more and more people travel by rail.
According to previous announcements, they strike at BKV from start-up to 13 o'clock, at Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 o'clock in the morning, a four-hour strike will be held by the LIGA Electrical and Heat Industry Trade Unions, and two or two to eight hours will be called off by the Pedagogues Trade Union and the Democratic Trade Organisation of Pedagogues.
The Hungarian Medical Association strikes nationwide, at changed times, and a two-hour warning strike is held by the Democrat Trade Union (EDDSZ) of those working in the SZEF sector.
The four demands put forward by the League are essential to the Government's withdrawal of the proposal for health insurance reform and to allow a new concept for social debate.
The second claim is to gradually introduce the new method of calculating pensions due from next year.
The third is to ensure that early retirement is provided before 2010 with the possibility of entering into the scheme for decent working hours.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Free Trade Association of Railway Workers belonging to the League Trade Union (VDSZSZ) does not accept the offer of railway lines by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport.
Political Capital: the Hungarian Guard raised the country's risk
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded in August of this year with the support of the Jobbik Hungary Movement, increased the political risk of Hungary and the region, according to the Political Capital Risk Analysis Division.
In the company's "risk warning", it is said that the greatest political risk for the activities of the Hungarian Guard is that "the already existing ethnic tension between the Gypsy and the non-Gypsy population in Hungary could result in violent ethnic clashes in the short term".
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely to be aimed at provokeing such an act, the research institute added.
As it has been written, all this is due to one of the main omissions of the Hungarian political actors: "the public debate on Roma has been passed on by public actors to representatives of radical and extreme political groupings, who could build a political strategy against Gypsy-Hungarianism".
This deepens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens the extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - it is believed.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activities of the Hungarian Guard have contributed to a significant deterioration of the image of Hungary abroad, particularly in terms of its belief in the stability and democratic development of the country.
It is recalled that from autumn 2006 onwards, as part of the reorganization of radical and far-right groups in Hungary, the organisation calling itself "national self-defence" was formed in Hungary.
"The common aspect of these concentrations is that they define themselves as civil society organisations, while they openly declare their members - whether armed - to prepare themselves for defence (catastropheit, national defence, law enforcement) tasks, and the police, on the grounds of the inability of the army, that is, the state".
It was noted that this is done in accordance with the method of putting various political aspirations into civil action based on the political and parallel nature of society.
The emphasis on civil society and the form of association are therefore not only intended to avoid the legal failings of court registration for these associations, but also to avoid a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-enhancing factor for the neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been referred to as a potential threat in several neighbouring countries, while the ultranationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the establishment of the Hungarian Guard.
This has an impact on the political stability of the region".
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Central Europe, so political risks have increased throughout the region.
As it was written, the operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union for the Right of the Front (BNU).
In the context of the formation of the Bulgarian Gárda, there are mass Roma disturbances that occurred in one quarter of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU decided to use this to establish a barrier, saying that the purpose of the organization is "national self-defence".
In the past 17 years, they have said that there has been a 'gang terrorism' in Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent - reminds the Political Capital.
They added: the initiative has created a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public.
As it has been said, the increase in the risk of ethnic conflicts indicates that some Roma organisations in Bulgaria have announced that resistance is likely to create their own garden.
Since the functioning of the Hungarian Guard has similarities with the functioning of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Roma in Hungary, by organising their own defence, respond to the threat, can be read in the Political Capital's risk warning.
Attila Juhász, Director of Research at Political Capital, said to the interest of the telepathic office: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they publish their risk analysis annually, and if they experience anything that could affect the risk change, they will inform the public, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
The holiday isn't all red.
In Hungary, the law accurately marks the red-letter days, and around the holidays the workday adjustment has become a general practice, which will be fewer next year.
The EU and America do not have a single holiday.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and state holidays and holidays.
Working days are mostly linked to church holidays, famous historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: both the last and the new first days of the year - the latter is for the New Year's Eves to rest themselves.
All year long, we have a total of eleven red-written holidays.
The National Festival is also the Memorial Day of the Revolution of 1956, which will remember the revolution of 1848.
On the 20th of August we celebrate the state formation, on the 1st of May we celebrate the work, and on the 1st and 2nd of November we remember our relatives and friends who died.
In addition, we have a two-day celebration of Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Since our public, national or religious holidays are rarely scheduled to fall for the weekend, it has become a practice to relocate working days in cases where we would only work one day before or after the red-written holiday.
True, the price for extended weekends is that we don't stay away from work-school on previous Saturdays.
The fact that the day immediately preceding or after the holiday is to be worked out is regulated by the Minister of Labour for many years by a separate regulation.
The legislation covers all employers and their employees, civil servants and civil servants.
However, it does not affect uninterrupted operators and, at its intended end, service companies and institutions operating on rest days.
This year only around the end of the year, the work schedule is changed: from December 24th to December, life will stop in the country, as it has been seen that the majority of the days between Christmas and New Year will either "switch" or use their saved freedom for this purpose.
Next year, more of our holidays will fall in the middle of the week or the end, so there will be less workday relocation than this year.
First, the calendar changes around the festivities so that workers can stay at home for four days at the same time.
The Saturday, 26 April, will be a Saturday, in exchange for the Friday, 2 May rest day.
The second transfer is linked to the festival on 23 October: on 18 October, you will have to work instead of the 24th Friday.
However, the end of the year can take place entirely next year, as from December 24, there will be a nonstop holiday, even if New Year's Eve falls on Wednesday.
Six hideous little things to piss off your colleagues
E-mails, which we forget to send, voice mails, which we never get, are innocent lies that we almost never notice: they "color" the workdays.
Question is, are you accustomed to minor inconveniences or wear gloves and consciously avoid misunderstandings that cause revenge to others?
Tips.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you they were looking for you at the marketing department," says one of your colleagues.
That you missed a meeting?
In the best case you regret and try to make it up to you, you may call the marketing class to tell you that you forgot to deliver the message (this is a less common solution).
Most of the time it's done with an apology.
Before an awkward excuse is made, you should consider what it is you can do to make unpleasant moments for your colleagues and consciously strive to avoid it.
Can you borrow something that's not yours?
There's nothing more annoying than touching a document, office, or your phone, and it's nowhere.
Remember you put your lighter on the table yesterday, but his foot was on the table by morning?
Maybe you can find your lost pen on one of your colleagues' desks?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking, because they will rightly be angry at you for horseing their property.
Don't put me in the pocket from office envelopes, post-it, 'cause it might be uncomfortable if you're running out of time, and you need it right away.
Are you gossiping about the privacy of your colleagues?
There is no good way to stop the rumors that are already spreading.
Who, who, what did you do?
Where and why?
Don't tie your information about your colleagues' privacy to everyone's noses.
If one of them shares his best secrets with you, don't take back his trust.
Bury the heard in yourself, and do not negotiate with your colleagues in your absence, even if others know about the things your colleague has done.
Are you an unprovoked patient?
When you call in the office and report to a patient who has a stomachache, because you feel bad or you feel like you'd rather rest that day; think of your job, your incessant work, your time-limits, and your work must be done by someone else instead of you.
Don't fuck with your colleagues.
If you know in advance that the next day you're not going to go to the office, or there's something you need to stay at home for, tell them that your colleagues and your boss aren't going to face your lack the next day.
Snoring, whining, calling
Did you get involved in the job, but it really drag you out of your co-workers' noise?
Have you become an unwitting ear witness to a telephone conversation that would never have been better to hear?
Do not disturb your colleagues with sulking, singing, loud talk (which you continue above their heads) or footing, constant defamation, loud dissatisfaction.
They can all be confusing, even if they don't get deeper into a project (in writing, design, organisation).
Are you blaming others for mistakes?
If you don't have time, you forgot to send me an important letter, a message, and don't blame me for your forgetfulness.
Don't refer to the possible chaos in your office, your loud colleagues.
Admit it if you've made a mistake, and it's a disadvantage to someone else, and get rid of it.
Ask him how you could make up for your mistake, make up for failure.
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Pants and slippers: comfortable wear at home, but not suitable for the office!
Don't wear a comfortable free-time suit if your job allows you.
Don't be smug, your colleagues, and respect yourself by wearing a regular dress - if your job requires you to go to the office pretty, elegantly.
If you want to answer, you're no longer interesting.
Abrasions with the car in the usual breakfast traffic.
There's a special melody on the radio, the sound of a violin associated with electronic effects.
I'll roll the volume up.
The music has changed pace and the bass arrives next to the earlier sounds, and then the female chorus is connected as real jewelry.
Zagar Wings of Love is on Mr.
Our domestic music life has long been very hard on us with high-quality electronic pops.
But now it looks like the traffic is quite different if you listen to the new Zagar record.
Yonderboi's appearance, some new and exciting productions coming out of the Hungarian digital underground will slowly change the overall picture, and even though the fashion of the guitar-creating garage rock, the Hungarian electropop will prove that there is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started off from Pécs, and you played in Yonderboi's band until, perhaps, two horns didn't go on their own trip.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, which combines the elements of jazz, electronic dance music, pop, but began to break through when film soundtracks were requested to be made available (e.g.
Turkish Ferenc Season).
The compositions of the early smaller clubs were known by the wider audience when the Wan2 magazine listed their first album in 2002 as the 50 most important Hungarian albums, and she called Zagar, in Yonderboi's company, to the almost sole Hungarian marketable Hungarian trendmakers in the West.
No doubt, Zagar and the orchestra have become "trend", but no one asked them if they would like to wear the label.
The orchestra reacted as it had to: made a new, better album.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open up new paths for them, although the title itself wishes to create continuity with the early years of Pécs.
This was one of the lines of the old orchestra of Balázs Zságer.
We'd be on the spot with an aerial, flying reference, but along with the airliness of music, we've now noticed - according to the spirit and trend of the age - the impact of the louder guitar, the rock and roll.
In these songs, George Ligeti, who is currently working with The Puzzle band in England, presented himself at the premiere of the album.
The album also produced a real radio hitter, and Mr. 2 Petőfi, who played popular music from the other morning to the evening, began to smuggle into the ears the songs of Wings of Love recorded with the six Hungarian singers ("underground Divas").
So everything is fine (?).
The avg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit will now ask the question: How much music do you have left to play?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of layer music does not mean much to me.
I think there are two types of light music casts; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
The so-called alternative underground music can be flat, unspeakable, and can do the same thing simply for sale, which makes them commercial.
But it can be caused by sincere motives with a good pop.
The host attitude also works in this spirit regardless of language and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to music?
Zs.B.: In foreign countries, mostly west of us, light music has bigger traditions.
It's not just the 19-year-olds who go to concerts there, it's also the older ones.
They are more likely to monitor the changes in light music around them, as they are also considered part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course, it feels good to have more and more to go to our concerts.
But we never made music on the market.
We don't have music for purpose. We have music for some reason.
The role of the audience can be seen more in concerts where the effect is already on each other, but it is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
Yet, I noticed that if you want to respond to the audience, then you're no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How much do you plan to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He's working solo, and he's built his career west of us.
Zs.B.: We don’t really go his way, regardless of sometimes trying to explain it to our music.
We're more of a team player who trusts in the other music and lets it develop.
At first, of course, it was inevitable that our works were compared to Yonderboi’s music, since many of us had left his orchestra and started on another road.
vg.hu: On the top list of Mr2 Petőfi, Wings of Love has become the first place.
Many first heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Have you deliberately opened up the most popular style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't have a plan to write a hit and sell it.
This song is about more than that.
We were meant to be the finale of the album, which we tried to unlock the sound and difficult subjects on the disk until then.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why them - what was the guiding principle?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel-like choir.
That's when we came up with the idea of making this choir out of the soundful soloists of our own home music scene.
This is how the six-piece choir, Sena, Kutzora Edina, Jude Jay, Peterfy Bori, Hodosi Enikő [Neo], Németh Juci, was formed, and we were then baptized under the name Underround Divas.
hvg.hu: Was the song designed or shaped by the girls?
Zs.B.: The number has long existed in an instrumental version, and then when the disk was assembled, we thought we needed something else for this number.
The chord was attracted to making me sing.
That night I sang the melody that the girls later learned.
It was almost first and scaryly spontaneous.
I remember she was very excited back then, but of course she needed the Divas.
With my voice, it wouldn't have worked that hard.
vg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert seemed to be in the background of the girls.
No solo (except Judy Jay's short solo), they don't have their own roles, they sing all together and they're not louder than music, so music doesn't just follow their songs.
They were backstage.
Is that deliberate?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were standing in the back was merely because of technical problems.
But it is conscious that we did not want to share solo roles.
The number is also about forgetting our ego for a little while where he came from, just letting those certain wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which was the most work with?
Zs.B.: In fact, none of the musical creative processes were more difficult than mixing.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play in a race piano, or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work for long, and then slowly everything stood in place like a puzzle game.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song about the new disc?
Zs.B.: This is always changing with the concert and I've already released the record.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The traitor was risking billions because of a sense of inferiority.
It's an infidel scream.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, French Société Générale, calls his former employee Jerome Kerviel.
Because of Kerviel, he lost almost five billion euros.
However, it seems that Kerviel was not a talentless player at all, but he was just a great player to catch up with his colleagues.
Unlike other banks, he recognised the crisis of the American mortgage market in time.
"Depleted mental capacity," he said from the police notifying superiors.
However, as reported by the French producer Le Monde, Kerviel's statement shows that at the end of last year, he made a profit of EUR 1.6 billion.
Not only in America, but also in the United States
"I just wanted to make money for my bank," he claims in his statement.
In summer, he managed to make half a billion euros in the US crisis.
He felt the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
There have been news in February that there will be problems with so-called subprime mortgage for low-income customers or clients with past repayment problems.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe in it and put me on a good horse.
The year-end profits reached EUR 1.6 billion.
"When I was looking for the first half billion, I didn't know how to announce it," he admits Kerviel and adds that he didn't keep anything for himself.
In his confession, he admits that he forged his reports so that it could not be discovered.
He was also able to fool his superiors, even when the Eurex stock exchange was also interested in his transactions.
Profit for risk
Were you afraid of finding out?
I'd rather not.
"I thought only the fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank would calm them down."
Where did he have the will to take such a risk?
He has achieved his position gradually.
After completing the university in London, he worked at Société Générale Bank since 2000.
His annual salary moved around $51,000.
Two years later, he was a broker and became an independent broker with a payment of $90,000 a year in 2005.
Nevertheless, he knew that he would never make as much money as others.
"In 2005, during my first conversation, I knew they were looking at me wrong.
Because of my qualifications, professional and personal development," Kerviel told the detectives.
Not long after he entered, the first great success came.
He was searching for the shares of Allianz, as during the bombings in London, he put EUR half a billion on the fall of these shares.
And that started the avalanche - he wanted more.
As long as you're here, we'll leave you alone.
"This is like a snowball," he told the police.
But his superiors said they knew everything, or rather suspected.
"As long as I was looking for money, they're dead."
But there was a blow at the beginning of the year.
He lost a billion euros in one day.
He wanted to cover it up in the middle of January a weekend.
When he started working on Monday, he didn't work at the bank anymore.
And the bank announced a few days later that it lost five billion euros.
And how did they find out?
His freedom made him suspicious.
"I've only taken four days in the last year.
The broker who doesn't have freedom is a broker who doesn't want anyone to look at his reports," Kerviel finished.
It is possible to acquire 365 billion Czech Republic
Ministers of the Czech Government and representatives of the European Commission signed nine operational programmes, of which the Czech Republic could obtain EUR 14 billion in the coming years (approx. 365 billion).
It is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
For regions, seven operational programmes cost about 125 billion kroons.
Czech companies will be able to obtain an amount of around EEK 100 billion from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most money, 150 billion kroons, is for transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operating programme and accounts for 22% of the funds available to the Czech Republic.
These funds will increase the state fund of the Transport Infrastructure, which will continue to grow by HUF 90.8 billion in the future.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme helps entrepreneurs and companies to win assets for innovation enterprises.
Companies should also provide resources for the introduction of new technologies, industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is among the least successful in winning funds from the EU funds in the new countries.
The court approved the 20-year prison sentence of the ex-president of Nicaragua
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal issued a 20-year prison sentence for Arnold Alemán, the former President of the country, for financial fraud of USD 100 million (nearly kroons of 1.8 billion) in 2003.
Later, however, he was released from prison and was under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital.
The fact that the former head of this Central American country from 1997 to 2002 is back behind bars is not clear, according to the AP News Agency.
According to Ileana Perez, the President of the Court of Appeal will depend on the warden's leadership to leave Aleman's punishment at home or return to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Alemán that government money was regularly referring to foreign company accounts in Panama.
These fictitious companies and their account numbers actually belonged to relatives and their closest supporters.
Some of these funds were then made at the Foundation, which was based on the financing of Alemán's 2001 election campaign.
Our budget has been approved
That's right.
They accepted the state budget.
What makes this budget special?
This is the first budget, adopted by a coalition majority, without the support of the opposition, drawn up by this government.
This year, with the support of the Social Democrats, was passed last year because Minister Sobotka and the Czech Social Democratic Party were not allowed to accept the non-acceptance.
Unlike the conflict of confidence in the government before the vote, there has been no drama this time.
The House of Representatives has generally ignored this law, although it is the most influential law.
It's a certain contradiction.
Each governance starts and ends with each chapter and item of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of politics, but it is hidden behind the forces of the government and the opposition.
This is more grateful to the press, which is why you get much more attention in the media.
The debates of politicians are much more interesting to the public than mere numbers.
The public budgets of the social-democratic governments in the past have faced three shortcomings which the 2008 budget cannot solve at the same time:
The first is the high proportion of the mandatory 'responsible' expenditure law, which means not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved last year by ČSSD and KSČM's silent 'colation' before the elections.
The second is the result of the first deficiency in the management of deficits.
The third limit is the deficits of public funding, i.e. the deficits of the budgets of cities and walks.
However, the highest risk is not the deficit of the public budget.
This is public and relatively controlled.
Timed bombs are the budget deficits of cities and walks.
A number of mayors can also make money for investments other than money from taxes, taxes and bank loans, and have often issued unmistakably bonds with which their city buildings are disproportionately encumbered.
In recent years, these debts have been repaid by the massive sale of the shares in the energy and other distribution networks which the State has received from the privatisations.
They don't have that source anymore.
If we rely only on official and verifiable facts, we shall determine that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a growth phase with which the Czech Social Democratic Party is constantly praising.
This was a unique opportunity for its governments to restructure public funding.
Instead, the country was increasingly deleveraged into debt.
The other countries, with two exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more rationally than the Czech Republic.
This is primarily the great shame of the former governments.
We belong to the countries that are least threatened by poverty in global terms.
That is why, for example, there is no need for huge social programmes, which, unfortunately, have just over the last few years been grown to a giant size completely unnecessary.
Although this year we have managed to eliminate part of the pointless populistic expenditure approved before the elections, even if there is no soon-to-be-out of retirement and pension reform, any policy in this country will actually end, and whoever it is to govern, this will only be an omnipotent.
A little too much is said that the majority of the money paid by the governor politicians are usually retired and that social benefits become their mechanical distributions.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but can only stop it from being cut off by the responsible expenditure of normal expenditure.
The 70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be totally unnecessary if the former governments had not lost everything that could have been spent in the last decade.
If we do not want it to really happen to become mere officials of the governing politicians, then we must be patient and we must wish peace in the preparation of further reform laws for this strong, well-known coalition government, that the state can only pay as much as it can obtain from taxes and taxes.
Only these will allow a balanced budget to be achieved gradually.
Member of the Commission
The banks want to solve the crisis
The central banks of the US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
Money markets are thus costing over $100 billion through the stock exchange.
On this stock exchange, interest rates are raised on the bank, for which money is ready to be borrowed.
For example, the U.S. Fed puts $40 billion on the stock exchange and makes another $24 million available to the European and Swiss central bank.
After the eleventh attacks of September, it is for the first time that the central banks of each country have agreed on a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step should address the main problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," wrote to their clients in their report by Bernard Baumohl, the Economic Outlook Group Advisory Company.
"The coordinated action of central banks in the United States reduced the likelihood of recession from 65% to about 50 percent," said Baumohl in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion, mainly in the United States, due to unpaid loans.
Analysts expect another billion more losses.
"Central banks can really be afraid of what might happen if they decided on such a procedure," said Kieran Davies, the chief economist of ABN Amro.
It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks fear that if the banks themselves have difficulty accessing the loans, they will be more expensive to lend to their clients.
This would reduce the need and put the American economy into recession with possible consequences for the global economic growth.
The central banks have decided not to achieve a reduction in the so-called LIBOR, the interbank interest rate in London, which is used to borrow money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of mutual money lending, even though the central banks of the United States, Canada and Great Britain also reduced their interest rates a few times during the autumn.
"There will be a similar effect to this further reduction in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio, Reuters news agency, from Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the steps taken by central banks contribute to the resolution of the crisis, as it does not solve the basic problem, the fall of the American real estate market.
Klaus: Unbelievably debated by ecologists
Global climate change poses the greatest threat to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again gave an opinion on the problem of global warming.
This time, he criticised the UN Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
The book Blue presented in Vienna, not the green planet, has made it clear that the debates of ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which is a special mixture of governments and civil society representatives, but also a fundamental difference between the rhetoric and reality that accompanys it.
"The debate there absolutely lacks the structure, it's just a waste of words, which are a substitute for solving the current problems," Klaus said.
During the presentation of the Czech President's book, he stressed that his topic was very important to him, and that is why he was so committed to this subject.
He expressed his satisfaction that the book would also appear in German translation, because, as he said, "I often only meet the cartoons of my opinion".
So now the interest can read its undistorted opinion.
Klaus recalled that although he was not a climatologist, he believed that he had sufficient basics to write such a book on condition.
Because of its ability to monitor and judge professional meetings, he has been experienced as academics in statistics and economists as well.
In conclusion, the book indicated that the climate is constantly changing, i.e. its changes are normal, and not all scientists agree that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and too serious, so there is no danger, and the efforts to influence climate change are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptablely costly.
In addition, he considers it unacceptable to exert unconfirmed opinions on others as an experienced person of totalitarianism, which he considers to be a dangerous restriction of freedom.
To the questions of those present, he repeatedly explained that "it is not against the reasonable protection of the environment, but against the militant enviromentism, which does not take account of the relationship between costs and benefits".
Klaus talked about a similar subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand could not exchange their licenses
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and were unable to change their old licence in time, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day that they can still apply for an exchange so that the agencies can issue the new licence by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that, after the new year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will take off without valid entitlement.
According to the agencies, the license was not replaced primarily by those who no longer want to drive.
While the abuses represent a severe fall in interest in licence exchanges, the capital offices have been flooded with licence exchanges applications for which interest has increased this week.
The Mayor's Office receives about 2,000 customers a day.
It's about half an hour in line.
In Prague, the license was not replaced by about 140,000 drivers.
It takes 20 days to issue a new licence.
However, the new licence may be requested by a reduced period of five days.
However, in such a case, the driver must pay an additional 500 kroner.
Drivers who are unable to complete the obligation to exchange licences by the end of the year and are entitled to an invalid right shall be subject to penalties from January onwards.
The guilty person must pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police may also settle the case by means of an agreement.
In the event of administrative failure, the penalty shall be EEK 2500.
Based on earlier information from the town hall, you can also receive a fine for someone who does not travel anywhere.
They say he can pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has previously called on the agencies to be despicable and up to a thousand crowns of punishment.
According to the Minister of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, tens of thousands of fines do not threaten anyone.
According to him, a license is a document where people can decide whether or not to.
This is not a identity card that should be valid for everyone.
Those who no longer want to drive should give up their license.
It's enough to take it or recommend it's delivered by mail to the appropriate office.
At the end of the year, licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will no longer be valid.
However, drivers must gradually replace other types of licence.
Those holding documents between 1994 and 2000 can be replaced for another three years.
The validity of licences issued between 2001 and 2004 will expire only in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the punishment of the police officers associated with Berdycche.
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňałík, who are suspected of working together with David Berdych's crime association, were sentenced to 13 and 10 years of imprisonment.
Of this, the Supreme Court of Prague has a decisive effect, which has reduced their penalties to one of them for two years.
Detectives in the Prague Department of Crime were originally threatened by a 14 and 12-year-old prison.
Today's decision cannot be appealed against; the review can only be applied to the Supreme Court.
Although Berdyche is also suspected in this case, he is only awaiting a first-rate conviction.
In other proceedings, more than 16 years have already been punished.
You can't have it anymore.
In January, the County Court mainly found 19 persons guilty of acts of robbery, of which 16 were heard today by the Supreme Court.
Most of the defendants rejected the accusations from the beginning of the investigation by rejecting speculation.
According to the Senate in Central Czech Republic, after the deal with Berdycche, the police forces provided information from police sources, covered each robbery and helped the gang avoid being held responsible.
So the gang gave the robbery 30 percent of the robbery to Opava and Koňařík.
The charges refer to gang crimes between 1999 and 2001.
First and foremost, we are dealing with robberies that have often suffered serious health damage, but also abuse of the authority of a civil servant and illicit possession of weapons.
Because the police found illegal weapons, steel-core bullets, lasers or machine guns in search of the house.
The gang is accused of looting tens of millions of crowns.
In the course of this procedure, the courts have already declared the twenty-member gangs legally guilty of other robberies in Berdych and many others.
Other members of the Berdych's environment testify before the court even in other proceedings, some cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The first-level trial has so far avoided Tomáš Puta and Maroš Šulej, who are in custody in Ireland, awaiting a final decision on their delivery to the Czech Republic for criminal proceedings.
Account for child exchange: 12 million
Igor Veleba, the lawyer of damaged families for children who have been changed from the hospital to the hospital in Třebíč, will require 12 million kroons of pain, plus the costs of the court.
Three million each for mothers, two million for fathers and a million for children.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 per parent.
The hospital's legal representative, Ondřej Dostal, disagrees essentially with his proposal to him.
"We reject such a claim because it is too much," said Dostal after today's trial.
"In order to obtain an opinion on the counter proposal, we need the expert opinion drawn up by the opponent.
We'll figure out if there's any useful value.
But we maintain our opinion that this will be measurable for everyone in hundreds of thousands," said Dostal.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for the four parents.
At the start of the case, the family in Jabloňov wanted a million crowns for every month until he raised their own biological daughter.
Veleba served as the basis for the award negotiations with experts, which was developed by the Motol University Hospital in Prague.
Children’s parents, according to psychologists and psychiatrists, suffered various degrees of emotional damage and stress.
The stress situation was more tolerated by men, even if they had met with such a feeling that they did not prevent the exchange of newborns.
Women are worse off dealing with the currentness of the trauma they experienced and what is happening right now, she's been able to capture the contents with him.
Veronika and Nikolaa were replaced by nurses in the birthplace of Třebíč on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their birth parents - Nikola Čermák in Přibyslavic, Veronika Libor Brož and Jaroslava in Trojanova Jabloňov.
At the end of October, Mr Miloš Vystrčil, Vysočina's head of staff, gave families $100,000 to compensate for their expenses, which were due to the error of the hospital in Těebíčské, which is managed by the procedure.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic have compulsory insurance under the law.
In the event of a mistake, they must extend to the reserve fund and, exceptionally, they may request the founder's assistance.
Until now, the courts have approved relatively low compensation for people, and the amounts have been calculated on the basis of a few hundred thousand, exceptionally a few million crown tables.
Políka lost her kingdom of Véasko
Bolek Políka lost his lawsuit for the kingdom of Véissko.
According to the Ostrava Court judge, although he first used the name velach, the project was developed by a team around the actor Tomáš Harabiš with many years of work.
Políka didn't attend the trial today.
However, according to his legal representative, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The debate is about Mr. Harabiš and his team living in the popularity of Bolek Pollíka," said Políka's lawyer after the trial.
He thinks that with the words of the kingdom of Valachi, everyone will be remembered by the actor-comicist.
This opinion is shared by Harabiš.
"We've got ten years of work behind us.
To find the money and figure out the actions," he said.
He thinks the reason for the debate is money.
"In the end of the year, they realized that the project was successful and that they could win something.
They want to live from our work," he said.
Profitability, cash flow, investments and return on investments
According to the court, the King of Valachi first used his name on a television show.
In 1993 he was crowned by Radoslav Brzobohatý.
At that time, however, this did not relate to the purpose of building a physical kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing the vanachi passports.
The original student coup has become a business and profitable entrepreneurship, on which Harabiš founded the creation of a society of the Kingdom of Véssko.
In 1997, he agreed to state his name and signature in passports and even offered discounts to their owners when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who takes the throne?
The judge also mentioned today that Harabiš himself was only using the idea, which Polívka made public in Maness for his business.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka has certainly helped the project of the Kingdom of Valachi," said the judge.
However, he added that the project's spirit was Harabiš and his team.
The cooperation of today's parties continued until 2000 when Harabiš Polík organized an official coronation in Vsetín.
Since then, however, there have been discussions between Políka and Harabiš which have been clinched in the release of "King Boleslav, who has been elected forever".
In the Kingdom, the leader took over Jarmila Šulakova as Queen of Mothers at Harabiš' initiative.
In 2002 the court brought legal action against Pollíka Harabiš and his associates, which the court today rejected.
The fight designed by Harabiš could bring light to the debate for the throne and for the Queen's half.
This fight should be a new king.
He didn't want to tell me the details and the time.
"We don't want to catch anything.
This is supposed to be something like a Slovacko royal procession.
The king should be chosen for a fixed period of time.
Mr Políka can apply for peace of mind," said Harabiš.
The 207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot test: excellent prejudices
Honestly, I never liked Peugeot 206.
Mine's properties are nothing special, the quality of the change, driving and production are often referred to as below average.
But the successor to the market is already present, Peugeot 207 is significantly better.
And the combination called SW goes a little further, so I have no choice but to think.
When I tested Peugeot 207's classic Hatchback, for example, I complained in the back seat to the head.
This time, the complaint is over, because the arms of the combustible means that, in this regard, no longer the two-meter-high giants suffer.
Fluffy in the World
I'll get through the interior soon so I don't repeat myself many times.
It is a relatively successful design, where I have the only excuse for poor console.
I'd appreciate a little more designer inventory here, since the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and where are the times when we complained about the short lower part of the seat or arms.
Side management has also improved significantly against model 206.
As far as space is concerned, there is also an increase in the size of the bodywork.
In the combination, the head disappears from the above mentioned few places.
I'll be in the trunk.
The main part of this vehicle is therefore the packaging space.
I have to assess this as very well available (even thanks to the flip-off rear window) and as spacious.
The empty spaces are equipped with safety tires, which are ideal for compromises.
They're not in the way, they can be pulled apart, and they can handle things that are harder.
But let's just stay at the volume for a while.
This is based on the tables of the Fund's arrangement of 428 L, which is more of an average value than competition.
However, in the Czech Republic it is not the most wanted vehicle in this class - against Skoda Fabia Combi.
If you compare 207 SW to the new generation of Mladá boleslav, you will find that Peugeot is well behind a large number of 52 litres.
This value is almost critical when you are on a foreign holiday or put in a baby car.
But if I have to highlight the positives, then I still have to mention the almost straight floor after pulling down the second-row backrest or the very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
The car tested by us was equipped with a four-cylinder lighter with a volume of 1.6 l, with a power of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, it should look like a thousand-six-thousand running the family hatback.
It's quiet, it's low-use, and it's pulling.
If we compare it to Škoda's match, which often affects as if they were filling rags in his exhaust, I can only be happy about that.
It's a good price.
Car prices are not cheap.
However, we must remember that we have tested a car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The car is still leaving for 329 900 Kč with four-wheeled alien engines.
The car starts with 410 990 Kč, which is quite a lot.
The tested Premium equipment throws the equipment with an additional 80,000 Kč.
Except for us even our head airbags, our automatic climate, our automatic window wiper start, our back windows were electric remote control...
Which means the car will cost you 531 900 Kč.
This is a lot, but calculate the Fabia additional equipment and get very similar results.
So there's nothing left to do but make the decision next to the brand.
Integration of Slovak students in British schools failed
In British schools, there are more and more children in Eastern Europe who are worrying about the further development of local school affairs.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans is currently facing a number of obstacles.
British schools have already registered cases of violence between children of immigrants and domestic residents.
The problems of the integration of children in eastern Europe are well illustrated by a case in the north-east, where discussions between their seats and Slovakian immigrants are increasing.
Fighting and bonding between students are already a characteristic of parents’ relationships.
The situation has come to an end that in Chatham, the police have arrested a Slovak woman who said a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The guilty person is defending the boy from insulting him with racist secret.
The police had to act after two twelve-year-old girls attacked Slovakian immigrants.
The girls claimed to have made racist remarks and tossed him with stones.
"When we were on our way home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told her to stop doing this, she hit us with apples and pears and then exposed her naked ass," said the Slovak students' mother of another unpleasant case for The Times.
Both sides have complaints.
One of the local residents considered the debate on Eastern European immigrants to be a survival struggle.
The above cases suggest that in British schools the atmosphere between locals and immigrants is becoming tense.
In Great Britain, there are 70,000 Slovaks looking for jobs.
About 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is indeed an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it can be fulfilled if you answer correctly.
The gold horse and white beaches, high waves, or sea, calm as a fisher.
Palm trees and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream or mortar cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
You can find this in a full and richer list in the Caribbean islands.
However, you can find much more on an island, and this is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Great Antiguas.
Under the Spaniards, Cuba was a wuss of their American conquests.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place that human eyes have ever seen.
Havana has become a treasure store and a transhipment facility, which the Spaniards have taken in America and transported to Europe.
Then the American era followed.
The Nacional Hotel was built in the late 20s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the chiefs of the American Mafia, was built because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (primarily estilation), was welcomed in Cuba and supported drugs, gambling, prostitution.
For example, they were amongst their guests.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tower houses were built, cars that became a cult symbol of the 50s of the past century on the broad roads.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and had his own yacht in Cojímar.
The Bodeguita del Medio walls are decorated with the signatures of the American show business stars and politicians.
And today?
You can serve the Havana Bodeguita wall with your handkerchief.
The expensive Nacional Hotel bar will mix a cocktail for you.
And the cars of the cult of the '50s are still in Havana, because once exported, they've been rotting away in salt and wet air.
Although the oldest part of Havana is greatly rested, there is no more beautiful colonial monument anywhere else in the area than there is.
Other places are becoming more beautiful, like Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism provides the money that is needed, its development has been greened.
In the last 15 years, new hotels were built not only in Havana, but also in Varader, on the coast of Holguín province and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers a unique taste in the world, which is first and foremost appreciated by train fans.
Out of their extensive plantations, sugar cane was transported to sugar plants by steam and engine trains.
Their motor park was not renewed for decades, so the machines that operate there are visible, which are only visible in museums elsewhere.
Where should we go?
Most of Cuba’s visitors do not avoid the best known places.
So Varader or Havana doesn't have to be written too much.
Perhaps we should simply remind you that there is a museum on the Hemingway Births already mentioned, and that anyone who loves the writer does not need to miss a visit to this museum.
One of the most picturesque parts of Viňales Valley Cuba in the western part of the island.
The lush vegetation is growing out of a massacre.
Stone formations, haystacks and rocks are rising steeply from the bottom of the valley and a fertile soil is gathered in their wells, which also gives the gravel spread a dense vegetation.
The valley is a place where tobacco of the highest quality may be produced in Cuba.
Its final form may be met at the visit of one of the cigar production plants in Havana.
Some may also find it interesting that there was an episode of Major Zeman's Chilean episode.
Trinidad
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish island colonization.
The slave and sugar trade brought fame and glory.
The economy is a body in the beauty and monumental nature of a non-great city.
The later French settlers had a significant impact on the colonial Spanish architecture in almost four centuries.
The place between the Escambray plain and the sea is so remote that even in the 50s of the last century there were no roads that would link this country to the rest of the country.
That certain isolation helped keep an outsider.
They didn't build anything there, so they didn't break it, everyone was happy that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than an afternoon to go to Trinidad, it's worth looking at the interesting places in the area like the Playa Ancón coast or the Sugar Factory Valley.
In the evening, it is appropriate to go to the Casa de la Música, which will wake up after dark, where music will be quiet only in the morning.
Baracoa
Some people regard the town in the eastern part of Cuba as the most beautiful city.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the path itself.
Both routes from Guantanamo have to combat high and desolate mountains, and they lead through the nature of human activity that is almost barely affected.
The eastern language of Cuba was added to the World Heritage List by UNESCO, thanks to its unspoiled nature.
This is where the best chocolate is made, the church has a Columbus cross (in reality made hundreds of years after Columbus's sailing) and the hill, where the former castle stood and today the El Castillo Hotel stands, there are some of the most famous tables, of which the El Yunque is the most famous.
The coffee, rum, cigars, Sierra Mestro plains, the Gulf of Disk and the Island of Isla de Pinos, the Cabaret of Tropicana, the Holy Caridad del Cobra Cuba, Santeria, the religion of Africa, which is recognised by the descendants of former slaves, there is much to be written about.
I mean, as they say correctly, it's better to see it once.
The Afghan allies are passive, claimed by the Americans.
Few soldiers and lack of necessary equipment also affect the progress of the United States mission in Afghanistan.
According to Robert Gates, NATO should draw up concrete plans for the coming years.
The Afghanistan mission is not supposed to take place, but has agreed on the leaders of countries in Edinburgh, Scotland, with units located in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the increasing resistance of the Taliban movement, eight participating countries are also discussing further plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States, with the involvement of the Secretary of Defence Robert Gates, called for more activity this week, the United Kingdom considers the strengthening of the Afghan government and the strengthening of development aid as a priority.
"The development of Afghanistan is tangible, but the military force is only part of the solution.
The other allowed the population to start further development of the economy and security themselves," said the British Minister of Defence Des Browne to the BBC.
Ninety percent
According to the U.S. government, the activity of Afghan rebels has been the strongest in the last five years.
The number of violent acts increased by 27 per cent compared to last year and by 60 per cent in Helmand South.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the south.
According to the United States, however, allies have reached their borders in the organization and equipment of the troops.
They specifically requested additional helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We need to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and ways to achieve them," , Mr Gates.
He spoke in a similar spirit today to the Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop.
"I'm not happy about what's going on in Afghanistan in the ground and in the air.
We have about 90 percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and this is little," said De Hoop to the Reuters News Agency at the end of the three-day conversation with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who Passive
Among the participating countries, there are also discussions over recent months on whether all the allies will provide the maximum level in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticised for its passiveness.
"The Germans are relatively present in Afghanistan.
However, they were introduced in areas where the least of the violence and fighting requirements are not as high against them as they are against us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The Sun British tabloid called the German soldiers lazy this week.
"The Afghan diaries have been exposed: The Germans are playing while our boys are fighting," wrote Sun in the material supplemented by the photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild was in a counterattack and released a photo of a British team's rugbing game in the south of Afghanistan.
Public debt reaches one billion in 2009
Every Czech has 84,000 crowns of state debt.
The total debt reached EEK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
This year, the government is planning to raise a loan of HUF 159.2 billion.
By early December, however, the Ministry reduced this plan by SEK 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of the public budget.
At the end of September, the Czech Republic’s government debt reached the EEK 842.7 billion.
During the nine months of this year, this increased by 40.2 billion kroons.
From June, however, it decreased by 13.4 billion kroons.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed today its government debt data from the beginning of October.
Each Czech has more than 84,000 crowns.
Last year, the state owed more than 11 billion kroons.
"For now, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit next year, we can only cross the one billion crown limit in 2009.
The following year, debt will move around 900 billion and a billion crown," said IHNed.cz server analyst at Patria Finance, David Marek.
Similarly, you can see this analysis of Next Finance, Vladimír Pikora: "We can cross over a billion in the course of 2009.
That, exactly when, the unknown depends on the next budget.
If it were to be proved that the situation in the policy area would change, politicians would be willing to save more, and this could be reversed by 2010.
But I'm not assuming this change," he mentioned.
Increased debt
Public debt is the debt of the central government, which is primarily generated by the accumulation of government deficits.
Public debt is financed by cash tickets, government bonds, direct loans, or, for example, by loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal debt has increased by 38,5 billion this year to 719,4 billion kroons.
The state’s foreign debt has now increased by 1.7 billion to DKK 123.3 billion.
By the end of September, the so-called "saleable government debt" reached 803.3 billion kroons and decreased from June to 13.7 billion kroons.
The average debt-to-GDP ratio rose to 6.5 years.
"During the whole year, debt increased by 13 percent in the first quarter, which is indeed quite a lot compared to economic progress.
It is interesting that the increase is primarily generated by the loan bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It's bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it shows what it's going to be trading when the pension reform is here," Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The funding strategy and the government debt management in 2007 show that the government has planned to raise a loan of HUF 159.2 billion this year.
By early December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan by SEK 152.8 billion due to better development of the public budget.
The amount is primarily the deficit of the public budget, which is likely to reach the estimated kroon of 91.3 billion instead of the EEK 76 billion this year.
In addition, the Czech Consolidation Agency's planned source of a maximum of 13,3 billion kroons, the provision of pensions for a ten billion reserve, the financing of a state loan of 43 billion kroons and the repayment of loans worth 1,8 billion kroons from the European Investment Bank.
The teacher will appear today in the court of Carcoma for the name of a lyss bear.
On Thursday night, a court in Kartúm sentenced the British teacher in Sudan to 15 days in jail and to being expelled from the country because of the violation of Islam, said his lawyer.
The British woman was accused of allowing her students from 6 to 7 years of age to be named Muhammad, but Islamic religion prohibits any representation of her prophet.
Such an act can be punished by coup d'état.
The 54-year-old British woman, who was arrested on Sunday at her own apartment by a teacher at the 1st High School in Kartúm. According to paragraph 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, she was accused of the violation and rebellion of Islam after several complaints were made by the students' parents at the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story began in September when the teacher asked her students from 6 to 7 years of age to choose a name for the class's lyss bear.
"The children suggested eight names: Haszán, Abdullah and Mohammed among them," says Robert Boulos, the school director.
Finally, 20 out of 23 children chose the first name Mohammed.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic prophet, but a very common first name also exists in Sudan.
The children then made a joint diary with the picture of the bear and the "My Name is Mohamed."
The problem lies in the fact that any representation of the prophet is a violation of Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' colleagues at the same school told me that he knew her well, and that the teacher would never do anything that would violate any religious belief. He said it was only a "innocent mistake": "I am sorry that the name was voted with children".
Many of the students of the teacher agree with this belief, they say that the teacher is "very well treated by children" and "never speak of religion in the class".
Let us not forget that the second most popular first name is Mohammed in Great Britain, and there are 14 different methods of writing in English.
This name is so often chosen by Muslim families as a way of expressing the honor of the prophet. (Gyakran receives this name from the first-born child of the family.)
But what rules apply to the use of the first name?
Can this name be given to a game, for example?
It's obviously a matter of interpretation.
There was no agreement at the last Vienna trial on Wednesday on the future status of the province.
The end result: failure.
Without the convergence of the positions, the meeting between the Serbs and the Albanians in Kosovo concluded on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, the last of the sixth and the last of the separatist provinces.
"It is unfortunate that the parties have not reached an agreement on the status," said Wolfgang Ischinger's EU diploma at a Vienna press conference.
The American Ambassador, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace is at stake in the region and encouraged Belgrade and Pristina to keep their promises to maintain peace and dialogue after the negotiations.
"There is no need to be afraid of violence in the near future, but there is a very difficult time," he added, stressing the existence of "serious tensions".
The Mediation Ends on December 10
On Monday, the last visit to Serbia and Kosovo is the European Union, the United States of America and Russia's mediation troika.
The future of the Albanian province can be clarified by Ischinger, Wisner and the Russian mediator, Aleksandr Bocan-Harchenko, by December 10th, the United Nations Security Council.
The meeting in Baden, near Vienna, has been the sixth and last meeting of the negotiations since the UN commissioned the troika with new mediation last August.
The Americans and Europeans believe that their mediation mission will be completed on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already failed Kosovo's independence in the Security Council, insist that negotiations continue after the expiry of the deadline.
"Russia was committed and remains the negotiated solution, in favour of the compromise," said Bocan-Harchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After 8 years of UN leadership in Kosovo, the Western authorities believe that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina said that she was willing to declare herself unilaterally if the Security Council did not decide for her benefit.
Belgrade would continue to support greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not been able to reach an agreement," said the president of Kosovo's independent province, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the hotel in Baden, where there have been "negotiation of last chance" since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo Resurrection and future prime minister of the province, also expressed regret.
He added, however, that Belgrade's idea of autonomy would be "a continuation of a past that would be in the face of murder and deportation".
"Domino Effect"
The Serbian President, Boris Tadic, considered that the compromise was still possible and the majority of the Albanians in Kosovo warned about the consequences of the unilateral proclamation of independence.
Belgrade still fears "domino effect" because of the wars of independence in the nineties in an unstable area.
"This does not exclude the possibility of compromise for Serbia," Tadic said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation once again said that the decision would be solely for the Security Council, where the Russian ally had veto rights.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"For Serbia only the solution approved by the Security Council is acceptable," said the Serbian Prime Minister, Vojislav Kostunica.
"The negotiations have been held for two years.
They must end where they started: in the Security Council".
Fatmir Sejdiu said to the journalists that 'the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word'. He added that the unilateral exclamation of independence by the Albanians will take place on the basis of the "conclusion" with the Western powers.
Bush calls for an agreement between Israel and Palestine
On Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israel and Palestine finally agreed to sign a joint declaration at the opening of an international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland.
According to Bush, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmúd Abbas agreed to enter into negotiations immediately to settle the dispute between their peoples for 60 years.
Bush, in the presence of the two presidents, promised to support them in all possible ways so that they could still sign the "Peace Agreement" in 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians must eliminate the 'terrorist networks' and Israel must abandon its colonial activity, said Bush, and reminded the two parties of their obligations in relation to the "Peace Plan" adopted in 2003.
The Head of the White House stressed that the purpose of the negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and Israel, led by Abbas, was to "sign a peace agreement with which all pending problems, including central issues, will be resolved".
The latter concern the three delicate problems at the heart of the Israeli-Palestin debate: the future borders of Palestine, the position of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees who lived in the territory of today's Israeli state in the course of the conflict in 1948.
After the President of the United States, Abbas maintained that future negotiations should be "global and profound" and cover all areas of regulation, such as "Jerusalem, asylum, borders, colonies, water and security".
Then Olmert, on the stage, promised that future negotiations would be "indirect and continuous" and that he would seek to "end in 2008".
By the end of 2008, Bush set out the achievement of the parallel Palestinian and Israeli 'two-state vision'.
Saudi Arabia said Bush had a promise to do so before deciding to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia (which, with the support of all the Arab countries, has been recorded as a success in Annapolis) has launched a plan that will guarantee peace for Israel if it withdraws from all the Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis "is an answer in the history of the Middle East, especially because it takes the root of the problem and focuses on the central issues", considers the Saudi Prince in his interview with the Saudi daily newspaper.
The D.A. says the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is usually the case with news of this type, the official position and the rumors contradict each other.
How did the accident happen?
According to the first findings of the investigation launched by the General Control Body of the National Police (IGPN), a police car moved on Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Beel after a few minutes.
"The car was on patrol, so he wasn't in action. He was moving 40-50 km/h without sirens," we found out from a police source.
The two without helmets were driven by a "high speed" of green, "not included in the official register, so it cannot be used in road traffic" (see below) with the Kawasaki brand.
"Because they didn't follow the right-hand rule, the engine hit the left side of the police car," says a cop.
The result of the alcohol test on the passengers of the vehicle was negative.
It shows the strength of the impact that the front of the car was rolled in, that the windshield was shattered in the shape of the star, and that the bumper was torn down.
In his extraordinary announcement last morning, Pontoise's State Prosecutor, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, said that he entrusted IGPN and the Val-D'Oise County Public Safety Directorate with the investigation which was launched "for lack of carelessness in manslaughter and help".
During the afternoon, the prosecutor said at a press conference that at the current stage of the investigation of IGPN the responsibility of the police could be ruled out.
According to the prosecutor, three witnesses of the accident on Sunday evening confirmed "the police report that the bomber arrived relatively quickly from the left side of the police car".
Yesterday, from a stripe, which, no doubt, the pedestrians pulled on the roadside, they showed that the two vehicles were stuck together and that they were moving together for a while until the police car was able to contain them.
Vehicles have been booked for technical testing.
The two victims' bodies were subject to medical examination yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Beel, the rumor was that the police quickly left the scene without providing assistance to the two young people.
In this respect, IGPN is cautious, but it excludes the police from making a "any serious mistake".
"This is the hardest part of the investigation, which requires more thorough investigation, and more caution" - we learned from the police source.
Libreation met a witness who reported a few minutes after the accident.
One of the windows of his apartment looks exactly at the scene.
"My cousin, who is a hospital nurse, we immediately went to try to revive them," says the witness.
"There's nothing we could do."
Then he noticed "a cop who was completely disturbed and dejected.
The other two tried to revive one of the young and the fourth called."
The tension among those present has increased, as the hopeless situation of the two young people has become apparent, so the incoming police have driven their colleagues away from the scene by car.
We also know from the witness's report that the ambulance arrived about 20 minutes after the police left.
They also used heart massages, but in vain.
"I wouldn't say the police didn't try to help young people.
Young people have been helped.
The firemen arrived immediately at the scene.
They did their best to save them," the prosecutor stressed.
Stress in Pakistan
On Monday, the Pakistani police prevented the first demonstrations of a state of emergency introduced by General Musarraf two days earlier.
According to witnesses, about two thousand lawyers in the east of Lahore were wounded from the tear gas bombs used by the law enforcement forces against the measures taken during the emergency.
In response, they threw stones at the police, many of whom were injured.
At least 350 lawyers were manufactured.
Similar events took place in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where the police attacked and wounded the lawyers.
They made more people.
In Islam, registered lawyers of the Supreme Court called for a general strike and filed protests for the arrest of some 500 opposition members, human rights fighters and lawyers during the weekend.
On Monday morning, streets to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the gathering.
There were several demonstrations in Multan and the Northwest Peshawar, lying in the centre of the country.
Since Monday, the lawyer movement has also been supported by the huge Dehida Majoris-e-Amal alliance, which has made it easier for the people to send flowers to the judges who disagree with the necessity, and trash to those who have sworn before Musarraf."
"Musarraf's promise is no longer valid."
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the exceptional measure notified on Saturday evening.
In the coming days, the Court must declare the legality of President Musarraf's re-election by an indirect vote on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
"All of which we are witnesses are illegal, constitutional and contrary to the rulings of the Supreme Court," said the president to the newspaper The News.
President Pervez Musarraf's promise that he would leave the army's front in order to fulfil the role of civilian president, "lost his status", announced on Monday, the Deputy Minister of Information, Tariq Azeem.
Musarraf had to leave the military uniform until 15 November, i.e. the end of his first presidential mandate.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed the news about the postponement of the January elections.
The Pakistani government has, by the way, dissatisfied the country-wide rumor that President Musarraf would have appointed a deputising Deputy General.
More than one third of pregnancy is not planned
This result includes unwanted (24%) or unintended or unintended pregnancies.
Even today, more than a third of the pregnancies (36%) are not planned - the French National Institute for Demographics (Ined) studies show 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which liberalizes contraception.
This result includes unwanted (24%) or unintended or unintended pregnancies.
Ined estimates that various methods of contraception, such as tablet or bee spiral, still fail in 5-6% of cases.
However, according to the Institute, the liberalisation of contraception has made 'congenital regulation' more effective. The study notes that only 5% of women between the ages of 20 and 44 were taking birth control pills in 1970, but this rate is now 60%.
Today, 8 out of 10 pregnancies are planned.
Every fifth is planning a few months with precision, and if possible by spring, because this is the most favorable season for the child.
Visual repair at the space station
Scott Parazynski and the International Space Station (ISS) crew had to work more than seven hours in space to implement the spectacular improvement of the solar panel essential to the scientific activity of the station.
This dangerous space tour has proved to be a record in many respects: repairs have taken a very long time, very little time to plan it, and had to be done with space-steamed tools, away from residential modules, by astronauts.
The problem occurred on Tuesday when astronauts removed the Harmony module from Discovery. It is a huge cylinder-shaped element that will soon be the venue for European and Japanese scientific laboratory activities (see framed section).
This module is a kind of passageway to the laboratory modules.
However, there is a need to take care of their power supply.
The second task of the crew was, therefore, to place one module producing electric current, which was already on the ISS, with the help of the 17.5 tonnes solar panels in its final place.
The crew then started opening the 76 - meter - wide solar panels of the module.
In this case, one of the consistently foldable tablets was damaged by a cable in a length of about 1 metre.
In order to avoid further injury, the table has not been opened.
The mission of the astronauts was originally to make a check-up walk from the Discovery shuttle and to fix another solar panel with a malfunctioned rotational system. Instead, their full time had to be devoted to repairing the damaged solar panel.
Scott Parazynski had the choice to perform the act hanging on a 30-metre robot arm attached to the station crane.
He's one of NASA's finest space walkers.
He has a high, strong, extremely good, muscled upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old male had to "operate" the damaged solar panel.
After a thorough assessment of the damage caused, he cut off the defective cable and recorded some "sinks" on the damaged area.
In his work he was also assisted by another "space walker" who remained near the safe passage, as well as by other astronauts, including crew captain Peggy Whitson.
The tool he used, a mini hockey bot, which the solar panels used to isolate against hundreds of volts of voltages, was fired by the station's astronauts and "sharved".
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited until his associates opened the board completely, and only after that he packed up his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took a half-day break, and today, the Discovery Space Chlora returned to begin their Wednesday return.
Exchange rate of EADS shares decreased
The exchange rate of the EADS shares on the Paris Stock Exchange fell considerably after the company that manufactures aircraft and defence equipment announced that the extension of the development of the A400M aircraft would result in an additional cost of EUR 1.2-1.4 billion.
The price of EADS shares is currently EUR 21.96 after a 4% decrease.
The company was forced to review its 2007 performance forecasts, as the development of the A400M engine is delayed, which is clearly why the aircraft will be delayed.
The delay in the transfer of the combat carrier aircraft, which was announced in October, will be "a sum of between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than 1 billion will affect Airbus", has been announced by the parent company of the European EADS manufacturing company.
As a result of these expenditures, the EADS will have to report new plan numbers for its operating result next Thursday, when it announces quarterly results, but no additional figures have been provided.
The group also indicated that the six-month delay was taken into account when preparing its new cost estimate.
In 2006, EADS’ operating result decreased by 86%: it was largely due to a delay in the development of another program, the A380 giant machine, which also put a great financial burden on the company.
The company originally planned to transfer A400M aircraft to the French army in October 2009.
Stay in the status quo
There is no great surprise for the Sunday elections: a large majority of Russians will vote for the Prime Minister of Putin, the United Russia.
In this, the Russians' need for stability, to be said, is evident after a highly manipulated campaign.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, the Russian Head of State Vladimir Putin speaks to voters on television via the public service channels, which have already been recorded, but the content is still secret.
Putin leads the Kremlin-supporting party, the United Russia's candidate list, which is expected to win a devastating victory in the election.
At the reception of foreign ambassadors yesterday, the Heads of State did not tell us anything: he has only made another run against the actions of the Western countries, which was a popular issue during the campaign.
"We know the cost of true democracy, so we want honest, absolute transparent and open elections, without any violations," he added.
However, according to the opposition, this is not the case at all.
The opposition condemns the campaign, which they believe was under pressure from the voters.
Gennj Zjuganov, leader of the Communist Party, claims that there was no such dirty election in Russia even in the time of Jelcin.
After beating last weekend's demonstrations, former chess champion Garri Kaszparov was sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorised protests, and his lawyer claims that he cannot continue to be visited.
"The Russians are still thinking like "homo lepeticus"
The predictable election results raise two more obvious questions:
- Who's following Putin in the head of state?
The official paper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, which will be 2 March 2008, and candidates will be able to indicate their intention of departure by 23 December.
Since Vladimir Putin was elected in 2000 and 2004, his mandate can no longer be extended.
But there's no other successor on the horizon.
- What role does Putin play from March?
Is he going to be a Prime Minister?
Or will he decide on the government and the President as the leader of the Almighty United Russia and the parliamentary majority?
Whatever happens, the outgoing power will prevail in both parliamentary and presidential elections.
This has become a tradition.
"The Russians are still thinking of the "homo pedeticus" way: they do not feel they can control their fate", says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada Centre.
Nikolai Koposov, historian of the University of Szentpétervár, is going even further: according to his theory, the country became a Christian five hundred years later compared to Europe, so the development of civil society is also delayed.
After the liberal reforms of the 90s, "Putin went back to the paternalist model, which was perfectly suited to the people, and more so because this new type of paternalism was not accompanied by intimidation, but with certain economic well-being," says Maria Lipman, a member of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians "reject personal responsibility", which quickly showed up after the break-up of the Soviet Union.
"Why should we think?"
The phenomenon affects all levels of society, even the business world.
The administrative elite is interested in maintaining the current situation: the local lists of Single Russia are led by 65 governors who come from the leaders of the 85 Russian regions.
Freedom imported from the West is often marked by chaos, as was the case in the 1990s.
Public opinion favours stability.
In this spirit, the Russians do not vote for extreme parties.
Tamara Cserednychenko, 54-year-old teacher, concludes: "Why should we think?
Those in power aren't so bad, why should we replace them?"
Depressive Memory
After more than 60 years of encryption, the Bad Arolsen archive became public, documenting the fate of 17 and half million victims of the Heller regime.
The 47 million archives document, which contains 27 kilometres of shelf space in Bad Arolsen, Hessen Province, has so far been researchable only for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. they only provided unique and roll-call access to the victims or descendants of Hajdan.
In May 2006, eleven states, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, which provided the management of the archive, agreed to open the archive for researchers and historians.
After each state ratified the Convention, the archive was opened yesterday.
Confidential information
The opening of the Bad Arolsen archive allows historians to carry out research on "the relocation of prisoners, the residents of camps and the health of forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, director of the archives managed by the International Commission for the Red Cross.
Until now, several States, including Germany, have opposed the disclosure of documents, as they contain their names and thus contain confidential information.
For example, these may be the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some deported victims.
The aim was to search for deported or forced civilians and possibly provide evidence of their internation, which would allow them to receive compensation.
In Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent workers are currently working on processing tens of thousands of individual needs.
However, part of the scientific community does not consider the opening of the Bad Arolsen archive to be of great importance.
"These documents are basically nothing new," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the research centre of the University of Technology in Berlin in 2006.
EU-India Free Trade Agreement signed in 2008
Indo-European bilateral trade flows are already approaching EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India’s number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign the free trade agreement in 2008, said Peter Mandelson, European Trade Commissioner and Kamal Nath, Indian Minister for Trade.
EU foreign ministers already approved last April that the European Commission should launch negotiations on the signing of free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India’s number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also India's main foreign investor, but India is only the EU's 9th most important trading partner, according to the figures of the European Commission.
Peter Mandelson said that "a free trade agreement could have an economic impact for both parties" and "India could thus increase its presence in a booming market with 450 million inhabitants".
The European Commissioner added to the ten most important products exported by India, the first or secondary importer of Europe. The two giants, Europe and Asia, each year, exchanged "a product worth EUR 47 billion" and "a service worth EUR 10 billion", announced this week, Danièle Smadja, Head of the Commission delegation in New Delhi. However, he regretted the fact that bilateral trade "has still not reached its full potential". On Friday, New Delhi, the EU and India will meet in the context of the eighth diplomatic summit, which will be attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and José Manuel Durao Barroso, President of the European Commission.

Answer to concerns: the Bank of England offers £10 billion to the financial market for a five-week period
The Bank of England wants to ease the anxiety about credit conditions, so on Thursday, it announced that it will pump GBP 10 billion into the money market, which will be available with the 5,75 % base rate and, unlike usual, this time with a five-week maturity.
"We want to alleviate the concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly bad at the end of the year, and we want banks to be able to plan their liquidity position more safely for this period. Therefore, a significant part of the Bank's reserves will be offered on the international money market as part of a five-week open market operation from 6 December", in the Bank's press release.
According to the Bank’s announcement, the market will be put on the market at 12:15 p.m. on 6 December, at £10 billion, and the central bank’s base rate will be valid for the offer and the repayment deadline will be 10 January.
This is the first time that the Bank of England has issued liquid funds for five weeks in an open market operation.
The duration of such operations is usually one week.
In the Bank of England press release, he added that "ready to take further measures" in order to adapt interbank loans to the central bank base rate.
The current interbank interest rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate exceeded the level of 18 September: it currently stands at 6.6%.
Since the beginning of the summer money market crisis, the Bank of England has calculated a significant criminal interest rate on the money market, which has reinstated the banks from using them.
According to the saying (which is only confirmed by the evolution of the pound exchange rate compared to the euro), many would have been more pleased with the resources offered by the European Central Bank, which could have been obtained with a higher interest rate and more discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to examine the socialist proposal on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre Group closed down on Thursday from discussing the articles of the socialist proposal on purchasing power, which is equivalent to rejecting the text itself.
At the meeting initiated by the Socialists, the text contained about ten measures adopted by the National Office of the Socialist Party on Tuesday, including a 50% increase in the employment allowance, the restoration of the variable fuel tax, the introduction of a travel check and the restriction of rents.
As the UMP and NC 180:115 voted against the examination of the articles, the debate between the government and the opposition on sometimes sharp speeches was finally interrupted, just a few hours before President Sarkozy's television talk on the purchasing power.
Jean-Marc Ayraul, Head of the Socialist delegation, announced that his group would resubmit all his proposals in the framework of the amendment to the draft amending Financial Law, which will be on the agenda of the Parliament next week.
A New Festival Is Born
There have been many rumors about the new Philadelphia Music Festival to be held by C3 Presents. However, now the event organizer and promotional company announced that the Vineland Music Festival will be held in New Jersey in cooperation with Melvin Benn’s British producer, the Festival Republic.
"It is an honor for us to work with a man who is the founder of today's American festival movement," said Charlie Jones of C3 to Billboard.com.
The C3 also organises the Lolpalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival in Chicago.
The New Jersey Vineland festival will be held in the summer, so it will also be possible to play a tent.
The festival will be held in a private area of 500 moons lying about 40 minutes from Philadelphia between August 8 and 10.
Melvin Benn, previously known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most respected festival organisers.
In 1989 he started the British Reading Festival, which attracts some 80,000 visitors every year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn expanded its competition with the organisation of the Leeds Festival, and in 2006 the Festival Republic was invited to live by the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Sufholk.
Melvin Benn has been a co-owner in the production, licensing and organisation of the Glastonbury Festival since 2002. This festival is now capable of hosting up to 177 500 people.
The C3 staff member, Charlie Jones the Glastonbury Festival, called it the most inspiring event he's ever attended. He added that his company and Melvin Benn's company are working simultaneously to enrich the region with a European-style festival event.
"We've already chosen the Philadelphia location, and we worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Committee to organise this festival in the centre of Philadelphia," said Charlie Jones.
"We have been negotiating with the city, and the Commission has shown great enthusiasm for our plan.
Unfortunately, however, because of the political manifestations of the city management, the organisation failed," said Charlie Jones.
"We've been able to talk about this with Melvin Benn, and now we're preparing for a huge festival at another unique location, which will ultimately serve the interests of the people of Philadelphia."
The C3 Presents created the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 in Grant Park, Chicago, after having demonstrated in 2002 its exceptional festival organizer's talent with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
In 2007, the gross income of the two events was 9.8 million and 11.3 million respectively.
Both festivals were held at a city venue.
"Melvin Benn's European concept is based on the rural festival, while our festivals usually take place in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine the two models in some way, thereby creating both the European rural atmosphere and the urban feeling of life in America."
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The people of Vineland, and even the mayor himself, are very supportive of the event," says Charlie Jones.
Although he does not talk about the details of the agreement, he explains that "the conditions are favourable enough to enable investment in an event such as this to take place at a place that hopefully will give home to the festival for a long time".
According to Charlie Jones, the festival will have a "big" size, and its capacity is approximately 80,000 people in the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennesse.
The bands have already received the invitation for the event, but nothing is final at the time of the press release.
"Vineland is basically going to be a rock festival, but we're planning a variety of musical offers so everyone can find something to please him," says Charlie Jones.
Jones and his two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles Attal, make up the C3 company that received the award of the most recent Billboard Touring Award by the "best independent event organizer".
Montreal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to lure Hollywood directors to Montreal if you have to fight with the Terminator...
"Congratulation" is one of the tasks of the montreal delegation.
The mission promises "politically difficult" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is opposed to filming his own productions abroad.
Is it really hard to put up a fight with "Terminator Governor"?
"We need to be careful, because the film industry itself decides which place is the best.
If you find conditions favourable in Montreal, you'll go there.
Our job is to offer the best possible conditions on the basis of which they decide for us," says Schwarzenegger.
A War for the Festivals
However, Denis Turcotte now focuses most on promoting Canadian films.
Because the competition for the Oscars started.
The aim is to present and promote as many Quebec films as possible at every American film festival, be it the Sundance Film Festival, the Denver, Seattle or San Francisco Film Festival.
The L'Âge des ténèbres film was welcomed a few weeks ago at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
The Palm Springs International Festival will be planned in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil will be presented in Santa Monica and in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
Quebec also represented itself with four short films and four toys this month at the American Film Institute Fest.
Will there be a rally at the end of the year on the stock market? Experts will share their views on the subprime crisis
Just five weeks before the end of the financial year, investors have already rubbed their hands and are looking forward to the end of the usual year.
This year, however, it is not clear to experts whether this will actually happen.
According to Banif, "from a statistical point of view, the stock exchange generally behaves positively in December.
However, only statistical projections are not necessarily correct and, in the current situation, uncertainty characterises the market, at least in the short term".
The experts do not initially argue that the stock exchange will last at the end of the year, although it states that "the stock exchange market will be maintained by the presence of liquidity, which is an opportunity to invest, because there are no alternatives to the guarantee, especially the fixed yield, which is adversely affected by the escape to quality securities, as long as in the short term".
They therefore believe that the stock exchange will be characterised by a lateral movement, not free of volatility, "not least since the effect of the Fed interest rate reduction is unknown, the price of crude oil is high and the inflationary tension is also at risk".
Javier Barrio, the Spanish sales manager of BPI, agrees with this, which means that it would also be risky to state that there will be a rally.
According to the expert, "the situation is not pink at all".
The loss of Ibex is nearly 4 per cent compared to the highest values recorded on 8 November, when the index was closed at 15.945,7.
Despite all this, not all experts are so obsessive.
According to Juan Solana, Ibex 35 may close the year closer to 16.000 due to the rescheduling of wallets and the contributions to the ordinary pension fund at this time.
However, the expert adds that some changes are expected this year, as it moves to the second week of December, after the long weekend of the Constitutional Day.
The analyst considers it unlikely that volatility would affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, Inversis Banco's analyst, we are close to the technical level and "there is also a fall in the stock exchange index, which may rise depending on the news from the US, as regards the consequences of the credit market crisis".
The analyst trusts that these will be beneficial.
Analysts agree on what will be the securities targeting the achievement of Ibex's new maximum quota.
Solana, from Intermoney, stresses that "this year, there is a line on the big securities".
The expert would list two large banks and some construction companies, "because by then the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Federico Olucha claims from Inversis Banco that the rise is due to the banking sector and industry.
For construction companies, the rally can also be positive, if any.
"The ACS has been trying to get their positions back for several months and we hope that Ferrovial and FCC construction companies will follow this path," says the expert.
cyclical consumption will be the main factor in the rest of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas period.
On the other hand, the expert considers that technology companies can also benefit, although the presence on the Spanish market is not too high in this area.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, there has only been a two-time fall in the December exchange rate.
The real year-end rally was observed in 2003, when the stock exchange markets emerged from the crisis caused by the burst of the technology bubble.
This year, when Ibex corrected 35 28.17 percent, a 668% jump was registered in December.
So it is still open to whether 2007 will be the fifth consecutive profitable year (i.e. 8.36% increase in Ibex since January) and whether the final rally can occur.
Banco Popular Español opens a account open for 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Banco Popular Español has decided to renew most of its accounts.
This concerns a total of 200 accounts in the most commercially affected parts of Spain.
These accounts run under the name Popular Max and bring a big change to the bank.
But also for the other Spanish institutions, as this is the first group, whose accounts are kept open on an unusual basis until 20.30 p.m., even on Saturdays from 10 p.m. to 20.30 p.m.
The other group, BBVA, which has also voiced several times that it intends to keep its accounts open, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
But he's just making a deal with the unions to close down 75% of his accounts in exchange for an afternoon, though not for the public.
The experience of Banco Popular Español will be crucial for the other institutions, which will decide on the basis of whether to join the initiative to support more favourable business opening.
This is precisely the objective of the Banco Popular Español project.
In these places, I would like to target individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, individual entrepreneurs and local businesses.
The bank wants to operate 200 branches throughout Spain for 18 months with the above opening, because it is not a new opening order, but a transformation of the existing one.
To this end, the institution modernises its branches in commercial areas according to the needs of the customers of each street.
Thus, the extension of the opening hours is accompanied by a new idea of the nature of the accounts, a more modern, more colourful design.
Mr Rivera, responsible for commercial banks, points out that there is no need for a large investment to be restructured, but they have to employ more employees, which means eight or nine employees per account instead of the current six.
The accounts, in which even negotiations for SMEs are located, will not sell financial products.
Fascinating Experiences
In the three Madrid branches of Banco Popular Español, the initiative has already been implemented.
According to Ángel Rivero, the experiences were positive.
In the streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía in Madrid, the choice fell, and according to Rivero, the decision was correct.
Banco Popular Español currently has 2.500 branches.
It operates under the name of Mundocredit, specializes in immigrants, and has a very favourable opening order, even on Sundays and holidays.
In the units mentioned by PopularMax, the model of BBVA is not used, where some accounts offer a wide range of non-financial products.
"We don't want to create competition for our clients," says Rivero.
At the moment, Telefonica was able to agree and sell mobile phones using external staff.
Telecinco first doubles the value of Antena 3
"We did it."
This sentence expressed the satisfaction of Paolo Vasile, the trusted advisor of Telecinco at the closing of the market yesterday, when it turned out that the television broadcaster was doubled the value of Antena 3.
But one thing has hidden its joy: "It only hurts that this is not because we have risen more, but because we have fallen less," he said.
He still put a great deal of emphasis on "lower" in the weak market.
Telecinco closed yesterday with 2.54 percent strength.
This increase will put its annual loss at 15.66%.
52 per cent of the company's Mediaset, 13 per cent of Vocento's, thus the stock exchange value according to Bloomberg is EUR 4.488.88 million.
His rival, Antena 3 lost 1.52 percent yesterday, and since January, he's been accounting for 40,5 percent drop, so yesterday he's worth half, 2.193,46 million.
The value of the other listed communications companies for Sogecable is 3.571 million; for Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días), 2.518,53 million and Vocento, 1.779 million.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to the similarity between the two companies.
The only question is how much we can achieve on the same market, what costs and how all this is going to turn into in terms of views.
Last week, Telecinco announced that he wanted to be the first TV channel to be more than 1 billion gross advertising revenues, said Giuseppe Tringali, Telecinco and Publicspaña.
If the notified fact were to be achieved, compared to 965.4 million recorded in the 2006 financial year, the TV channel would increase its revenues by 3.6% in this financial year.
The net turnover of Antena 3 increased by 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the financial year (this is how it reached 734.4 million), while the net sales of television increased by 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
According to the analysts, one of the factors that triggers Telecinco's stock exchange momentum is the high payout that has been held up to now: in 2006, Alejandro distributed 100% of the profits of the company led by President Echevarría.
According to Vasile - although it would be too soon to decide - this ratio may change after taking 33% of Endemol's parent company, associated with Mediaset.
"We guarantee the minimum payment of 50%, although we have always distributed much more.
I hope that our shareholders will be satisfied this year, because they have already been favoured by the acquisition of 33 percent of Endemol".
Analysts say that the market is currently characterised by some layoffs.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its yield estimates for Telecinco by 4 % in 2008 and 7 % in 2009.
This is said to be due to an estimated increase in sales in 2008 from 10,5 per cent to 8,4 per cent and from 5,5 per cent in 2009 to 5,1 per cent.
According to the same company, Antena’s 3 profits fall by 4.5 per cent in 2008 and by 7.5 per cent in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: it proposes the purchase of both securities, mainly due to the high rentability and long-term sustainability of the dividend.
2.
Caja Madrid: You see Telecinco as more favourable (purchase) than Antena 3 (maintenance) because of its "multiple attraction" and business expansion.
3.
JPMorgan: In both cases, it proposes underweight due to "comparative risks" (filled market and less favourable economic climate).
Congress approves the adoption of MiFID, which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel to the parliamentary procedure, which has today ended with the Congressional vote on the Senate amendments, the Government has launched a social dialogue on the regulation on which the law is based, so that both can enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by representatives and senators in negotiations and agreements to develop the most cost-effective standards for investors and to regulate the activities of companies in order to operate effectively on the market.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Markets Act, allows for the modernisation of financial markets while at the same time strengthening investor protection, broadening the supervisory rights of the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new directive allows financial advisory services to be provided to specialised companies, but also natural or legal persons, as well as to securities trading companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies, to establish a new financial service company form (ESS), namely financial advisory companies (AFI).
In addition, the law increases the number of systems for the execution of operations involving funds, thereby adding to regulated secondary markets multilateral trading platforms and order execution internalisation systems which are competing with current stock exchange operators.
In addition, the Act obliges investment firms to provide information on the key aspects of their business profile, risk-taking and risk management methods and to keep records of all operations carried out to facilitate the verification of the CNMV.
The Committee on Economic Affairs of the Congress has introduced a number of amendments, which are of the utmost importance that the securities are treated as a "complex" financial instrument due to the high risk to the investor (subprime) in connection with the US high-risk mortgage lending.
On the other hand, the transposition of the directive was also used to legally delineate the scope of the activities of those with economic and business qualifications, 30 years after the Royal Decree on professional functions that could be performed exclusively by economists entered into force in 1977.
The Senate proposed the creation of new players in the financial sector, such as its intermediary agent, who is working on another account, does not need the authorisation of CNMV, and at the same time can sell products to several investors or acquire customers.
The Consumer Price Index increased by 0.5 points in November to 4.1%.
This indicator, which Eurostat takes into account for the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, shows the development of prices in Spain for the month of November.
Its disclosure is in line with the strategy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank to provide data that can be compared to the data coming from the United States, both in terms of time and nature.
The calculation method used for the preliminary indicator is the same as for the calculation of the Integrated Price Index, but the statistical modelling method differs to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Statistical Office underlined that the preliminary indicator is purely informative and could therefore deviate from the final data which will be published on 14 December.
"The Consumer Price Index continues to show a relatively high value."
Pedro Solbes, a vice-president of the Government and Minister of Economic Affairs, stated that the Consumer Price Index was only "temporary" in November, but also indicated that the price index was expected to show "relatively high" values in the coming months.
In Parliament's corridors, Mr Solbes confirmed that "although the indicator is not very favourable", the inflation rate in Spain remained more or less the same within the monetary union in recent years.
He also added that the month of November "bringed less surprise" than the previous month, when the Government did not count on such an increase.
"We expected a value of around 4%" was recognised by the Minister of Economic Affairs in relation to the data published today.
Northern Rock wants to make EUR 42 billion in Virgin over three years.
Northern Rock deposits have fallen by more than 50% and currently account for only £12 billion (€16 billion) since the crisis in mid-September and had to take urgent credit from the National Bank of England.
At that time, it had a record deposit of over £25 billion, which gradually decreased over the past two and a half months due to the loss of confidence of the customers, despite the government's promise of a 100% guarantee to the bank until the end of the crisis.
Virgin will run this unit under its own financial, commercial name, Virgin Money, and will have to get about a quarter of the revenues of the British banks over the next three years to get the remaining £18 billion and thus reach the 30 billion target.
The intention of Richard Branson, a prominent businessman who has become known as the high-profile advertising campaign in England, is to spend some 50 million pounds (i.e. 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing in order to achieve the stated goal.
Northern Rock has highlighted the offer of the Virgin consortium this week as the most favourable to avoid bankruptcy. Besides Virgin, three other companies form the consortium.
The mayor of Totana was arrested for a suspected corruption case.
The Pacific Guard arrested the mayor of the town of Totana in the province of Murcia this morning, as they suspect that he was involved in the urban corruption scandal that broke out this week.
In addition, a secretary of the City Hall and the chief of police of the town were arrested.
Former city council member José Martínez Andreo took over the place of the People's Party representative Juan Morales in May, who, according to the official bodies consulted by the SER radio station, was the head of the corruption network.
The police will continue to investigate the city's offices and the City Development Council and it cannot be excluded that further arrests are expected.
Juan Morales' lawyer was also investigated as the main suspect in the corruption scandal that broke out this week.
According to SER's radio report, Juan Morales' lawyer was arrested when he left Morales with the corruption documentation in his bag.
According to police sources, the subject of the investigation is the alleged commission that Morales received in exchange for signing an urban development agreement with a Galicia construction company for the reclassification of 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently under arrest.
Mr Bono accepts the nomination of Mr PSOE in Toledo and his parliamentary presidency if the elections are won.
The former Minister of Defence, José Bono, also accepted the offer of Mr José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, to lead the PSOE list in the next parliamentary elections and to fill the parliamentary office if the socialists win the elections.
This was announced by the PSOE Secretary of State, José Blanci, at a press conference and Bono himself confirmed the party at the federal centre in the south after a meeting with Zapatero.
The Prime Minister justified his election to the former Minister by saying that "we must count with the best" in politics and Bono is "in among the best".
In addition, he added that "likely" will be the Socialist Party's candidate for Parliament's presidential office if the Socialists win in the forthcoming elections.
Mr Bono would take over the place of the current President of Parliament, Manuel Marín, who announced on 15 November that he would not intend to take up the next elections and, giving up his political career, would rather fight against climate change in scientific circles.
The former minister acknowledged that the Prime Minister continued to fight to return to the scene of politics since he left active politics two years ago.
He added that since the voters are aware of who will be the vice-president of the economy in case of the socialists' victory, the party wanted to inform them of who would be the President of Parliament.
If Bono is really going to fill in the post, he wants Parliament to be "the scene of respect and not of insult or screaming" and to be more like the home of citizens.
"At times, unfortunately, Parliament seems to be the only place in Madrid, where it is not possible to talk peacefully, has happened to have been interrupted 26 times by the Prime Minister's speech in the Senate".
At the same time, he praised the current President, Mr Manuel Marín, for his 'good work', but he did not want to make himself president anymore, so that his opponents did not consider him 'supervisor'.
Climate campaign
Since the climate change movement has been ruthlessly pursuing both those who are sceptical about their predictions and those who prefer political or social battles, they must be very strong.
In fact, he must put a political leader such as the Prime Minister Zapatero, who said that the movement is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism, and declare that 'we must conclude a new agreement with our Earth'.
However, this comment raises the question of the extent to which the activity or inactivity of its government has contributed to the failure of Spain to comply with the Kyoto Convention within the Union.
Who are responsible for non-compliance with the Convention, which sector are affected and why has the Government not sought to avoid it?
In addition, Spain should clearly explain what measures it intends to take to contain climate change.
Which companies will be affected by these measures, which habits of the population need to change, what individual and social energy savings we need to expect and what economic consequences will this have?
So who needs to sacrifice and pay to save our Earth?
But we didn't get and we won't be able to explain these questions.
Exactly because it's about sacrifice and money.
Climate change has taken measures, actual measures are always unpopular.
They are costly, uncomfortable and have costs for both companies and the population.
Even the increase in PSOE's gas prices would have meant so unpopular before the elections that Zapatero had quickly withdrawn it.
That is, we need to save the Earth with texts that are purely propaganda, empty, free from real consequences.
Conventions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With the agreement with Earth, as the Prime Minister says, who speaks so nicely in the election campaign, does not demand, attack, even decorates election meetings and wakes us up.

They arrested the mayor of Totana and the chief of police for a suspected corruption case.
The Pacific Guard arrested the mayor of Totana, the mayor of the Province of Murcai, Andreot José Martínez of the People's Party, the local police chief, the secretary of the City Hall and a hospitality contractor for crimes related to urban development.
The mayor was arrested in his home, then transferred to the City Hall, currently with several police officers, many of whom are investigating the City Development Council and the municipal body responsible for the management of the Industry and Housing.
The three arrests were prevented last Monday from arresting six persons in Galicia, Madrid and Murcia in connection with a case in which 2 hectares of agricultural land were converted into an integral area in order to allow the construction of 4000 flats for Galicia Nuaria, after having been unlawfully paid to the leaders during their previous mandate.
Two other persons have not yet been arrested, but are under investigation according to the information of the Totanian Court of Justice No. 1.
The first six arrested were handed over to the court.
According to official sources, the former Mayor of Totana Juan Morales, who today is an independent parliamentary representative of the People's Party, is also under investigation.
The ex-wife, who is the owner of a real estate agency registered in Totana, is also being investigated as well as the former mayor's current girlfriend, who lives in the centre of Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group Manuel N.The lawyer and contractor were arrested in Nigeria (Pottevedra), together with the director of the Suelo de Inmonuar company Pablo José M.G., who is part of the Nuaria Group and has been subjected to the bribes through it.
The investigation is carried out by a group of persons responsible for crimes committed at the Government level of the Operational Unit of the Pacific Guard, whose members conducted eleven house searches outside the arrests, in particular with the arresters, operating in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
In Totana, one person was arrested: the owner of a company with well-known poultry products in the area, who could play an intermediary role in the case.
The Nuaria Group would have created the largest residential park in the city of Totana, where 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels would have been built.
The company has acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which has been reclassified. The project would have doubled the population of the current town of 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa e Inomonuar, Preconiza, which specialises in direct marketing of real estate, and Preconiza, which is responsible for the parking of Coruna, Venezuela streets in Vigo and the sale, promotion and installation of building elements.

If you agree, we'll put aside the Monthly Book and see if we can acquire some philosophical knowledge and wisdom.
I've already set up one.
People, life is a constant change.
Of course, everyone can figure something out for themselves.

Our Finnish reporter found this comment in one of Finland's largest daily journals: (almost above the world's level of culture in the PISA report), in the Helsingin Sanomat, referring to what appeared at the same time as the criticism of Blackburn's book on 18 November.
"The philosophical teachings came before the public after the tragedy of the Jokela high school.
The killer quoted Plato's and Nietzsche's writings in messages from a pre-school student.
On the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper Pekka Elo, who was tasked with teaching philosophy, insisted that teachers examine Plato's teachings with a critical view and added that Nietzsche's knowledge is not necessarily important at the compulsory basic philosophy classes of high schools".

One of your colleagues informs us that the Penal Code contains the offence of downloading the Internet:
A. The download of a number is considered to be an error and can be punished for a period of six months.
However, if you steal a record worth less than EUR 400 in a store, it will only be an infringement (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal EUR 1000 in a store, theft is already a crime, but the penalty still does not reach the level of the penalty for downloading the Internet (Article 234 of the BTC).
C. If you steal a car, but take it back in 40 hours, the penalty still does not reach the level of the penalty for downloading the Internet (Article 244.1).
D. You can count on a smaller penalty if you get into a fight than if you copy CDs.
If you are involved in a mass fight, you can get a penalty from three months to one year (Article 154 of the BTC), while the CD will be copied from six months to two years
(Article 270 of the BTC).
E. According to article 184.2 of the BTK, sexual harassment at work is not as serious as a DVD film download.
F. The distribution of copyright-protected films is more punishable without the consent of the authors than the sale of pornography materials to minors (Article 186).
If my colleague's right, someone's really out of control.

My home doctor gave me an article on strange research with the following title: "The money causes brain activity, especially if the others have less."
So on the day of pay, the feelings of the workers depend on how much the others got.
The experiment was carried out at the University of Bonn by measuring the tomography of magnetic resonants, and the results were also published in the last issue of Science.
The author of the study and the head of the Neurocognition Group of the German Institute of Life&Brain, Bernd Weber, thought: "The strongest activity was measured when the participant answered correctly, while his partner was wrong".
Researchers found that if both were given the right answer and received the same amount of money, the brain activity was moderate, but if one of them received a double amount, the activity was strengthened.
I have no idea why such a great science needed such a simple compromise.
Attorney General of the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been ruthlessly pursuing war criminals in the Hague and the Criminal Court's Prosecutor's Office for crimes in the former Yugoslavia.
His mandate expires at the end of the year, and Carla leaves with a slightly bitter mouthwash, as the responsible for the renegade in Srebrenica, during which 8,000 Muslims from Bosnia have been slaughtered, namely General Ratko Mladic and the Bosnia-Herzegovina leader Radova Karajics are still on the loose.
Their names are on the list selected by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach as the title of his documentary film: Carla's list (not yet presented in Spain in 2006). Like true crime, the film follows the work of Swiss Attorney General from Belgrade to New York as he tries to put pressure on the affected governments to need a loop around refugees.
What kind of insurance does it fit me?
Vehicle insurance, which provides security to the car owner in relation to the various damages, depends on several factors such as age, gender, licence acquisition date, family status, type of car to be insured and type of use.
Getting the car is just the first step.
In fact, choosing the right insurance is often more difficult than deciding what kind of car we want.
First of all, we need to be aware of what this is about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insurance company.
This agreement is a body killed in the form of an insurance contract, which states that the insurance company is liable for compensation in the event of the occurrence of the claim in the event of the fixed premium.
The premium is practically the amount paid for insurance, which is determined by taking into account various factors, such as age, gender, the date of obtaining a licence, the family status, the type of car to be insured, its use and others.
Insurance companies determine the insurance premium on the basis of statistics, i.e. a higher amount, by the person representing a higher risk of accidents.
That is why women over 25 years of age or women pay less because statistics show that they pose a lower risk because they are more cautious.
Similarly, according to the findings, insurance companies have concluded that married people also cause less accidents than lonely people.
The frequency for the type of use of the car is the final one.
More frequent use increases the possibility of an accident.
When determining the premium, insurance companies take into account a number of factors.
Therefore, the owner has to look carefully to choose the most appropriate form of insurance for his profile.
The following are the key factors in the choice so that it can best adapt to the needs of the insured person and create an acceptable price.
When concluding an insurance contract, people under the age of 25 have to deal with a number of disadvantages, such as lack of driving experience and freshness of the licence.
Although the most ideal thing is that if we are insured against every threat, there are more economical solutions.
More careful leaders can make complete insurance with you, thus being insured against all dangers, and the price will be affordable.
In a contract of this type, the insured person pays part of the damage.
"The amount of self-insurers' contributions depends on the insurance premium; the higher the fee, the lower the self-insurers' share," says Luis Noguera, the head of First Europa, the Internet Insurance Mediator in Spain.
Another option is liability insurance extended to third parties when the client ensures himself against the damage caused to others, but not against the damage caused by his own car.
In addition, there will be insurance against theft, firecracker and car loss.
Good advice.
If you are not already 25 years old, be careful and preferably avoid accidents, as this affects the bonus and thus reduce the amount to be paid in the future.
The benefits granted by the insurance company in relation to its base rate are called a bonus.
And we call the penalty paid in comparison to the basic tariff a malus.
"The extent of the bonus and of the mill depends on the insurance company and its profits.
If the company had a good year, you can afford to increase the amount of the bonus" explains Noguera.
If you are over the age of 25, it is easier for owners to provide adequate insurance, as the risk of accidents is reduced thanks to the experience gained over the years.
Then we advise you to make full insurance with you.
"In general, young people are not yet able to properly apply their experience in any accident or even in any case of leadership", says the Spanish director of the European Insurance Company, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of leadership when leaders have already exceeded the fear of beginners.
If the insured person is already married but has no children, it is best to make a full insurance policy, of course, if your financial options allow it.
The insurance companies keep married couples with children for the lowest risk clients, so the fee to be paid in their case is also lower.
In this case, it is best to have complete insurance with yourself (this can reach 300 euros) or if they have a higher bonus, the car can extend insurance to the damage caused to others from the third year of the vehicle.
"They drive more calmly, but they have greater customer power and can afford to be higher self-sufficient," confirms Luis Noguera.
In the case of pensioners, we recommend complete insurance with a self-preservation (about 150 euros) or a higher bonus can be extended to liability insurance.
Motor insurance is very important, not only because it is a protection for the owner in the event of damage, but also because it is a high cost, so it is essential that we choose the personalised form of insurance properly.
He's trying to get the Celtic point in Milan to get into the 8th final.
On Tuesday, Milan and Celtic will measure their strength in the San Siro Stadium to get the missing point when closing the League of Champions, and the Italians will be the first, and the Scots will be able to qualify themselves.
The Italians have a total of ten points, and in the fifth round they have already secured progress with a tie with Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but one more should not be prevented by the six-point Shakhtar, who will be fighting the four-point Benfica.
The two games of Group D will be held one week before the end of the sixth round, as Milan will have to play in Japan at the Club World Championship, where on 13th the semifinal will try to fight the progress of the 16th final.
With this, Group D will close sooner than the others, and although the most likely result in the Giuseppe Meazza stadium will be the final one, the two teams will seek victory, because the Italians will not want to miss their home, and the Celtic will be the first to start from a better place in the 8th final.
Even the defeat of Gordon Strachan's team is enough to qualify if Shakhtar doesn't win, but it can't be certain, because if there's a point equality, the Ukrainians will be able to continue, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won the next match (2-0).
The Italians will try to make Scotland's evening miserable, who want to get into the 8th finals of the Reorganised Champions League twice in a row after they were given a goal by the Kaka in the extension after the 0-0 final (1-0) in the previous season.
Shakhtar would be happy to win the Rossoners, because if he loses the Celtic he'll be in the eighth final and he'll be in the UEFA.
Since Benfica, despite being in the final position and impossible to remain in the European championship, can still get the third place with a win to play in UEFA.
Twenty thousand people went to Vancouver to take part in the first concert of the Spice Girls tour.
The Spice Girls started their tour in Vancouver, Canada, for the first time in their lives, they performed for the first time since they broke up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) were announced a few minutes before the concert in Vancouver GM Place.
Some 20,000 people have changed tickets to attend the concert, where a video film was presented in the 1990s, about the history of the group that had won huge successes.
At the same time as the band's reassembled and tour, the EMI has also launched a new album in Spain, including the larger hits and two new songs "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five of the Spice Girls came on stage in a bracelet from Posh Spice's husband, British football player David Beckham.
The athlete was also there in the room of GM Place’s full view, although Victoria banned him a few days earlier.
At the time of the performance, Victoria Beckham said that the British football star "has not seen our performance dress, so I'm nervous about what she'll think of the performance".
'Sporty Spice' was the reason that the band broke up two years after leaving the band in 1998 'because the members didn't understand each other'. He also seemed nervous at the press conference that they held two hours before the concert.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that the feelings that people felt about Spice Girls have changed.
I thought why not? I'm glad I decided that now," Chisholm said about the band that broke up nine years earlier because of it.
The singer added that in the meantime, "things were settled and we love each other very much."
But a lot of things have changed since the Spice Girls last played in 1998.
According to CTV's television reports, he arrived on the Virgin Airlines special plane in Vancouver.
There was a bunch of baby-sitters at the airport.
Five of them have seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the team will perform in California (USA), then San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
They will perform in Madrid on 23 December.
More fears of the Russian-Ukrainian gas dispute
The gas dispute between Ukraine and Russia has been renewed, which could also affect Russian fuel to be delivered to Western Europe.
Most of the Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) is transferred through Ukraine, and the discussions between the two nations are always closely monitored.
Kiev stated that if Moscow increases the price of gas paid by the Ukrainians, they will also have higher transit costs in Russia.
As a result of a previous debate between the two countries last year, supplies to EU countries have been reduced.
The latest debate between Kiev and Moscow took place on the agreement attempt by the Ukrainian Government and the Russian State-owned natural gas monopoly Gazprom on the price of gas to be paid to Russia in 2008.
Gazprom stated that the gas produced from neighbouring Turkmenistan should be increased by 50% compared to the price agreement with Ukraine in 2008.
According to the analysts, this may mean a 40% increase in the price of the shipment from Gazprom to Ukraine.
"It is important to argue in line with one of the most important gas transport countries during the negotiations," said the Ukrainian Minister of Economic Affairs Anatolij Kinah to Reuters' news agency.
"The changes in gas prices should certainly be linked to our debate on the scale of the costs of transit across Ukraine (and to Western Europe).
As a result of the recent major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom closed the gas team to Ukraine in January 2006.
This has resulted in a dominant fall in exports to Western Europe, which has also strongly pushed prices.
One quarter of the European Union's gas supply is made up of Russian gas.
Russia has the largest natural gas reserves in the world, but most of them are still unexplored.
As a result, Gazprom will supplement its own gas supply with natural gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet states in Central Asia.
NHS is "compulsory to check foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS Committees should improve the monitoring of criminal records of workers from outside Europe, a supervisory body said.
The proposal was presented by Robert Black, chief accountant, after a doctor of foreign nationality in Scotland was linked to an attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concerns that NHS Scotland does not have accurate data on the number of overseas workers.
At the same time, he pointed out in his report - through a sample of five health authorities - key controls that have been carried out properly.
Following an attack on the Glasgow airport, the chief auditor checked the list of staff recruited outside the European Economic Area.
The 28-year-old Bilal Abdullah, a doctor of Iraqi origin at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep hit the building headquarters.
Abdullah was one of the three doctors who were interviewed by the Old Bailey Court on the charge of attempted car bombings in the United Kingdom in October.
For staff coming from overseas countries, the NHS Committees should check the existence of the qualifications and work experience of the workers concerned and their provision for working in the United Kingdom before starting employment.
Although the Scottish Health Committees apply the Disclosure Scotland in order to ensure the verification of the criminal record, the Agency is not entitled to obtain such information from outside the United Kingdom.
Among other things, the report from the High Numbering Officer suggested that committees introduce a guide to the Criminal Registry Office, which facilitates the monitoring process with the various overseas countries for the employer.
"Although we found evidence of such checks in the records of staff, they are not regularly implemented," states the report.
According to Black, the Scottish NHS performs its own pre-employment screening process at a high level, adding: "Our report highlights the developmental areas of the system in order to provide up-to-date information on the number of NHS overseas personnel".
Dr. Peter Terry, President of the BMA Scotland, said that it is "very improbable" that we could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future through pre-employment checks.
"The report states that the pre-employment checks currently used are working well in NHS Scotland and that the value of the proposals is not yet transparent", he added.
According to the Scottish health authorities, the majority of their current staff, consisting of doctors and nurses, account for 1161.
However, the chief auditor pointed out that the figures are likely to be higher, which is partly explained by the fact that the Commission has a problem with the identification of staff on permanent leave.
The investigation has also shown that the control procedures introduced in the Ayrshire and Arran regions, the Grampin, the Greater Glasgow and Clyde, the Lanarkshire and the NHS authorities in Lothian are in a high degree of coordination.
These procedures covered the verification of passports, work permits and certificates of competence.
The Scottish Government is still examining the directive and guidance on pre-employment checks for employees from NHS overseas countries.
Nicola Sturgeon's Health Secretary said: "It was very pleased that after the attack on Glasgow airport, this task was carried out.
In addition, he added that the Scottish Government, in cooperation with the Health Committees, will take into account the proposals in the report and will ensure that the updated guidelines on pre-employment checks for the entire staff members' granular, including those from overseas, reflect the best practical application.
The Joy Division Tarol at the Film Awards
The Biopic of Ian Curtis, the "Control", was made of Joy Division's late singer, and five prizes were passed on to the British Independent Film Awards, among other things, for the best film.
The main character, Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before Curtis was formed, as well as Anton Corbijn director and Toby Kebbell co-star.
The award for the best actress was won by Dame Judi Denmark with the Thriller "Participation of a scandal."
The Variety Prize was taken by Daniel Craig, the Bondist.
The prizes were awarded during the festival at Roundhouse, London.
The film "Control" presents Curtis's rise in Joy Division's Berkee until 1980, when he committed suicide at the age of 23 years.
The production of "The Killers", David Bowie, and the black and white film that included "New Order on the Soundtrack" cost only £3 million.
The Dutch photographer Corbijn, who was previously known as the album cover of the U2 Joshua Tree, was still rich in two prizes, with the best director and the best beginner.
Another award winner of the festival placed rock music at the centre; Julien Temple Joe Strummer's film about Clash singer took the award for the best documentary film.
Viggo Mortensen was awarded the award to the best actor for the performance of David Cronenberg's Thriller in London as the driver of the Mafia Chief of the Great Promises.
Ray Winstone, who became famous for his hard-on roles, received Richard Harris for his outstanding contribution to the British film industry.
The fifty-year-old actor, whose name includes "Scum", "Night" and "Sexy Dog" films, is currently involved in the film "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal. "
Winstone is proud to take over the award for "Camelo" and "Harry Potter" of his star, Harris, died in 2002.
"For people like me, people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened the door," added Winstone.
"I feel really lucky to have met Richard Harris several times.
Richard Harris' style is close to me, he was a great actor of his age, and I really respect him."
The selection of independent film prizes known as Bifa is decided by a group of film directors, actors and festival organisers.
Among Bifa's supporters and patrons are Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 people have been arrested in Saudi Arabia in connection with a terrorist conspiracy
Yesterday, Saudi Arabia has announced that 208 militants involved in terrorist cells have been arrested, who are planning to carry out an attack on an oil installation, as well as several attacks on church and security forces.
According to the state television of the world's largest oil exporter, one of the cells wanted to smuggle missiles.
The supporters of Al-Qaida have launched a campaign against the Monarchy, which has been operating since the 2003 Iraq invasion as an ally of the United States.
According to television reports, eight cells led by a foreign citizen are intended to launch an attack on an oil plant in the Eastern Province.
After the 2006 Al-Qaida attack on Abqaiq's largest oil-processing equipment in the world, Saudi Arabia began to build a 35 000 rapid reaction force to protect facilities.
According to the report from the Minister of Home Affairs, 18 of the arresters belong to a cell led by a "specialized person for missile attacks" that has been illegally crossing the border.
The report also reported that the warriors tried to smuggle eight bullets into the Kingdom territory.
On 22 of the arrests, a series of plans were made to commit the attacks on church leaders and security forces.
The government called on the church leaders to step up their efforts to stop the Saudis who join the Al-Qaida fighters, who are fighting against the Allied Forces and the U.S.-supported Muslim government. The latter is considered a heresy by the Saudi hardline Sunnits.
Al-Qaida fighters consider a significant part of the Church leaders of Saudi Arabia to be involved by the authorities in supporting the government’s royal family policy.
The fighters of the organization - encouraged by the call of Al-Qaida's Saudi leader Osama bin Laden to target the Western-friendly Saudi government - targeted the attack on settlements, government buildings and energy facilities of foreign people.
"The security forces have made huge efforts in the past five months" - said a Home Office spokesperson for state television.
During the arrests, a 16-person "median cell" was also caught in Medina, aimed at the dissemination of "takfiri thinking". Takfiri thinking is the ideology of Sunnita Muslim radicals, which supports the violent action by the disbelief and disbelief of embalmed Muslims.
Among those arrested were 32 persons accused of financial support from the militants.
The Venus climate can provide an insight into the Earth’s future
According to the scientists yesterday, Venus was once able to provide pleasant living conditions.
Data from a European orbital spaceship indicate that this planet is much more regarded as the Earth's whimsical twin brother than we thought before.
Venus is the nearest planet word on Earth.
The size of the two planets is almost the same and their orbit is similar, although Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
According to scientists today, thousands of years ago, Venus could have had very similar living conditions to Earth and even living conditions.
However, because of the high carbon-glass house effect of the jump, the atmospheric erosion caused by sunlight and the lower speed of the planet, Venus has entered a different developmental course in a sea.
Today, the water has evaporated from the planet, its surface temperature is hot enough to melt the lead, and hurricane winds and lightning storms will be destroyed.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express space probe - based on a year's study of the planet - represent a striking picture of how similar disastrous climate changes can occur on Earth.
Fred Taylor, professor of physics at Oxford University, who is also one of the leaders of Venus Express, said: "See why Venus's climate is so far different from that experienced on Earth, even though the two planets are otherwise very similar.
"With the help of our new data, it has been possible to develop a scenario for the development of Venus billions of years ago, when it could still have living conditions similar to the Earth.
Police busy "extreme uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material - reportedly enriched uranium - was taken by the Slovaks and the Hungarian police yesterday.
According to a police spokesperson, three people were arrested and the material was also examined.
The spokesperson did not confirm whether or not it was a enriched uranium, but claimed that the material could have been sold for $1 million (480 000 pounds).
Open doors open
According to Mitt Romney, it is not worthy of a presidential candidate to answer questions from a snowman.
However, the Republican candidates for the presidential election agreed to participate in a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and forwarded them to candidates.
None of the questions on Wednesday nights of November 28 proved as ridiculous as the snowman who asked the Democrats about global warming in his debate on YouTube of the other party.
However, this time the questions and answers well reflected the situation of the Republican Party approaching next year's election.
For the time being, it is not known that CNN’s co-financing managers have selected the YouTube clips submitted to the candidates on the basis of exactly what they had chosen.
The longest issue of the first half of the debate was immigration.
This topic is one of the Republicans' copper parrots.
The CNN asked some uncertain voters to dial a number if there is something that appeals to them: the mediator has experienced outstanding agreement when the candidates made a tough statement on the question of borders.
The brightest and longest debate was between Rudy Giuliani at national level and Romney, who took the lead in the decisive pre-elections held in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to change the picture of him that during his mayorship in New York, he has dealt with the issue of illegal immigration too lightly.
He accused Romney of hiring illegal immigrants to build his house in Massachusetts.
The talk between you and me became particularly intense when you asked questions about the support for 'amnestia' (which would provide illegal immigrants with permanent status and the possibility of citizenship).
Some candidates with fewer votes - such as California California and Tom Tancredo's colouring representatives - have managed to make a substantial contribution to the subject.
And while none of them are considered to be an opportunity on the label, their remaining on the racetrack may be explained by the fact that they started to rang the bells of immigration sooner and more loudly than the others.
At least there is broad agreement between candidates on the issue of immigration: a common objective is to strengthen borders and a tough response to illegal immigrants.
This theme, like the fear of Chinese toxic games and other alarming factors from the outside world, helps Republicans to forget or minimise the division between the liberals and the Christian conservatives.
However, when other types of issues were raised, the debate was very unpleasant.
Giuliani had to face the question of why he had previously supported arms control.
John McCain and Romney debated whether simulated water strangulation should be considered torture.
Another questioner wondered if the candidates believed all the words of the Bible.
On this issue, Giuliani finally made a point of view that, although he considered the Bible to be his favorite book, the story of Jonah and the whale might not be literally understood.
Another question was whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, who won the first place of the Iowa election, who, due to his victory, was reacting to the expectations of the Christian conservativeism, reacted to the death penalty, but it was necessary.
When they were explaining whether Jesus would receive sufficient support, he laughed, saying that Jesus was wiser than he would go to the elections.
Competition remains unusually open.
Huckabee Iowa's momentum coincides with the liberarian Ron Paul's fundraiser action and his enthusiasm during the Wednesday's debate.
The sudden emergence of the two candidates is explained by the fact that the two wings of the party have not yet managed to launch a joint candidate among the more well-known and traditional aspirants.
In 1980 and 2000, there was a candidate who united the party, who made timely and convincing contributions to the victory message of the size of America and who found a common voice with both wings of the party.
Now, however, the party has been divided, and its consequences are still ineligible.
Labour pain
Another gap in front of Gordon Brown; the way out is unchanged
Compared to the British political scandals, the current situation does not seem to be too blatant.
No one sold their honor, no politicians presented their hotel accounts in Paris, no one committed any out-of-married scandal.
But discovering that for more than four years, a rich businessman has contributed more than $650,000 ($1.3 million) to the Grand Brittany Governor’s Labour Party, and that this party has not reported, is one of the things without which the surrounded Gordon Brown would have found it well.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister got away with the election, and when his statement - that public research did not influence the outcome of the decision - unthinkably questioned the British intellectual ability, people were still hoping that Brown would ensure a strong and effective governance.
Instead, as Vince Cable pointed out, the Vice President of Liberal Democrats with increasingly intellectual remarks, the once feared Brown Stalin became Mr. Bean.
The illegitimate move to save Northern Rock has put regulatory weaknesses and limitations in judgment.
Patient proposals to change the tax law encouraged business interest groups to work together with the government.
The loss of 25 million people's personal data by the tax authorities has revealed an inconceivable degree of administrative negligence.
In the House of Lords, three retired generals protested against a reduction in the military budget, stating that the position of the Minister of Defence is part-time employment.
And now here are David Abrahams' mysterious contributions; Peter Watt, Secretary-General of the Labour Party (previously administrative leader) has already resigned.
These accidents don't mean Brown can't turn back on the way out.
At the same time, governments can reach the point where governance is impossible.
People don't like politicians and don't trust them, but when a new group comes to power, they usually stop their disbelief.
As it becomes clear, however, that the Prime Minister is most likely not to be able to advance things, and perhaps not to remain on his post for a long time, the suspended disbelief is over: the civil servants' body is starting to leak, the office ministers are going to be looking for instructions, the press is looking for bad-mouthed news, and the government is going to be unable to focus on defence and defence.
In a sense, Brown is in a particularly difficult situation because, unlike other political leaders, he does not count as "fresh blood".
As much as you'd like to deny your relationship with Tony Blair, it was his right hand.
The problems surrounding Northern Rock and the tax administration records relate, for example, to decisions taken during Brown's finance ministry.
And while Blair's misdemeanors - such as the protracted examination of the relationship between the "money nobility" and political party funding - have not been directly involved, voters can rightly assume the opposite.
Although Brown's situation is very unpleasant, it's not as embarrassing as it looks.
The brawls taken are not as scary as their throats indicate.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, no one was directly picked up.
And compensation, as much as it pains, can always be the creation of the trends promised by Stalin, who lives in Brown: reliable, solid and slightly hard-handed governance.
Good example is the cool around political donation.
Abrahams, who compares his donation to charity, declared that his good deed was not intended to be made public.
Perhaps so, but making a decision was not his responsibility.
The law prohibiting the anonymisation of large political supporters is clear and clearly justified: the population has the right to know who knocks on the door of the country's leaders.
Watt, who, according to his own statement, knew of Abrahams' action, was not aware of its illegal nature, will certainly be sweating during the interviews; as will Jon Medleson, the head of the Labour Party, who informed about the confusing donations in October.
To Brown, however, for now, there are no leads: there is no indication that he knew about these rolls, even that the huge sums were paid after Brown took office in June.
Until now, the Prime Minister has completed half the task.
Although he was soon condemned by his party, his firmness was diluted to a familiar instrument; he was tasked with investigating the case, for the sake of safety, by a committee led by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this story, "learning to learn" is not too complicated.
In the event of a violation of the law, the police are responsible.
In addition, Brown has to make other things right, such as the appointment of the chairman of an independent committee on administrative rules, which has been operating for six months without leadership, or the prioritisation of an effective reform of political party funding.
This would require the hard hat Labour Party to cooperate with the stories and break up with the associations' special financial relations - this would be a tough wall for the party Brown.
But you'd have to face some of the facts about the party.
According to the surveys, the conservatives are currently having a serious advantage; Brown has two years to win back the voters behind him; the only way to make a victory is unconvenient integrity and strong competence.
Card sharks
Is the second-market mortgage crisis threatening the American credit card market?
When blood comes into the water, it is natural that sharks appear nearby.
Now that the American housing market is weakening, predators are focusing on the country's credit card market.
The analysts of Goldman Sachs believe that if the mortgage crisis infects other forms of retail credit, the loss of the credit card market could reach up to 99 billion dollars.
The signs of tension are clear.
Both the rate of default and the rate of default for late payments over 30 days have been increased.
HSBC reported a loss of $1.4 billion last month in the US consumer financing segment, partly due to the financial weakness of cardholders.
At the same time, panic is too soon.
The proportion of descriptions and late payments remains low.
The 3.89% late payment rate calculated by Moody's credit rating agency for the third quarter is one percentage point lower than the historical average.
The reduction in the rates is partly explained by technical factors.
The amendment of the rules on individual insolvency in the United States in 2005 has resulted in a sudden decrease in the number of reporting agents, while at the same time it has caused large losses in the market for credit cards; a re-growth of the number (and the description ratio) of bankruptcy claims is expected, whether or not the total of the terms of the borrowing will deteriorate.
The payment rate, which shows the proportion of monthly credit repayments to consumers, is also solid on the market.
In addition, trust in securities covered by the credit card is also quite strong, despite the paralysis in other areas of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney at TowerGroup's research firm estimates that the volume of emissions in 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The impact of the mortgage crisis on the credit card market is clear: consumers increase the debt on credit cards to pay for mortgage loans.
At the same time, card issuers are primarily watching money and not asset value, so the fall in house prices does not necessarily lead to changes in the creditworthiness of borrowers.
The situation may be beneficial to creditors.
If the property is less than the value of mortgage loans, consumers will be encouraged to repay credit; as a result, repayment of debts on credit cards will be more priority-oriented.
By changing interest rates or credit limits, card issuers can adapt faster and more flexibly to changing conditions than mortgage creditors.
In theory, this should reduce the risk of sudden re-flowing of assets.
"It's unlikely that one day we'll be able to fully re-evaluate the loans," says Gary Perlin, Financial Director of Capital One.
If a subprime sudden crisis on the credit card market is less likely, the risk of a gradual decline will be much more likely.
If the falling housing market prices and the decline in lending put America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly look forward to a harsh future.
It's worth monitoring those predators.
The British bankers have confessed to the Enron case.
On Wednesday he confessed his guilt to the three British bankers who were courted by Enron's former financial director, Andrew Faston, in order to investigate their role in fraud.
At first, David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were found innocent in the charge of seven-day fraud, suggesting that they were working with Fastow in a secret fraud in 2000 to make them rich at the expense of their employer.
Their trial began in January.
But at a court hearing before the U.S. judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each of them admitted his guilty of one - order fraud.
Three former employees of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group's Greenwich NatWest division have become known in Great Britain during the two-year extradition process.
The closure of the investigation of Enron following its collapse in 2001 is still pending in the United States.
In 2002, the first prosecution warned Fastow that he was one of the targets of the government investigation into Enron's bankruptcy.
The three brokers crucified to "NatWest's Three" were charged with travelling to Houston in 2000 to prepare fraud with Fastow and Michael Kopper, who was then the right hand of Fastow.
Fastow, responsible for planning countless fraud that bankrupt Enron, also held under the control of Enron’s subsidiary, in which Greenwich NatWest invested.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had no knowledge of any shares in the subsidiary, but the three men in Britain well knew that the interest was very high.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the bank's share of the USD 1 million in the subsidiary.
The bankers paid Kopper $25,000 to acquire a stake in this company.
According to the charge, Fastow misinformed Enron by buying the 20 million dollar subsidiary shares from the energy company Greenwich NatWest.
In fact, however, the 20 million dollars hit the mark of British bankers, Fastow, and others.
The prosecution considers bankers worth 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others made 12.3 million dollars.
In January 2004, Fastow confessed to his two-order guilt for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British Three was arrested three months later.
Fastow's currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper spends three years and a month in a Texas prison.
The three English men could travel to the United States in a bail of $1 million each.
Enron, the seventh largest American company, reported a bankruptcy in December 2001, after the accounting tricks that have been used over the years, could no longer cover the millions accumulated as debt or the profitable but actually loss-making companies.
As a result of the collapse, thousands of jobs were lost, the market value was over $60 billion and the value of pension funds was down by more than $2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, founder of Enron and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their contribution to the company's bankruptcy.
Skilling is currently in prison for more than 24 years.
The conspiracy, fraud and other charges imposed on Lay have ended with the man's death last year.
No poverty in Moscow
A Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine, starts at $54 million, which will make the journey between Moscow and Los Angeles without interruption, with a tank.
However, this amount is only small for some Russian rich people.
"The 18 passengers can fit in," said Dan Firer, the Gulfstream representative.
"But no one orders so many seats because machines are purchased for private families or business leaders."
Mr. Firer was expecting visitors at the four-day exclusive Milliomos Fair, which was organized in a large exhibition hall around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury items have been rented at the exhibition, hoping that Russian newcomers will be interested in all the coolants, covered with diamonds, from mahogany yachts to the 50 cents.
Mr. Firer carefully watched the bright orange Porsche on the stand next to him.
"He's a nice car, but he doesn't touch our products," he said.
"Private aircraft have the largest market in Russia after the United States."
It looks like the Russian capital is swimming in money, like Dallas did in his light age, at the time of the oil explosion.
"We went through a similar process in the 1890s when some U.S. millionaires went to Europe. These Americans were considered materialists here." said Marshall Goldman, Senior Scholar of the Davis Center of Harvard University Studies in Russia and Eurasian.
Like Japanese gamblers from Saudi Arabia and Japan in the 1990s, the Russians have now become the most spectacular poets in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands require their share of the gold platter.
At another conference organised by the luxury industry in Moscow, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnaul, president of the LVMH shared his views on how to sell high-value products on markets similar to Russia.
(The conference was organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
According to Forbes' richest list, there are 53 billion people living in Russia, with a total of 282 billion dollars.
In addition, the number of second-class Russian millionaires has reached 103 thousand, who can receive a total of $670 billion, and has found a study conducted by economists of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research in the former Soviet Union.
(The World Bank's data show that 15.8 per cent of the population living under the standard of living in Russia in 2005 was 15.8 per cent.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires living in Moscow, which is why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris Jewelry in London.
Nicole took part in the fair for the first time with the Russian distributor of the brand Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are carefree, and men are a real treasure mine."
On Sunday evening, two property market agents, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, were both dedicated to a millionaire.
"I looked at the cars and tried to make a decision between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said the young Yumatova, who rushed into his busy-turned unique design dress, as if he was used to this upheaval.
The fair was primarily organised for the new owners, brand-oriented Russian buyers who are willing to go around after several hours of marketing a sandy, cifran decorated location, where they can find Cadillac Escaleds, platinum pocket knives, Mömenpick ice cream, usual billiard tables, dubai apartments and Gund Plüss bears.
For average people, the ticket costs 30 euros (44.57).
"The Russians like to know which brands are the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who has a patriotic view of the Dutch china manufacturer Royal Delft, compared to a wall-sized, hand-dressed, blue-painted Rembrandt imitation.
"The Russians, of course, are more interested in outstanding things."
Indeed, the sellers here said that the long time (based on Russian standards, this means 10-15 years) rich Russians have already separated themselves from the evasive logos to brands made in a limited number of bagatells that would not enter a commercial fair.
Yet, thousands of people, including millionaires, millionaires' agents and tourists spent the place all day in the middle of the day.
And some of them bought.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the director of the King Koil Bed Manufacturer, said that he sold two mattresses of silk, cashmere and cotton, each worth 70,000 dollars.
Also on the night of the first day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a salesman of A1 Moto, who was responsible for providing high-quality cars with a modern alarm, reported that his company sold the shiny orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire.
Andrei Karaptian, a luxury car manufacturer with unique needs, L.A. Connection President, sold three coolers to Rolls-Royce Phantoms on Sunday afternoon.
The reporters were also presented with wheels made for the owner of a Russian casino, which, according to Swarovski, was involved with crystals in order to create the appearance of a roulette wheel.
The price of a set of four pieces is $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather and pictures of his wife's face from a circus cube will not necessarily use these objects." said Karapetian.
"He's gonna keep them in the garage guarding 30-40 cars."
Despite the fact that many of its Russian clients are rich, Karapetian says that the term "Russian millionaire" is no big privilege these days, given the rapid rise in real estate prices there.
"Who bought real estate in Moscow four or five years ago, is probably a millionaire today, if not in cash, but at least on paper".
"There are more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least create the appearance of wealth in front of the Russian trustee of Alliance Continental.
The company has built four English-style telephone booths that have been accumulated with millions of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, told us that his team printed 500 thousand counterfeit banknotes to the Millionaires Fair.
Many visitors stopped to play with money, many took photos of themselves using a mobile phone, lying in the money ring, or just putting a few million in the pocket.
"See, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Karryev.
They suspect a surgical error behind a death in New Jersey.
The day before Thanksgiving, Ronald Livingston looked on the windows of a restaurant called "Just a Little Healthier" and saw an ambulance stop on Cape Cod two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
A police patrol car arrived shortly after.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the doctor's car stop," said Mr. Livingston on Wednesday, one of the inspectors at the restaurant.
"That's when I knew someone was dead."
The authorities found out that the dead woman was 41 years old, the name of Olga Arroyo, who used to work as a senior assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
The investigation is currently ongoing to determine whether death was caused by an unauthorized intervention by a cosmetic surgeon who had not been identified by the police, working under West Scott Avenue 212.
So far, the authorities have failed to find out what caused Arroya's death, but they are hoping that the results of the toxicology tests, which will be available in a few weeks' time, will reveal this mysterious death, which has affected high-ranking workers in the Newark Police Department with great pain.
Arroyo, whose voice was known to many in the department, has been working as an assistant to the police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006.
"He was loyal, diligent and reliable," she said in a phone interview about McCarthy Arroyo.
"..he was my housekeeper.
He was my protector."
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, currently working on the Sesparal Products Control Committee, as a police officer, and left two boys, 14 and 11 years old, as well as a stepdaughter.
Mr. Eileen Walsh, prosecutor of Union county, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives were working to find out if Mrs. Arroyo was the victim of an unlicensed surgical intervention.
"He's got a chance," Walsh said.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
Authorities report that they arrived at the house at 3 p.m. November
21st and Mrs. Arroyo was found on the couch.
He's already been declared dead at the scene.
It's been over a week and the police have told us very little about the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't tell me if Castro's been heard by the detectives.
The study participants are looking into whether part of the house was functioning as a medical clinic.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Castro's home, where there was a froze rosebomb in the narrow garden, and there was a Dalamata barking from the back of the house.
Next to the door to the basement, in the car entrance, there was a blue tank with the label "Etil Vanilin", which is used to replace vanilla in food and perfume.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks to side.
McCarthy recalled the first time that he arrived in New York after 25 years at the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was invaluable in helping him to cope with the unusual and unscrupulous political culture of the new city.
"He always said, "This and that will make him better to look after!" remembered.
"He was always here when I arrived in the morning, and he was always there when I left at night.
It was embarrassing."
The expectations of the Fed's interest cuts lead to the collapse of the world's stock markets
On both sides of the Atlantic, stock prices jumped yesterday, after the reassuring statements by the Vice-President of the Central Bank of America strengthened the hope that Fed will try to facilitate investment opportunities with additional interest cuts.
Stock markets both in London and in New York and across Europe have survived after Donald Kohn, who has declared the Fed President Ben Bernanke's right hand, has to respond "flexibly and pragmaticly" to the constant unrest in financial markets.
In addition to the clear objective of Kohn to calm down the markets in the midst of the resurgence of the credit crisis, he stated that the present unrest "has partly reversed the progress made on the market at the end of September and October".
He said that if the increased confusion persists, it could increase the possibility of further restrictions on the credit situation of households and companies.
The statements were interpreted by investors as ready to inject fresh capital into American markets or even further interest reductions in order to stabilise credit conditions.
The statements have also been soothing to Wall Street, which has recently been hit by several bad news about the American economy, such as the negative record of the number of American housing sales.
The negative effect of financial unrest was also confirmed by the announcement by Bear Stearns of the investment bank that, in order to compensate for losses in the US secondary housing sector, 650 workers and 4% of its global workforce as part of the cost reduction.
A total of 20 jobs are affected by this measure by the London Centre, which employs 1500 employees.
In New York, the average industrial index of Dow Jones increased by 331 points, 2.5 percent, and closed at 13.289,40 points, while the wider index of S&P 500 increased by 2.65%.
The FTSE 100 index in London increased by 165.5 points, 2.7 percent and closed at 6.306.2 and thus increased the value of British blue chip companies by more than 39 pounds.
The German Dax increased by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 by 2.3 percent.
Credit market unrest has been renewed since the three-month period since April 2001 at the high demand auction organised by the European Central Bank (ECB) has reached the European banks at a price of 4.7%.
After the interbank interest rate reached the highest level observed since September 12th of November, the Bank of England was under greater pressure to follow Fed and the ECB and to provide additional capital for the money market in London.
In England, the decision between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara is required.
He gave me two dilemmas, one more complicated than the other.
Who's to own the 6th edition of the English team in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And in the context of the first test against Sri Lanka, it's no less important who makes the decision?
The latter question is relevant, on the one hand, because David Graveney, the president of the candidates, who temporarily performs this particular task, will assist Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan in the decision-making process, and on the other hand because the English Executive Director Hugh Morris's desk account will be filled with requests for a national or at least a single selection post.
Among the two players draw the shorter one, which does not get the sixth place, but as well-known, life, and mainly sports are often unfair.
It's never easy to tell how you reach the top of someone's profession, while someone else can't get past a lower level.
It is not only the cricket that it is difficult to choose - often on a subjective basis - on a difficult basis.
Did the time come for Bopara to move forward?
Is it fair to see Shah if that happens?
The same question may also arise in other areas of life, for example, if we say John Edwards and "Tubby" Banerjee, two smart, highly qualified young leaders who know business would be put before decision-makers, while there is room for only one of them.
Who can tell which level is a cricket player without being thrown into the deep water in a more serious race?
Of course, data have a major impact on decision-making, but opportunities are equally important.
In a team, the player must have a look at the captain at the right moment in the cricket, and a batter should be given a chance on a regular basis if he wants to become a big player.
Catching the looks of the sorters is much more complicated.
For example, more people played better than James Anderson in the last season, but he still counts as a team member on the first test, despite Stephen Harmison's own statement that he's in good shape and that he's doing very well.
Anderson fought with 32 first-class gates and 33 runs to take part in the tour.
Chris Tremlett only hit 29, but both of them had successful moments on the highest level, and he hopes that they will be.
Whether Shah or Bopara will play at the Asgiriya Stadium, well, that will be decided on the basis of the opinions.
This decision may tear or break anyone's career, but it may not have a special impact on the future.
Four years ago Sri Lankan Gareth Batty played all the tests and performed well with five gates and 40 useful runs, yet Paul Collingwood, who was then emerging, became a prominent and decisive test critic, who may still be underestimated even today, despite obtaining a double hundred points against the Australians in Australia.
In their discussion in Asgiriya Stanion during today's game, listening to the conservative instincts of Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, Shah is likely to cast their votes against Bopara's young life force and dynamics.
There are arguments on both sides.
The bright and successful debut of the 88th Bombay test is in addition to Shah, who is seven years younger than Bopara's six, who also has excellent screws, he has reached 32 first-classers.
However, the fact that the Middlesex player Shah ran only ten against West Indies in two quarters at home in May in Lorda, and that Vaughan, who fought for his re-enactment in the next game, came to the immediate resistance of the pickers, seems to have reduced the perseverance that was clearly visible in Bombay.
In contrast to him, the universal talent of Essex is a life-long and unprecedented player.
There's nothing to be upset about in the cricket field, but his attitude beyond the field was well characterised when an exhibition with a four-wheel wheel of the team's motor sponsor Volkswagen.
Even so, the first thing he did was take over Vodafone's phone (naturally sponsored) and call his distant teammate Alastair Cook to ask him, "Have you seen this?"
Bopara is a better track player with classics. He develops a throwing angle that is beneficial for his congested medium steps, and his punches are confident and skilled.
Choosing the right person is one thing and another is the right moment.
Maybe it's a real art of choosing.
I'd personally give Bopara the chance now, which doesn't mean that I don't think Shah would offer a high priority if, as the tea leaves in Ceylon suggest, he'd be the one playing this weekend.
They're transporting the refugees home by bus to work and pick up the fight with Al-Qaida.
Since yesterday, the first buses to Baghdad from Syria have been arriving with the Iraqi refugees who have run out of money or have run out of visas, or actually those who hope the city is back in order.
There are also those among them who have returned to fight the soldiers who have dragged them out of their homes.
The bus station in Mansour was already full of refugees returning from Syria and Jordan before a government convoy of 800 people from Damascus filled with dozens of buses.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Dr. Sabah al-Quais.
"I came back today because I saw what happened on TV and in the papers in Baghdad and that the city is now safe.
"They say the Mahdi army stopped killing people," he added, referring to Mokanda al-Sadr's milisticist pastor, who has just stopped the Shiite's army.
The 38-year-old skiite teacher Qassim al Atwani from Amaryah, mostly a Sunniat, returned home with two children because he failed to renew his Syrian visa and because the regime there prevented the Iraqis from working.
The neighbours of the Amarija ski called him and urged him to return home, saying that the troops supported by the Americans were able to squeeze Al-Qaida out of their host in the western part of the capital.
One of Jordan's first arrivals was a Sunnite and Shiite tribal leader who escaped from a grenade attack at his home in Sleikh, northern Baghdad, when he began encouraging his fellow citizens to fight against Al-Qaida.
He's back to fight.
"Two days ago, my friends called me and told me they created an anti-Al-Qaida militia in Sleikh, and they needed support for me and my boys.
That's why I came back today," said the 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many have spoken of the fact that peace and armed civilian forces, which have been strengthened since the involvement of American troops in the capital, have attracted them home.
However, more were forced to return from Damascus because of visa - related and financial problems.
The 51-year-old, three-child Salaam al-Samarrai voiced a widespread view among refugees that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki asked the Syrian government to refuse the visa application for refugees to force their return.
It is believed that more than two and a half million people have escaped from the country's death squads.
"It was all right until Al-Maliki visited Syria and put pressure on the government so that it would not issue more visas to Iraqis in order to move them home," said the Sunnita pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned down my house after I ran."
One of the causes of the relaxation of violence was that the Sunnits were removed from the ski areas, while the skis left the Sunnitian residential areas, resulting in a decrease in tension in many regions.
Many people fear that the sudden appearance of refugees will upset the rocks again, which may even lead to new battles.
Kis Saarmaa - Native Training
The smallest federal province plays a leading role in vocational training and its higher education is internationally oriented.
There is only one training area where the island-rural people are faced with the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"Fiftieth time I explained to an island outside the island that we are not French" - this self-ironic slogan is being advertised on its posters on the occasion of the 50th birthday of the smallest federal state.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the education system in the Saarland region, which, based on the surveys carried out by the German Institute of Economics in Cologne (IW), boasts the fifth place.
In this way, higher education institutions, even because of tradition, are working closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Students here can complete their studies with two or even three degrees to date.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is high by 15.6 percent.
However, many of them do not have high-school education.
"They take advantage of the opportunities of vocational training in Saarland," explains Axel Plünnecke, an educational expert at the German Economic Institute.
Young people gain further education in more than one fifth of a vocational school, thus exceeding the federal average in Saarland by more than seven percent.
The combined opportunities for vocational and higher education have also been well developed.
The infrastructure for dual studies is in second place in Germany in terms of population numbers.
Despite practical training and increasing interest, however, the number of graduates has decreased by one third in recent years.
The Ministry of Education of the island therefore obliged higher education institutions to engage in a marketing campaign focusing on engineering sciences.
"In primary schools we have initiated many reforms following the first Pisa study," said a spokesperson of the Ministry of Education.
For this reason, the government has been conducting comparative tests across the country.
To allow children to start their studies earlier, the last year of kindergarten is free of charge. It is a model that, in the meantime, other federal provinces started to copy.
Whether the students' performance will improve permanently will only be answered by future comparative studies.
Based on the Pisa survey carried out in 2003, the proportion of students at risk narrowed from 29 to 20 per cent.
However, overall, the performance of the island area has not improved as far as the rest of the federal provinces.
Bajorans count better.
The greatest payback of the islanders in the Pisa occupation is not taken into account - otherwise, in this area they would be able to reap bakers,
Because the language of neighbouring countries is a mandatory subject in high schools - even if the islanders are not French.
Chavez Converts Watches
In Venezuela, in the near future, clocks are different from those in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez will turn the timeometers back half an hour in the country of Latin America.
Meanwhile, Chávez became a laughing stock in Spain.
As the official magazine of Venezuela stated, according to a new law, the clocks are reversed four and a half hours from the time of the Greenwich.
In this way, the South American state will be part of a time zone that is not used in any other country in the world.
Among other things, the anti-US Chávez justified his decision to force the United States of America's hours-based time zones to the world.
Chavez also announced on Wednesday (local time) the interruption of relations with neighbouring Colombia due to a hostage.
The nationalist politician on the left stated that until the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains President of Colombia, there will be no contact with the head of state or with the Colombian government.
"I cannot do this because of my own dignity," said Chávez, who calls for a constitutional reform, which the citizens of the oil country have to take an opinion on Sunday in a referendum.
By reform, it would build its power in the country.
The root cause of the debate was Uribe's decision to withdraw from Chávez his mandate to negotiate hostage release with the Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe decided to "arcul spit" Venezuela, gave his criticism of Chávez on Sunday.
Everyone in Spain is talking about Chavez.
In the country, a new mobile ringtone has come to notice: "Port quo no te callas" (Why you don't shut up), that's the sentence that more than half a million people have downloaded from the Internet.
The sentence comes from the King of Spain, John Károly, who, at the last summit in Latin America, was so upset by the constant protests of the populist politician in Balolda that he made his word.
The Germans are threatened by a reduction in wages in 2007.
A real wage reduction is forecast to threaten German workers this year, despite a strong climate.
Experts have supported their pessimistic predictions for a bunch of reasons.
According to the Hans-Bröckler Foundation's calculations, in 2007 employees could actually pay less than in the previous year.
"The reason for this modest wage development, the increase in general turnover tax and the rapid rise in food and energy prices", said Gustav Horn of the newspaper "Bild", a member of the Macroeconomic and Convent Research Institute.
There may also be another burden on workers in relation to unemployment insurance.
In his statement to the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung", Minister of Finance, Peer Steinbrück, said that in the current situation, the reduction of the correct and reasonable unemployment insurance to 3.3% at the beginning of the new year.
In all cases, the German Federal Labour Agency should not be put in a position to apply to the Alliance for credit or support, they quoted the German Social Democratic Party, the SPD politician.
It became known on Tuesday that the flooding of food and mineral oil products resulted in the highest inflation in 13 years.
In comparison, prices increased by a total of 3 percentage points per year.
Venus is the devil twin of the Earth
Despite the harsh atmosphere of Venus, it is more similar to the Earth than it has been assumed so far: in its atmosphere, the European "Venus Express" has discovered lightning discharges, and in its corners, it has discovered windmills such as those that occur in the winter on Earth.
For nearly three decades, scientists have assumed that Venus is flashing.
The European "Venus Express" space probe has provided evidence - it has discovered electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: the lightnings in Venus are spreading from cloud to cloud at a height of 56 km, reports Christpher Russel, an associate of Los Angeles California University in the stomachs of the Science magazine Nature.
According to the famous "cheese theory", the Earth life was caused by lightning: the theory is that the Zivatars launched reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
It's not like Venus: "If there's ever been a life there, it could have been in the very early days," explains Sean Solomon from the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Currently there can hardly be a living organism on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is 100 times denser than on Earth, and temperatures sometimes reach 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the devil's twin brother on Earth, but it's his twin brother," he nailed it with Russel.
The main question of the Esa mission is why Venus is so similar to Earth in mass and size on a completely different path of development.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone in Venus research, because since the early 90s, no probe has been on the road specifically to explore this planet.
According to researchers, the latest research results presented in several "Nature" articles show not only the uniqueness of the Venus solar system.
"They also point out that the likeness of the neighboring planet to Earth is greater than we assumed at first," Esa said.
In addition to the already known North Pole rolling wind, researchers also discovered an even faster-moving skyscraper in the South Pole.
The phenomenon reminds the air currents of the earth's winter hemisphere, says the research group led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The mass of the second inner planet of the solar system is almost the same as that of the Earth, and with a diameter of 12.100 kilometers it is almost the size of the Earth.
The celestial body, called the Evening Star, avoids the Sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much slower around its own axis: it takes 243 days a day on the ground.
Although the surface temperature of 460 Celsius, combined with the pressure of 92 bar in Venus, barely reminds the Earth, scientists are starting from the fact that both planets were created under perfectly similar conditions.
Both of them gathered water that remained on Earth as an ocean, while Venus left for the universe.
And while carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbon mats, Venus is a major part of the atmosphere.
Köhler's defending Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Mr Köhler, the President of the German Republic is calling for the conclusion of the debate between the parties which exploded around the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's office.
He was indirectly critical of the SPD's attack on the Chancellor after the September reception.
The German president of Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's authority and called for a large coalition to close the debate around the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not show ourselves as a divided nation to the outside world in this matter," said Köhler to the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler expressed his understanding of the fact that Chancellor Angela Merkel(CDU) had received the Dalai Lama in September.
" Human rights are universally valid for me, even if I respect the diversity between cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone is aware that Germany needs to take care of foreign policy's delicate balance, emphasised the President of the Republic; however, he has been accused of protecting Merkel against the fact that the Chancellor is pursuing a new Chinese policy.
"The Federal Chancellor did not break up with traditional "a Chinese" policy.
China is aware of this," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his disapproval of the Dalai Lama and therefore became the target of attacks in the Union.
Mr Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the EU's "scarrying policy" in the field of foreign policy.
Following the reception of Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's Office, severe disturbances occurred in German-China relations.
Thus, the Chinese leadership not only withdrew the invitation of the German Minister of Finance of Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to SPIEGEL, it also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the two countries.
Wen Jiabao, Chinese Head of State, has now called on the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that it was a mistake to receive the Dalai Lama.
China rejects the official acceptance of Tibetan religious leaders by European politicians, confirmed China's position in Wen Jiabao.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama pointed out that he was trying to break up Tibet and other Tibetan territories that include today's provinces.
Schäuble protects from disturbances such as those in France
Street collisions with the police, shootings, flaming cars: Wolfgang Schäuble protects from disturbances such as those in France.
Every effort must be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not discriminate against street violence, demands the Federal Minister of Interior.
Barricades were on fire, randomers fired a shotgun at the police: After the serious disturbance of young people in France, Wolfgang Schäuble, Federal Minister of Interior (CDU), in Germany, is concerned with similar developments.
"We must beware that the social explosives do not accumulate with us and that they do not turn into violence.
We have to take this seriously," said the newspaper "Neue Presse" in Hannover.
Not all youths adapt to rapid changes in social reality.
The alliance, provinces and communities are currently working intensively on solving problems, said Schäuble.
This does not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Islamic Conference, the first successes are already being closed."
However, it is too early to resolve the emergency.
Schäuble indicated at the same time that in the German suburbs there were no urban and sociological problems such as those in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris over the last night, young people have fought a serious street fight with the police.
In Toulouse there were also cars and public buildings.
In view of this, Kenan Kolat, the Head of the German Turkish Communities, required greater activity from the Federal Government in terms of integration.
In connection with the disturbances in France, Kolat warned about the "risks of imitation".
Although the situation in Germany is not as delicate as that in France,
Yet action is necessary.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people under the age of 25 from immigrant families was "higher than average".
Above all, more places of education should be provided.
Mr Kolat stressed: "We need to give young people a prudence."
However, the leader of the Turkish Community added that "social surveillance within the family" is more present in Germany than in France.
In addition, many young people from immigrant families do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat warns, "We still have to be sober."
Young people "must be given the opportunity to work and receive education as quickly as possible".
Meanwhile, in the suburbs of Paris, Villiers-le-Bel, there was complete rest during the night.
Hundreds of the police were ready for deployment, carrying a helicopter light bulb to the area.
The competent authorities have reported three arrests and some flaming garbage bags and cars.
Since the report, a security unit of 1000 people has been responsible for peace.
The police are ready to intervene as long as necessary, announced by Minister of Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie after his visit to the suburbs.
During the night on Tuesday, there were 80 policemen wounded in the ring as a result of the storms-le-belt riots.
The next night, the riots spread to Toulouse.
The revolutions occurred in a traffic accident, during which two young people lost their lives on Sunday.
The state's attorney's office's first findings show that the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
Clouding in Angela’s Empire
The action taken by the Chancellor in reality is proof that the coalition will end - and nothing is expected of him either.
Which country does the Federal Chancellor actually live in?
Following a vague, public and nothing-speaking action in the general debate of the Bundestag, it should be stated that it is not here - not in the country whose governance would be his responsibility.
With a very arrogant sentence, Angela Merkel refused to focus too much on foreign policy.
This is provincial, he replied, and in this way he just expressed himself that he did not want to understand what those who criticize him were talking about.
At the Federal Assembly, he made it clear to everyone how fitting the reproaches are.
In the meantime, neither concrete interest nor empathy was felt about the country's problems.
Instead, Angela the Clouder appeared: a real-time politician who flees to foreign politics and is only his own with uncertainty.
An example of climate protection: Heiligendamm's decision-making is unbridled, but he is silent about how the air conditioning targets should be achieved in the country.
At all, as far as self-esteem is concerned, such modesty would not have been allowed by the CDU's presidencies two years earlier.
Now he's obsessed with the fact that prosperity has a positive effect on people.
This harms the good news of a pragmatic person who solves problems instead of flowers.
However, in Angela’s clouding realm, domestic political problems are just side by side.
Child poverty and the problems of the low-income?
He's only saying this for a few words.
It is a lot to say in this regard how often it is a family substitute.
Merkel has to hold on three times to bring together a semi-peripheral sentence.
If it's specific, it's bouncing in a foreign area.
Class of seizure
During the debate held by the Republican presidential candidates at Youtube, the two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, were hit hard, and they must also be held by an external candidate.
The tension of the candidates has already surfaced on the first subject.
Mitt Romney tells his opponent, Rudy Giuliani, that he made New York a "rescue for illegal immigrants."
"I would say that his own house served as a refuge for illegal immigrants", he cuts back to Giuliani and throws it into the eyes of the former governor of Massachusetts, that he employed undocumented immigrants as a private person.
The candidates are about to start a seizure: Since the Republican camp still does not have a uniformly supported favorite, the eight presidents are using the debate on CNN to undermine their opponent's credit.
Internet users sent their own filmed 30-second videos via YouTube to just over short summarys.
"With this kind of isolacionism we have given Hitler power," says John McCain under the nose of his opponent, Ron Paul, who is the only one in the circle demanding immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney's head is also thoroughly washed by a vet in Vietnam who is reluctant to condemn the so-called "Waterboarding" as torture, the interrogation method in which the repression of water is simulated.
However, the fact that the important topics of the campaign are beyond Iraq and the debates on torture shows the reactions of St. Petersburg's audience in Florida.
There is a loud applause in the room when they praise conservative values and when they reject future tax increases.
Meanwhile, the weaknesses of the two candidates are becoming increasingly evident.
"At the time I was wrong," Romney regrets, and she apologizes to the supporters and TV viewers for putting her vote in 1994 with the suspension of pregnancy.
Giuliani, on the other hand, is indulging when she is asked for a literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf first governs as a civilian
One day after his withdrawal from the command of the army, the president of Musharraf, who exercised power in Pakistan was arraigned.
This will end eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, was elected for another five-year term on Thursday.
The Pakistani television broadcasts the ceremony live from the capital, the Islamic Presidential Palace.
Musharraf swore to the Constitution and that he would do the good of his people.
On Wednesday, he handed over his military headquarters to Ashfaq Kiyani, his confidant, and thus allowed international pressure from the United States.
Eight years after the former general broke into power without bloodshed in the form of a military coup, he now governs for the first time as a civilian head of state.
As commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf met a fundamental demand of the West and the opposition.
Another important claim is the abolition of the extraordinary condition which Musharraf announced on 3 November.
According to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will no longer end the state of emergency by which the West will meet a further demand.
The Supreme Court of the country in which Musharraf planted lawyers who sympathised with him at the beginning of November, following the publication of the extraordinary situation, rejected any protest in connection with the re-election of the Head of State on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four more were injured as a result of an attack on a military convoy in the tribe area on the north.
According to the military spokesperson's information, the bomb exploded on a road near the Afghanistan border.
Fathers of the Krautrock are returning
The German super team of the seventies is again playing music: The three band members of Harmonia have re-pored their instrument for a concert in Berlin.
On the occasion of the reassemble, a cut-off recording appears from the time of "Live 1974".
They were well known abroad at that time.
The reported sensation killed the body in the person of the three agreed gentlemen around the dinner table.
Before each of them his own instrument, his own cable and above all his own buttons.
Dieter Moebius in his 63-year-old white shirt is in the middle of a throne.
From left to left, Michael Rother, who is 57 years old, offers escorts in the possession of a laptop and guitar.
From the audience’s right hand side, the 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius curves and focuses on the console.
Each one of them is producing some kind of noise, and at one and the same time, it's a rhythm.
And sometimes all of this is made up of some randomly traditional music.
However, this does not seem to bother you gentlemen in particular.
It was a great excitement for those who liked the Krautrock musical direction that the Harmonia band was playing again.
What we can tell here is that as a result of an appropriate follow-up procedure, the name has passed through the collective pop-up, but in no case has left any permanent clues that we will miss this band painfully after 32 years.
But why can't the Germans celebrate the living legends of their 70s?
Especially that what we call misguided Krautrock has always been appreciated more in England and America than in its own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for Life in 2003 to the live members of the Cologne Can band, the German pop figures sat in the room with an unclear face.
When even La Dusseldorf and Neu! thanked the groups at the Red Hot Chili Peppers table, the wonders became limitless.
At the concerts, Michael Rother was sitting on the stage as an old friend of mine with Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Two sides of the same coin of domestic rejection and foreign acceptance.
The memory is overburdened by Harmonia because the trio existed only for two years, and during that time it had a far smaller effect than others had attributed to it afterwards.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with Conrad Schnitzler under the promising Cluster.
At first they played in the basement under Schaubühne Theatre in Berlin.
Then in Dusseldorf, for economic reasons, a record company funded by the church.
Roth helped the Kraftwerk band for a short time, and at the same time, perhaps the most radical German band, Neu! has gained a reputation as guitarist.
However, around 1973, Roth followed Cluster musicians into exile in Weserbergland Forst.
There, in Alter Weserhof, a 16th - century Rom lived as a communist who fled town.
Less ideologically than in Commune I, where Roedelius was still illegitimate as a babysitter.
Their lives are more like idyllic art.
It is said that the flag of Harmonia Ottenstein came out of the trash and that's how they found the name of their art.
Some things were recorded by the Harmonia.
The first album is called "Musik von Harmonia" and the next album is "De Luxe".
Despite his loose and modest music, the band suffered material needs.
The stockraiser alone didn't ensure a finding for themselves.
The CD, published in 'Live 1974', was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of an audience of only 50 people, so someone remembers.
The effort and occasional practice of Harmonia was then the idea of Rother.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this is an immoral demand.
The gang announced its division in 1975.
Roth ended up at esoterics and kept himself from albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster was revitalized in the eighties, which has since been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
The live album ingriessem is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record company, listening to the name Greenland, intended to take care of the Krautrock as a special German gift to live music.
In this context, Neu! has already been dug out as well as Roedelius's solo work.
The resurrection of Harmonia will take place at the House of Culture in Berlin.
In public, within the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, the author of our British ancestor and "Krautrock Sampler" is also present.
There's also Dr. Motte, the idea owner of Loveparade.
All of this broadly outlines the impact of krautrock on the next pop-music era.
In this regard, the Harmonia will fill the empty space reserved for the super team.
Brian Eno's finding, along with the most unusual sounds, is floating in the room: "The only true music, his future."
There are pictures of the producer in a peasant's room with Harmonia.
The production of further black and white photos of the kuza cabled equipment serves legend building.
The three veterans in the lobby are reimprovised by improvisation.
This simply means that microphones are attached to the organ and drumming equipment with the intention of misleading sound effects from the instruments themselves using their own escrowding effects.
Today, electrical music appears to be electrical music.
Three, technique-deeped ecclesiasticals.
All of this, even the house-school doesn't change anything.
Under Barbara Morgenstern's leadership, they cough and whistle and sing "Aaaaaaaah!" at a beautiful part.
Because krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
The roots were less sought in blues than in music colleges (Can), in technical knowledge (Kraftwerk), or in the escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
If anyone's calling out "68" here, they're not on the wrong road, and the Harmonia hasn't let you out of peace yet.
Even the most self-evident thing is carefully considered on the stage.
Where does the music start, and where does it end?
It can nerveally drive a person crazy, or it can offer it with the passing moments of extraordinary happiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough.
Through the hunt and the Mörderischer Frieden, two films deal with the Balkan war.
But none of them are convincing.
The basic idea is either too much for action and shooting, or too emotional.
Even Richard Gere can't help you with the hunt.
First of all, the good news is that although the two warring sinners Karajics and Mladics are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, they were found again in the dark background of the war in Bosnia, Richard Gere.
Recently, we have lost sight of the most beautiful man in the eighties, because the role of many good boys in emotional movies for women and the numerous press conferences on Buddhism have even taken our pleasure in looking at it.
And, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most impressive argument in addition to perhaps still watching the "Handing" movie.
It offers a wonderful and smiling performance: It is essentially the warwitness of Simon Hunt, which he has formed, that Gere could have become if fate and the film industry were not so kind to him: A man who left his beautiful years behind, but his decline in his ruinous monuments still preserved a significant part of his former appeal.
However, despite this broadcast, the German "Mörderischer Frieden" production of the film "Handing" and also started this week only continues the endless series of failed films of the Balkan war.
We do not have to waste much time on the "Mörderischer Frieden" film: the film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemel), who are saving a Serbian woman from the shootings in Kosovo, and one of them is suddenly in love with it.
Although it is to be welcomed that at this time the Serbs are not represented as the sole cause of all the bad ones, the film that carries the tenderness of television films is too quickly lost in the shooting and the eventful scenes.
"Cobra 11" is carrying a sign... instead of a freeway of war.
On the other hand, in the case of the 'Failing', it can be considered exemplaryly why no really good film has actually been made on the Balkan war.
The story of the three U.S. warwives who are turning up to find the Serbian war criminal listening to the name "Roka", with another director and other screenwriters (in both Richard Shepard's persoon union) might have become a new "Apocalypse Now" in another age.
For stories show a surprising similarity: In both cases small groups cut him into the forest to do what the army is unable to do - and in both cases the journey to madness is going on.
One of the reasons for the fall of the hunt is that he simply won't let Simon Hunt be the degenerate cynician who listens to his heart as he shows him at the beginning.
No, and in the script, he even spent a romantic relationship with a Muslim witch woman who was murdered later on.
The hunt is permanently slipping when the reporters reach what NATO, CIA and all the world's bounty hunters in five years, in the last five minutes of the film, have not been able to do: capture the war criminal and hand him over to the witches in Mozambique for fair revenge.
This is so bad that you'd rather go to the Hague International Criminal Court for the crime against the logic of cinema.
The film's purpose is deeply human.
He intends to claim that Karajics and Mladics are still on the loose and suspect the Americans and France (which is said to be exceptionally uniform) that, due to secret political agreements, they are not continuing to pursue the persecution intensively enough.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar to each other that you can think of a famous Brecht poem.
In this the poet writes about the mask of the Asian demon on his desk: "I am staring at the demise of the demise which tells me how tiring it is to be bad".
Movies such as "Handing" have the same oversized, human-shaped masks, which, however, show how tiring it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the work of the Balkan war films.
Recently, they reported in the paper that all the films about Iraq in Hollywood were a nasty fall.
We can add: there are still no good films in South Africa.
Almost always valid: If a star wanders through the world's crisis or mine fields, it goes like "In the Ways of Freedom" with Patricia Arquette, Angelina Jolie without Borders or Leonardo Di Caprio with Blood Diamond.
It is possible that these conflicts are just too close to time.
They had to spend decades shooting a good movie about the Holocaust with the "Schindler's List" film.
Some films are likely to be worth it - because today's classical works about Vietnam's war, such as the deer hunter, the "Apocalypse Now" or the "ful Metal Jackett" were not celebrated unanimously in their time as a masterpiece.
But it may be that today, when all mass killings arrive in real time, right through two screens, we simply know too much about world conflicts.
And it deprives screenwriters of ignoring reality, which is necessary to tell good stories.
After all, 'To fly or not' or 'The dictator' have managed to do so well because Lubitsch and Chaplin have not yet known how terrible the Nazi regime really is.
Maybe you shouldn't do the right thing if you want to make a good movie.
Maybe we need to get into the sarcasticly remote artistic view of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When his historical novel "The Lemprière-lexicon" and the parallels between the Balkan war, he replied, "It only depends on certain things never change.
Large cities will always be terriblely dangerous, people will always be killed in terrible ways, and war will always prevail in Yugoslavia."
Von Beusto is highly criticised for resigning the Olympics.
The mayor's departure from Hamburg's proposal to organise the Summer Olympic Games caused intense criticism in political and economic life.
A lot of people want to keep fighting for water games.
Von Beust, however, is a strong warning to reality in the face of the odds.
On Wednesday, the head of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, declared the withdrawal to be "no part of the economic environment".
No other project has recently released such huge motivational forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
"With this aim in mind, we would not be able to maintain a level playing field in sport policy."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to draw up a long-term initiative "on the basis of modified time coordinates".
Mayor Ole von Beus maintained his previous statements that Hamburg's ambitions for the Olympic Games were not realistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on the Olympic tender, but the German Olympic Sports Association", said von Beust to WELT ONLINE.
Following the decision of the Sports Association in early December of 2018 from the Munich tender for the Winter Olympic Games.
"To give this preference to us means that we will not have any real chances within the period we have thought of until 2028."
However, we do not give up the dream permanently, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) expressed regret over von Beus' statements.
This gives the impression that Hamburg will not apply for Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to shoot a chance by burying our plans", said Günter Ploß, president of HSB on Wednesday.
Moreover, the withdrawal from the application is contrary to the statement made by the Senate President at the General Assembly of the General German College of Sports.
There Von Beust Hamburg's 2015 Universaliadér tender described that it was not a substitute for the Hamburg Olympic Games.
The College Sports Association only launched Hamburg as a city participating in the competition last week.
The civilian group of the SPD has told the Senate that it has left no valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"Kleiner Grasbrook has been postponing the development of the Senate for years because he was standing next to the Olympics and not building the apartment," said two SPD representatives, Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD continued to break the spear in the context of Kleiner Grasbrook with the integrated plan for the Olympic and later residential exploitation, the CDU unilaterally focused on the "event factor".
The 2012 Summer Olympic Games tender brought great enthusiasm to Hamburg.
However, Hamburg's Lipcshen failed.
They're not Warhol's crates.
Who connects the concepts of Sweden and the wall, it's Ikea, and it's not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, walls produced in Sweden cast a dark shadow on the list of works of Warhol.
The ninety-four "Stockholm Type" Brillo Box is a major part of a forgery.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the originality of the Brillo Boxes of Andy Warhol in 1968, now the internal investigation of the Moderna Museum in Stockholm has come to an outstanding conclusion: Pontus Hultén, former museum director, has donated six "Brillo Box" copies to Moderna Museet in 1995 - and most likely it is a hundred more "Stockholm-type" Brillo Boxs on the wheels on the international art market.
The history is a confusing chain of long and complicated artistic and curatorial stunts.
Warhol created the first painted falades of Brillo's Boxes in New York in 1964, based on the red-and-white form of "Brillo" soap carton.
At an exhibition held in 1968 in Moderna Museet, with Warhol's consent, hundreds of Brillo crates were made out of cardboard: they were not from Warhol (for cost-saving reasons), but were transported directly from the Brillo cartel factory.
It wasn't about art works, it was about their templates, they were about simple exhibitions.
At the same time, Warhol authorised the production of some of the Brillo Walls in Sweden in 1968, which were not, however, issued in Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the age are now talking about 15 boxes that entered the art and auction history of the original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box then certified.
Some of them were auctioned for over $100,000.
The problem, however, is that Pontus Hultén, the legendary museum director later on, was wrongly claimed that in 1968, hundreds of walls were produced and produced in Sweden, which he then left for Warhol.
In fact, Hultén's 105 crates were only manufactured in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in Szent-Pétervár.
At that time, however, Warhol was dead three years ago.
Lars Byström, the main monumental caretaker of Moderna Museet, has also examined three private Swedish boxes, two of which were made in 1968 in Stockholm, near the six Brillo Boxs owned by the museum.
The structure of the copies from 1990, on the other hand, tells us that the paint was applied directly to the sheet without any foundation, and that it was not oil but acrylic paint.
"These boxes are not certified by the artist, so they should be deleted from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo's Boxs," says Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museum: "Unless the New York "Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board" decides otherwise, the Moderna Museet will be classified as a copy/out of six boxes in his collection."
The Authentication Board, of course, already announced in June that it would investigate "severe charges" in relation to soap powdered boxes.
Since then, however, they have been covering themselves in unsolicited silence.
Manila rebel soldiers give up
They gave up the rebellion in the Philippines by the soldiers who barricaded themselves at a hotel in Manila and demanded the defeat of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He can't take responsibility for the bloodshed, has declared to reporters at the hotel their leader, Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud.
Before that, the hotel was rushed by government soldiers who took gas of tears.
Two dozen soldiers have barricaded themselves in the building for hours.
Half of the team was court-martialed on Thursday due to the failed coup attempt in 2003 - including Trillanes.
