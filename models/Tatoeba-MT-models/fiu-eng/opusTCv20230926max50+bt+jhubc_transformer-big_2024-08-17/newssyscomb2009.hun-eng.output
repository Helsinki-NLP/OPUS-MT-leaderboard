Right-wing populists win in Austria, a total of 29%
According to the first preliminary results, Austria’s early parliamentary elections on Sunday brought about a noticeable weakening of the two parties of the previous grand coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, was seriously shaken, suffered a particularly heavy loss.
In contrast, the President of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), the Provincial Governor of Carinthia, J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider, is preparing a victorious return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the Social Democratic Party (SP<0xC3><0x96>) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8% of the votes, but lost 5.5% of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP was even worse, losing nearly 9% of the vote by 25.6%.
These are the worst results achieved so far by both major parties in Austria’s post-war history, and the result is literally disastrous, especially for the People’s Party, which triggered early elections.
At the beginning of July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP left the coalition, the EPP had a significant advantage over the SP<0xC3><0x96>, according to opinion polls.
However, the voters apparently punished him for allowing the government to fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results, there were speculations about the possible resignation of party leader Wilhelm Molterer and the current Vice-Chancellor.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party presidency.
This development would probably facilitate the increasingly likely way out of the election result, i.e. the renewal of the SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP grand coalition.
In view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Austrian Freedom Party (FP<0xC3><0x96>) obtained 18 percent of the votes and the BZ<0xC3><0x96> gained 11 percent of the votes in 2005 - the Social Democrats, at the same time, expressed their fears about the repetition of the EU sanctions in 1999, when the People's Party agreed to co-governance.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and I assume that he can return to national politics in Vienna, obviously expects this solution.
The Green Party also entered the parliament, but it lost some of its popularity and fell from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties exceeded the four-percent threshold and did not enter parliament.
Schwarzenberg: India's relations could be cold
According to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, if the problem of the illegal collection of beetles could not be solved, a certain estrangement could occur in Czech-Indian relations.
The minister said this in New York after a meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherji, today.
"If this were not resolved, then yes, there would be a certain estrangement," he said after the meeting, which took place under Czech encouragement.
After the trial, Mukherji said it was difficult for the executive to intervene in court cases.
He mentioned, however, that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>vácha, who had been acquitted and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local administration in Darjeeling, whose legislation covers the matter.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, who has been sentenced to three years in prison, said it would be best for him to appeal to a higher court.
Then he could apply for bail and wait for the verdict, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had expressed himself in a similar manner during the trial.
"He offered to appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to acquit him," the chief of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech party can intervene in the whole case is to provide the convicted person with "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
However, he said that the Indian side already provides them with such assistance.
“Our main interest with India is to maintain the best relations with many years of tradition.
The Indians recognize this, too," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told <0xC4><0x8C>TK, he emphasized to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
“We consider it a serious mistake to imprison and prosecute these Czech scientists,” he said.
When asked whether the Indian side had promised to deal with the matter, the minister avoided answering.
"I've already received quite a lot of promises," he noted.
Czech judges in the fight for the seabed
He steps up to the walled electronic map showing Australia and neighboring marine areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a point disappearing in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the neighboring seabed.
The area is as big as the continent itself,” says Luigi Santosuosso, an Italian lawyer who is part of the UN’s Ocean and Law of the Sea team of 30 lawyers.
His boss, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, the director of the division, follows the explanation, which is sometimes supplemented.
There is enthusiasm and enthusiasm here.
The seabed hides a world rich in natural resources, little known until now.
Oil, ore and other minerals can be found here, but so far also unknown living organisms, which may be the key to the development of anti-cancer drugs, for example.
Larger than land seabed
The coastal states are now intensively applying for new undersea areas.
According to the United Nations Convention, they are exercising their rights, which was agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is primarily the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
Such a country shall have exclusive rights under the Convention to all the sources of the continental shelf.
"To put it simply, we consider that part of the seabed and the bottom layer of the continental shelf that is the natural continuation of the seabed.
It extends beyond the borders of the coastal sea, often 200 nautical miles beyond the so-called exclusive economic zone,” Mikulka explains.
The request, submitted by a country to the Commission for the External Borders of the Continental Shelf, should be accompanied by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of costly research and measurements.
This is the result of many years of preparatory work.
“One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the committee.
The Commission has so far examined five applications, including those from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful," Mikulka adds.
Australia’s recent success has been the first to significantly expand its sub-continent.
But New Zealand also won - the seabed area awarded to it by the commission is about 1.6 million square kilometers, that is, six times the size of the country's territory.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in research.
The profits from future use of the seabed will, they hope, be incalculable.
Other countries are also submitting their applications on a regular basis.
They can do so within ten years of the moment of the ratification of the "Montego Bay Agreement".
Where the continental pedestal ends, the ocean floor area declared by the treaty to be the “common heritage of humanity” begins.
No country has an exclusive status here.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by the international institution established by the Convention.
“The seabed, however, is not Klondike,” says Director Mikulka, exaggerating that “some areas are legally clearly delineated and their regime is contractually fixed.”
Czechs in the Pacific
Today, part of the seabed belongs to the Czech Republic.
This is shared with other countries of the former Eastern Bloc in the framework of the joint "Interoceanmetal" organization.
This organization was granted the so-called “pioneer investor” status under the agreement in 1991, similarly to investors of some other countries.
It is licensed to grow in the ClarionClipperton zone between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean.
The area inspected by the investor is slightly larger than that of former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it is a kind of undersea copy of the Tatras.
"These can be cultivated on a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich source of polymetallic ores containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says another lawyer, Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian associate of the division, presents another example of a concretism.
It resembles a potato or, with a little imagination, a parchment with magic words that bring Golem to life.
German special forces were present at the release of the hostages
The Egyptian government asked Germany for help in solving the hostage crisis - and the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but they were not deployed.
More and more details are coming to light about the release of the 11 European tourists kidnapped in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Interior, German special forces were indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to this, in addition to the specialists of the German Federal Army, the employees of the GSG 9, the German Federal Police Airfield, the Federal Criminal Office, as well as logistics experts of the German Technical Service were also at the site of the release.
According to information provided by ministry spokespeople on Monday evening, however, the German forces were not needed, as the hostage-takers let their prisoners run and then fled when they recognized signs of a violent hostage rescue.
The Egyptian government has accepted Germany’s offer of assistance in order to involve it as a support force on the ground.
"Fortunately, this did not happen," a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
The group, which consisted of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and eight Egyptian escorts, was abducted in southern Egypt on September 19.
Following the kidnapping in the desert area of southern Egypt, the hostages were taken to and fro in the border areas of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage-takers has remained unclear, as have the details of the hostages' release and possible ransom payments.
The survivors arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
In Berlin, no information has been provided as to when they will return to Germany.
According to the daily newspaper "Bild", the five tourists and special forces will arrive in Germany on an Airbus plane on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the bailout.
The U.S. House of Representatives passed a $700 billion bailout for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones plunged into the depths.
The U.S. House of Representatives voted 227 to 206 to reject the government’s bailout for the financial markets.
Despite calls from U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, the program failed to gain a majority in favor of curbing the chaos in the financial markets.
Supporters have made a desperate attempt to convince critics of the need for the $700 billion package in a dramatic action.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic Party’s chief negotiators, called for support, even if the plan was unpopular.
“It’s hard to get political support to avoid something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
The Dow Jones fell more than 6 percent and 600 points during the vote.
Investors were concerned that the bailout plan might fail.
The index rose shortly before the end of the vote, and then plummeted again after a failure was made public.
Experts expect further severe turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the program to enter into force, both the House of Representatives and the Senate must approve it.
Managers are registering more and more bookings.
It’s a good winter for German tour operators.
According to a study, traffic for the coming months increased significantly compared to the previous year – by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak outlook for economic activity, the study found that the German appetite for travel did not wane.
The German Travel Association (DRV) said on Monday that travel agencies saw a 31% increase in their winter bookings compared to the previous year.
According to the GfK market research institute, the number of bookings in the autumn months is even higher.
The turnover of travel agencies in October was 11 percent higher than in October 2007, the DRV said.
These results are based on GfK data, which evaluates the monthly booking data of 1,200 German travel agencies and then extrapolates it to the entire market.
The Institute took into account the trips booked until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, trips to the US are particularly in demand, the DRV said.
Here, the number of reservations increased by a third.
Germany’s most popular destinations are Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as its domestic landscapes.
“Organised routes are the most sought after,” said Klaus Laepple, president of the DRV.
Due to rising energy and food costs, organized travel costs can be "calculated better for passengers than for individually organized travel."
Passengers can save money with pre-booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple added.
The booking rate for the summer months was also very good, so it will be possible to book an increase in traffic again compared to the previous year - although according to another study, fewer German tourists undertook travel compared to the previous year.
The First Oktoberfest
Repetitive ballermann hits, liter jars of beers and celebrities wearing a design dirndl.
Debut at Wiesnen.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't really look alike.
She's blonde, she's a TV host, and she wears a tailor-made dirndl.
My hair is dark, I'm a schoolgirl, and I bought my dress at the mall.
But one thing unites us: We’ve been at Wiesne for less than three minutes, we’re already being rushed by photographers and loaded with memory cards – all very flattering, and all this on my first visit to Wiesne.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to have served its purpose.
As a Wiesn tourist to the north of the equator made of white sausages, my sense of comfort is still limited by the traditional costumes.
But by the time you get to Theresienwiese, it's not so bad.
Almost everyone wears a dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed – everything is perfectly fine.
The only weird look at the chocolate banana stand is my dirndl apron.
A woman from Munich points out that I tied the apron wrong: "You are free, tied to the left, a virgin in the middle, sold out to the right, a widow in the back."
I secretly tied the bow from the back to the left.
"That's good," he says, and laughs.
Others make less fuss around subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt-tip hats with the words "I'm too drunk to dress up" and unsolicitedly show their naked butts.
The young man with exhibitionist features is called Bob, and he also visited Oktoberfest for the first time.
Which he finds very fantastic, prolonging the "aaaaa" for a long time.
He tells me all this after he's gotten rid of the contents of the jug he drank earlier.
Right next to one of the fire hydrants that everyone looks at as a garbage can.
So Bob's one of the infamous "forbidden urinals."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At around 8 p.m., ambulances flock to the scene to take care of the poor.
The nurses always appear in a team - four of them carry a covered stretcher from tent to tent at the same time.
This works like most Wiesn visitors: Arrival empty, departure full.
Who's in the alcohol box under the tarp, you can't tell.
"These are the ones who are completely ready," one of the medics yelled at me at my question, and then in the whirlpool.
Police named the victim of the accident
Police have named a 63-year-old woman who was hit by a vehicle in Essex County and died at the hospital.
Carole Paulson, a resident of Chelmsford Road, Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon at Shenfield Road in the city.
He was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey's Expanding Diplomatic Horizon
Long before Turkey intended to join the European Union, European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps only 20 steps from the European border, stands one of the greatest relics of the failed imperial quest.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed in Neo-Renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that's what the travel books say.
The building surrounds the end of the platforms, with one tower at each of the front corners, and looks like some kind of German country town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is a little dilapidated.
However, looking inside the vaulted ticket office, it is obvious what a grand enterprise this was the westernmost gate.
The station was opened by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation in August 1908.
Germany, the “late future” of conquests, wanted to use this railway from Damascus to Baghdad to present-day Saudi Arabia to realize its ambitions to conquer the Middle East.
The German conquest efforts collapsed during World War I.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab partisans.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The British colonial army withdrew from Egypt and drove the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
Hyderpasha station was no better.
In 1917, an ammunition train exploded and destroyed the beautifully crafted roof of the building.
According to Turkish sources, a sabotage operation was carried out.
Since then, it has slowly decayed and history has far surpassed it.
At the same time, today, as the gateway to the railways towards Anatolia and the entire eastern region, at least symbolically, it serves as Turkey's expanding diplomatic horizon.
The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has developed a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The new policy is marked by commitment.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian groups of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq, with Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to assess the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I took the night train to Ankara, the capital of Turkey, to visit Suat Kiniklioglu, one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish MP.
The next morning, after about ten and a half hours of thumping, which also gave me the rhythm of the famous documentary about the old world, "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital. The new city is intended as a symbol of the new secular state, which turns its back on the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, which is known to have Islamic roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
This raised some suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
I took a taxi to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern, stone-and-steel, purpose-built building - located in a developing suburb, between half-finished shopping malls and coffee houses. In the latter, middle managers in suits - both men and women - meet to make a deal early in the morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have been a right- and middle-minded politician in any other European country.
He was wearing a suit, a tie, and I'm sure he even had a Blackberry.
“The party’s foreign policy objective is to help Turkey reintegrate into its immediate environment.
The Cold War has disrupted order,” he said.
Turkey is isolated from its hinterland.
Today it had to face east and west at the same time.
He didn't get to choose between the two.
They had to open in both directions.
"But is it possible that sooner or later he will be forced to choose?" I asked.
"Turkey never wanted to face a choice."
He then stressed what almost everyone I have spoken to here has almost mechanically repeated: Turkey’s relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the countries surrounding the Black Sea, benefit Europe and the United States as much as Turkey itself.
It is as if they are trying to convey the message that, metaphorically speaking, along with Turkey, the whole of Europe can reach Asia and the Middle East on those eastward railway lines.
When I was at Hydarpasha station again, after another night, mostly awake, I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, the two German gentlemen who watched the construction of this ornate structure 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East are now largely in the hands of Turkey.
And as I waited at the port for the ferry to take me back across the Bosphorus, I remembered that at the time Turkey was called “the sick man of Europe.”
At that time, there was no question as to which continent would claim this exciting country.
Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes that Vernon "Tod" Handley (born 11 September 1962) has led the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir as the Guildford Music Director.
Based on his musical plans for the area, he founded his wonderful youth choir Proteus the following year.
In principle, only those under the age of 21 could have belonged to the choir, but when Proteus sang its finale in 1979 - many of us were in our late 20s - we simply refused to part with the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the name of the mythological shape-shifter) was in line with the choir's determination and ability to cope with any score that was placed before it - be it a madrigal or a Messiaen piece; without accompaniment, or accompanied by a large orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir has often been amazing and always exciting, and we owe it to the person for whose inspiration our enthusiasm for music has remained unchanged over the years.
How often did Tod tell us to "let the music speak for itself"?
He always said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the score.
So sing it!"
His technique as a conductor was always perfectly understandable and precise, but never dictatorial or excessive.
No matter how good the music was, he was always uplifting.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If there ever was a choirmaster who should have been knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
In the past 40 years, I have written reviews of more than 100 of his concerts, but he has never disappointed me with any of them and often inspired me with them.
Tod Handley had greatness and modesty together, which is very rare.
He hated the conductors who, in his own words, simply "galled around the world with one or two well-known battlehorses."
Many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to your obituary of William Woodruff (September 25), "He continued his studies of economic history at Oxford in 1946, and in 1950 he received a scholarship from the Houblon-Norman Research Institute...while constantly preparing for his bachelor's, master's and PhD degrees."
This is from the author's notes on Woodruff's Beyond Nab End, but it's wrong.
Between 1946 and 1953, he taught economics at the University of Nottingham and, under the leadership of Professor J. D. Chambers, completed his PhD on the British rubber industry, which he then published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry".
In 1950-51, he did indeed reside in the United States on a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, New York, and Harvard.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It’s not clear why Woodruff was beautifying this period of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Humanities
"I recommend J. Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco and Life" because his black-and-white, documentary style photos are impressive.
Their simplicity and power, as well as their respect for the people in the photographs, attracted my attention.
This exhibition is filled with emotions.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
A second sales record for Honda.
In November, Honda will begin selling the second generation of Jazz.
It is true that its predecessor already had a large enough passenger area, but the interior of the new model is even more spacious.
All this is combined with sophisticated mechanics that make driving more comfortable and increase fuel savings.
Evolution vs. Revolution.
This is what the second generation of Honda Jazz looks like.
Although the new Jazz looks very similar to its predecessor, a number of internal changes have been made.
These include innovative design, new bodywork, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
But before we get into the details of the new model, we have to say that the new Jazz was released six years after the first generation was launched.
So, first of all, we can say that Honda managed to renew this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
Jazz is less well-known in Europe, but it is breaking sales records in other markets.
Such a market is Japan, where Jazz was the most popular car brand in 2002 and again in 2008.
In Japan, for example, almost one million jazz pieces have been sold since its launch.
The second market was the Old Continent, with nearly half a million copies sold in six years.
However, with the new Jazz, Honda wants to further increase traffic in the region.
That is, while in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Jazz cars, by 2009 the target is to sell an estimated 100,000 cars, which would result in a 17% growth in the European market.
Since 2002, Honda has sold 8,000 Jazz cars in the Spanish market, accounting for 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
In the case of the new generation, the managers of the Spanish subsidiary are calculated on the basis of 2000 copies sold within a year.
What’s more, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly ease Honda’s decline in traffic in Spain.
The company expects to sell 22,000 copies by the end of this year, which is 4,000 fewer than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite sales conditions, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
By 2010, this figure will also be increased to 2%.
Honda hopes to achieve this by introducing a new model.
This would be the Insight, a five-door, compact-size hybrid with a length of 4,370 mm, of which the Japanese company would sell 200,000 units worldwide each year.
According to the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight's market share would be held by the United States, while the rest would be held by the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is due in the first months of the year after the official launch in Valencia, scheduled for January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has become more spacious in every way.
Its length reaches 3900 mm (five centimeters longer), its width is 1690 mm (two centimeters wider), and the wheelbase is increased by five centimeters, that is, 2500 mm.
Its height remains unchanged at 1520 mm.
In addition to the dimensions, the passenger compartment has also become more spacious.
The larger interior is guaranteed on the one hand by the new body and on the other hand by the fuel tank in the middle – a solution that we already know from the previous Jazz.
In addition, the so-called double-floor trunk’s total cargo volume has increased, currently 399 litres, i.e. 19 litres more than the capacity of the first generation.
This includes the 1.4-engined version, as the 1.2-litre Honda Jazz has a 379-litre boot.
Some exterior modifications can also be discovered, such as rear led lights or an optional panoramic glass roof, as well as easier access to the rear seats.
In addition, the opening angle of the doors for the rear seats was raised to 80 degrees, as opposed to the 67-degree opening angle of the front Jazz.
The engines of the second generation Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its distribution, this small model is available with two engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Thanks to i-VTEC technology, both engines consume more power than the previous model and are characterised by lower CO2 emissions and excellent mechanical compatibility, while at the same time the engine delivers outstanding performance in every respect.
The 1.2-liter engine has a power output of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm and a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine, which had 78 hp in the previous Jazz, consumes 5.3 liters and emits 125 grams of CO2.
The other engine, which produced 83 horsepower in the previous generation, now reaches 100 horsepower.
The 100 hp 1.4 Jazz consumes an average of 5.4 liters and emits 128 grams of CO2.
The "Honeymoon"
For the development of accident prevention technology, Nissan took inspiration from nature, specifically the world of bees, for its new invention.
The Japanese company has designed a robot that imitates the flight of bees to avoid accidents.
The Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, may be the first step in the development of collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Engineering Center, in collaboration with the renowned University of Tokyo’s Advanced Science and Technology Research Center, have built this little robot in Japan.
Kazuhhiro Doi, Brand Director of Technology PR and Research Development, defines the BR23C as a further extension of Nissan’s four-tier safety envelope.
The robot enhances the collision avoidance capability of the company’s products.
During flight, each bee forms its own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety cover.
Much more important, however, is the complex eye of the uterus, which sees at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions. Consequently, the uterus can fly undisturbed in its own personal space.
To replicate the function of the compound eye, the engineers designed a so-called laser range finder.
In front of the BR23C, the instrument detects obstacles up to 2 metres in front of the BR23C, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which is immediately converted into a collision avoidance operation.
“As soon as the obstacle is detected, the small robot immediately changes direction by imitating the movements of the bee by moving the wheels at a smaller or larger angle to avoid collision.
The main difference between the system and the currently available instruments is that in this case the bypass manoeuvre takes place completely automatically.
If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the detour cannot be directed upwards or downwards, nor can it move diagonally, but only in two dimensions, and only in the direction of the turning of the wheels, that is, not in an infinite direction and way, as is the case with bees.
Therefore, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, Nissan has implemented a rotation function in the robot to avoid collisions.
“This device only needs to process and respond to data every few seconds.
There is no need for data storage or intuitive logic based on previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruption with just a few dozen KB of memory.
This may sound surprising, but we’re not talking about gigabytes, or even megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in the development of instant collision prevention technology, which Nissan estimates could be introduced to production vehicles within ten years.
The robot is powered by lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion version.
In the future, the integration of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system could be an additional application to get the driver to their destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Fear of Mortgages
We have to admit that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having plenty of cash to invest, lacks common sense.
Because of the crisis on their backs, and to prevent the Americans from getting entangled in the labyrinth of questionable mortgage banks, they created a fun and informative online game called “Bad Credit Hotel”.
It's the hotel of bad loans... the galibas.
The gloomy appearance of the accommodation, and especially the receptionist, suggests that we should think again, twice, or even three times, whether the time for borrowing really has just come.
And above all, where to apply for credit, since this is probably the purpose of the thing.
The information on the website is useful, but not very detailed.
It's more for teenagers than the general public.
But what would happen if we complemented the game?
For example, the room of our dreams would appear in the hotel.
In fact, it is something, because we do not dare to dream of buying a home...
Morgan Stanley Opens Its Capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced a stake in Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). The largest Japanese bank is paying $9 billion for 21% of the company’s capital after Morgan Stanley shares plummeted in the stock market.
A week after the pre-agreement was announced, the two banks said MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s ordinary shares at a unit price of $25.25, or $3 billion in total.
The agreed price is more than 19% below the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG invests an additional $6 billion in convertible securities, which provide it with a 10% return and an exchange rate of $31.25.
According to Morgan Stanley, the global transaction will be executed at an average exchange rate of $29, which is 28% higher than the current exchange rate.
However, Morgan Stanley's stock price fell by 6.79% at 5 p.m. GMT, closing at $23.07.
“This strategic alliance offers Morgan Stanley a great opportunity to accelerate its transformation into a bank holding company,” said John Mack, CEO of Morgan Stanley.
Morgan Stanley approved the new status last week, which allows it to diversify its activities, while at the same time coming under the control of the Federal Reserve.
The agreement with MUFG reaffirms that the current financial crisis requires even greater caution from corporate giants listed on Wall Street.
The terms announced on Monday also show that the agreement has been amended in recent days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that it will sell 20% of its shares to the Japanese company for about $8.5 billion.
“A week ago, we thought that the share would consist entirely of ordinary shares,” said Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG in Tokyo.
"However, given the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimise and avoid potential risks."
In terms of weighted average price, MUFG pays 7% more than book value for Morgan Stanley shares.
As a result of the transaction, the return per share is reduced by approximately 20%.
Under the agreement, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into ordinary shares in one year’s time if the latter’s trading price exceeds the exchange rate by more than 50% over a specified period, i.e. it rises to approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley thus ensures that with funds from MUFG, you can take advantage of your investment opportunities, improve your balance sheet and increase your liquid resources.
A spokesman for the group, however, did not want to give precise information about the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the merger of MUFG, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its Tier I solvency ratio by about 15%, making it one of the best in its sector.
Morgan said its balance sheet had "decisively" improved since the end of August.
The past few weeks have been a great ordeal for the group, as the price of its shares has fallen by half, while the cost of its insurance against non-payment risk has skyrocketed.
This cost decreased on Monday, but remained at a high level of around 12%.
Only one “survivor” of the big investment banks remains after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. This is Goldman Sachs, which announced last week that it had received $15 billion: part of which comes from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group of companies.
Statement by Rafael Correa, Quito
The reconstruction of the republic in the spirit of 21st century socialism.
This is the joint plan of Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, Evo Morales of Bolivia and Rafael Correa of Ecuador.
Following the example of his fellow presidents and friends, Correa set out his vision for the new constitution on Sunday.
He fulfilled his mission successfully, as 64% of the voters voted in favour of the referendum, according to the official results, which applied to 80% of the votes.
According to this, 28% of the population voted no, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% of them were cast uncompleted.
50% + 1 vote was required for the adoption of the draft Constitution.
On Sunday, two polls at the polling stations and a count by a non-governmental organization showed a massive majority of "yes" votes, with 63% and 70%, respectively.
Rafael Correa has already spoken about the victory of his draft constitution on the night of Sunday to Monday.
"The Constitution has been a landslide victory," he said, thanking the Ecuadoreans at Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As is well known, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez, Morales and Chilean President Michelle Bachelet.
According to a report by the Organization of American States (OAS) observation mission, the vote took place in a relaxed atmosphere. The main topic was a text with 444 points summarizing the principles of the "new socialism" defended by the president.
The proposed constitution places state power at the service of the economy, while the state reserves the right to “plan development” for a country that basically lives off oil production by foreign companies and foreign exchange sent by emigrants.
Correa’s 2006 draft constitution also strengthens the power of the head of state, who can obtain a mandate for a maximum of two consecutive terms and has the right to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he wants to make use of this opportunity, and in February 2009 he will once again compete for the presidency.
The president has already started to implement this in his country, which has a population of 13.9 million, and half of the population lives below the subsistence level.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country, which could put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of the Ecuadorian facility that is the basis for US anti-drug measures.
19 hostages freed in Chad
An Egyptian commando attacked the kidnappers, who took 11 tourists and their eight companions hostage ten days ago.
The hostages are now in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and eight Egyptian escorts were detained for ten days in the desert and transported unharmed to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
The hostages were freed in the morning by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
They arrived at al-Maza military base, which is directly connected to Cairo International Airport, in good condition, at about half past three in the afternoon.
The hostages were banned from speaking to the press and were immediately transferred to a hospital in Maadi, a suburb of Cairo, where they were examined.
The hostages are “healthy” and the kidnappers “have not been paid a ransom,” Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna said at the airport.
The hostages were captured on 19 September at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border region of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they were on an off-road safari. The group was then dragged from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown hostage takers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and one Romanian woman), as well as eight Egyptians: two tour guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the safari travel agency Aegyptous.
According to an Egyptian security official, a special commando of 30 people arrived on the scene in two helicopters, where they raided the hostage-takers just before dawn.
"There was a firefight between the troops, half of the kidnappers were killed and the rest fled," the leader said.
He also said that a total of 150 special forces from the Egyptian Lightning Brigade were sent to Sudan, where German and Italian commandos were added.
The Italian diplomatic leader Franco Frattini, who is currently in Belgrade, stressed the role of secret agents and special Italian task forces.
“We must recognize that this result could not have been achieved without the professional and effective intervention of our intelligence personnel and task forces,” he said.
He also denied any ransom was paid for the hostages.
The previous day, the Sudanese army announced that it had intercepted an off-road vehicle carrying the kidnappers, killing six of them, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army claimed that the hostage-takers were linked to the Sudanese Liberation Movement (SLA-U), a rebel group in Darfur, which the organization immediately denied.
Lettres - The "Silent Majority" of Culture
At present, the focus of newspaper news and the ongoing election campaign is the debate on the financing of culture.
We can only rejoice in that.
But a slice of our cultural life is still being forgotten.
Who is going to raise their voice to highlight the ridiculous sums of money that small museums, archives, archaeological excavations and national historical sites are on the verge of starvation.
Which politician dares to remind the federal government that he does not care about his monuments and buildings that are part of the cultural heritage?
Or the fact that there are no laws in Quebec or Canada that actually ensure the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government spent three and a half million euros on the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley alone?
And the Constitution of our American neighbors states that the protection of cultural heritage is a part of American culture, and that this heritage must be protected in a coordinated manner by all citizens, all elected representatives, and all government agencies.
In the framework of the Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec (Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec), more than 40,000 volunteers from 211 societies dealing with history, cultural heritage, archiving and genealogy are engaged in the research of history and the preservation of a large number of private archives and archaeological finds with a minimum budget.
Often, these organizations are tooth and nail defending our heritage and protesting with the last shred of drowning as property developers and policymakers direct their bulldozers towards our old buildings and forgotten cemeteries.
When will anyone stand up for the protection of historical and cultural heritage?
The Benelux governments nationalize a part of Fortis bank
The Benelux countries are helping with partial nationalisation on the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortison, which was the first European to be in trouble due to the spillover effect of the US credit market crisis: the three countries are supporting the financial and insurance institution with a total of 11.2 billion euros.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held talks at the highest level on the matter at the end of the week, involving the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s Competition Commissioner.
In the euro area, Fortis Bank is facing its first major crisis in the wake of an international financial market crisis that has been raging for more than a year, and its decisions can therefore be regarded as precedential in some respects.
According to the decision made on Sunday night, all three states will buy nearly half (49 percent) of the bank’s existing assets there.
The bank will certainly sell some of its interests, including, in particular, those acquired from the Dutch company ABN Amro last year, mainly insurance.
Fortis shares started to plummet last week, and in the second half of the week there were serious crises at the institute.
Analysts agree, however, that with 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to allow it to go bankrupt.
On Friday, the company’s stock fell by about 12 percent to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
In terms of current share prices, the group has a total market capitalisation of around EUR 14 billion, but this is not realistic according to the company directors.
The management blamed overseas market uncertainties related to the adoption of the US $700 billion package plan for the fall of Fortis shares.
By Monday, the papers had risen slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the new CEO of the bank.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but so far no one has come forward with a meaningful offer.
The Belgian government has already indicated that investors do not have to worry about losing their money.
So far, there has been no panic among the bank’s clients, and the branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has its own branch and has also acquired leasing companies.
The fox in the henhouse
In the United States, life and health insurers often refuse to take out an insurance contract based on people’s drug purchase data.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
“There is a data protection program that always makes the use of prescription data subject’s consent.
It has to be in independent hands, otherwise we leave the henhouse to the fox,” Richard Dick, the developer of the drug prescription tracking program, told The Washington Post.
Insurance companies make the insurance premium and the amount due in the event of damage dependent on the health of the applicant customer, and if they consider the risk too great, they do not even take out insurance with it.
In the past, the person was sent for a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only with the knowledge of the results of the examination.
Ten years ago, Dick came up with a much cheaper method: he could easily get the drugs he had bought in the past year and a half from pharmacies based on the customer’s ID number, and the program itself would infer the disease he was suffering from and the state of his health.
For example, if you regularly take high doses of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it indicates that you have virtually uncontrollably high blood fat levels, which immediately puts you in a higher risk category.
There are several versions of the program on the market, some of which also determine a risk multiplier, so the insurer has little to do outside of the paperwork, although minor difficulties arise.
The disadvantages include that some drugs can be used for multiple purposes, for example, some compounds can be used against migraines or hot flashes, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter is a significant risk-increasing factor for business insurers, the former not.
Separate companies have been formed for the retrieval and processing of the data, and before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies, they ask the patient’s consent.
They are now obliged to do so by the authorities, although they have not been punished for their failure to do so.
More recently, some companies are processing the results of laboratory tests and linking them to drug consumption data, so they can provide an even more accurate picture of the patients’ health status.
More and more companies have access to the data, and at the same time it will become more and more difficult to control the use of the data.
There is a separate health data protection law, but it only applies to health care providers and insurers.
There is a bill in front of the Congress that gives the authorities control over companies specialising in data provision.
Dick Richard admits that this is not enough: he has therefore further developed his programme, which would make the transfer of data subject’s explicit consent subject to it.
Another issue is that the person concerned can hardly refuse the consent, otherwise the insurers will not enter into a contract with him.
So the hens are somehow dependent on the fox's benevolence.
The Global Marseille Menu
The European Union and India are doubling their trade.
As the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, this issue dominated the agenda of the ninth summit, alongside other, largely global, issues.
There will also be a French-Indian summit today, which will focus on nuclear energy cooperation.
The European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic power that should have a greater say in international affairs, but member states have not yet reached a consensus on whether to support New Delhi’s permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
This question was therefore not raised at the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union, and Commission President José Manuel Barroso and High Representative Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed to double trade to more than 100 billion euros in five years.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious target.
In this spirit, the 26 bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been legally consolidated, meaning that air traffic may also soar in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the talks.
The aim is to balance the fact that while the EU is India's number one trading partner, New Delhi is only the ninth in the EU's list of partners.
The summit focused its attention on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as terrorism, were condemned in all its forms on both sides and called for a UN conference to be convened.
They also called for an end to the Doha trade round, although both have played a large part in the failure so far.
The EU has confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate programme, which aims to reduce emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India has also agreed that a global deal should be reached at next year’s climate conference and greenhouse gas production should be cut by 50% by 2050.
They also want to prevent the rise in food prices and have supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is heading to the French capital today, where he is preparing to make a deal on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will be awarded 20 billion euros for the construction of Indian nuclear reactors.
The news agency said the deal would last for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
There is a strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishing houses will be present at the 60th Buchmesse, the most important international copyright fair.
7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries are expected to attend this year’s Frankfurt International Book Fair, covering an area of 171,790 square metres, where more than 403,000 books will be presented.
At the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion, the Italian Government will be represented by Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy State Secretary for Cultural Goods and Activities, as Italy will occupy 264 square metres of exhibition space by setting up a single Italia Point.
The opening ceremony will be followed by a press conference in the "Room Structur" room of the Buchmesse 5.0 pavilion, where the state of Italian publishing will be presented with data, trends and prospects.
According to the data, the share of foreign authors in the Italian publishing market is constantly decreasing, especially in the field of adult and youth publications.
Billionaire Steve Fossett's plane has been found.
The remains of billionaire Steve Fossett, who disappeared over the Nevada desert on September 3, 2007, have been found.
The wreckage was found on a 3,000-meter-high plateau in the Mammoth Lakes region of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, on the border between California and Nevada.
No human remains were found inside the aircraft.
John Anderson, sheriff of Madera County, said: “After determining the location of the plane, we have sent out a team and can now be sure that it is the plane that Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared.”
The sheriff also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Transportation Security Administration (NTSB) said a few hours after the wreck was discovered, a search committee was called in to identify the plane and determine that it was indeed the Bellanca 8kcab that went missing on September 3, 2007, the day Fossett left Yerington, Nevada, for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, also in California, not far from the Nevada border, a couple found some of Fossett’s personal belongings near his home in Mammoth Lakes.
Two I.D.s in Fosset's name, issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, some cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was abandoned a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire has set a number of summits through which he has written himself into history.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he was able to fly around the earth for the first time with a balloon: two weeks of solitary flight.
Three years later, he circled the earth by plane without landing.
Among his many records is a flight over the Andes at an altitude of 15.445 meters, which he performed with a co-pilot.
GLK, shocking advertising
An unusual, yet original and distinctly formal recreational vehicle with large surfaces and clean corners.
In a few words, this is the latest "compact off-road vehicle" from Mercedes-Benz, with which the German car manufacturer tried to bring fresh impetus to the market.
It is precisely because of this unconventional content that the introductory campaign for the SUV GLK available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17 will be surprising and unusual.
The advertising campaign accompanying the introduction of the new vehicle uses a hitherto unknown media-communication tool, including utopian 3D posters that have not been used by a car brand in Italy.
The billboard action, which consists of three stages, will dominate Milan’s central shopping street, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of media communication begins with a three-dimensional presentation of the car, in which the new SUV, with the help of special glasses distributed around Corso Como, will be seen in almost real sizes and in three-dimensional form.
When you look at the picture, it will feel as if the car is coming out of the poster.
Then, thanks to the innovative Elumina8 technology, every detail of the new GLK becomes visible one by one and then becomes a unified image.
Undoubtedly, with this promotion Mercedes is trying to introduce something new to the stereotypical advertising world of the automotive industry.
Will it be able to attract the attention of future customers? We’ll see.
Let’s see who the Italian football hooligans are.
Triveneto youths, they'll probably be disqualified.
But who are these 150-200 boys and girls, for whom all of Italy is now ashamed? They are members of a group called "Ultras Italia", which has been following the national team for years and which, in truth, has not caused too much trouble so far.
They never clashed with the enemy's fans.
The core of the group is on the right.
The main organizers are from Trivento.
Also from Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
These were joined in Sofia by smaller sporadic groups from Campania and Puglia (actually only a few units).
They waved Italian flags with the home town of the fans on them: on Saturday they were taken off so that they could not be identified.
They follow the example of the English fans.
In Bulgaria, they faced a real Nazi fan club, the Levski fans.
The Italian Football Association made 144 tickets available to Italian fans. These were registered tickets, making it easier to check the support team.
The Interior Ministry also checked everyone: there was no one on trial in Sofia, no one who was banned from visiting the stadium.
Four Italian fans with football-related criminal records were denied tickets and exits.
At the moment, the Interior Ministry is waiting for reports from the Sofia police, after which it will take the necessary measures: supporters who were arrested or identified during the riots may be subject to a five-year ban.
It is an international ban that applies not only to visits to the Italian stadium, but to all the stadiums in Europe.
Our football hooligans are therefore not allowed to set foot on any football field.
Fortunately.
But we must also fear that the hooligans will find followers, that is, that this little one hundred and fifty people will be joined by others.
“This fire must be put out immediately, and those who behave in this way must not be excused,” the Interior Ministry said.
So it is better to keep our eyes open, especially as we are approaching the day of the national team game on Wednesday, in Lecce.
There is a small cell in Puglia that supports the Italian ultras.
Tomorrow, the Monitoring Service will meet, and on Tuesday, the Committee for the Analysis of the Safety of Sports Events, which can also count on one of the departments of the internal security service, the secret services dealing with fan behavior.
"Duce-Duce chanting and swinging arm during the Italian anthem? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime..."
This idea was expressed, rather unhappily, by Domenico Mazzilli, who was appointed a few weeks ago as head of the observation service of the Ministry of the Interior (the post was taken by Francesco Tagliente and before that by Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli previously served as police chief of Trieste, the city where a cell supporting the Ultras Italy group has been operating since 2002.
What Mazzilli says is true, it is not forbidden to live the Duce in Bulgaria, but the behaviour of the 150-200 fans was shameful.
I am not a sociologist, added the first man of the observation service, but crimes must be judged in the country where they are committed.
Until now, this group has not been a problem. We need to look at exactly what happened and consider how to proceed.
But let us also talk a little about the whistle of the Italian national anthem: it is not a crime, but, if I may say so, it is not a good education either.”
