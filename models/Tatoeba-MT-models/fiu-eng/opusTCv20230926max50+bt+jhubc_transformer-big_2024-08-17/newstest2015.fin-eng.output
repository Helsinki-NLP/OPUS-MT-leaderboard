The City of Juankoski will join the City of Kuopio at the beginning of 2017.
The city council unanimously approved the merger on Monday.
Juankoski City Council approved the merger last week.
The municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved in the settlement, but its council decided that Tuusniemi would continue as an independent municipality.
Kuopio and Juankoski will decide on the next municipal elections separately.
The next municipal elections will be held in 2016.
After the accession of Juankoski, Kuopio has a population of about 111,000.
Prime Ministers of India and Japan to meet in Tokyo
India’s new Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet with his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Tokyo to discuss economic and security relations, during his first major foreign visit since winning the election in May.
Modi’s five-day visit to Japan aims to strengthen economic relations with the world’s third-largest economy.
Plans for extended nuclear cooperation will be at the top of the agenda.
India is also said to be interested in a defence cooperation agreement with Japan.
Putin: Ukrainian troops are shooting at civilians
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday accused the Kiev leadership of refusing to engage in direct political talks with separatists in eastern Ukraine.
The current Kiev leadership does not want to conduct an essential political dialogue with the eastern part of the country, Putin said, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
He also said that pro-Russian separatists, which Kiev and the West say are aided by the Russian army, tried to push the Ukrainian troops away from their current places, where Putin said Ukrainian army troops would shoot civilians.
The goal of the militia fighters is to push away these armed forces and their artillery, so that they do not get the opportunity to shoot the residents of the region, Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at Ryrmikorjaamo.
It was a surprise that the group arrived early in the evening.
There were visitors during the two days as expected, says promoter Tom Kangas.
The Seinäjoki Hiphop Festival was held for the third time.
Next year again.
We’re still going to be a hip-hop festival, so there won’t be any pop, Kangas assures.
On Tuesday, Finland will adopt a law that restricts the procurement of substances suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, private persons must apply for a permit from the Police Board in order to purchase or hold substances or mixtures that could be used as so-called explosives precursors.
Such substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate and mixtures containing them if the specified concentration values are exceeded.
For example, hydrogen peroxide is present in detergents and cleaning agents, but the concentrations do not usually exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane is used in acceleration, for example.
Precursors acquired before the Act entered into force may, however, be held and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster accused of hotel rape in Nairn and Pitlochry
The charges of rape in two hotels are pending trial.
George Webster, 28, heard the charges in a hearing before the Glasgow High Court.
She is accused of rape at Pitlochry Scotland's Hotel in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
Webster is accused of assaulting a woman "while she is unconscious, asleep, and unable to make her own decision."
Webster is also charged with a second rape at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Highlands, on May 4, 2014.
In accordance with the decision of Judge Lady Rae, the trial will take place on 17 November in Edinburgh in the High Court.
Premier League: Super Raheem shined - Mario was left in the shadow - Premier League - Ilta-Sanomat
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling once again demonstrated why he is considered the future of English football.
White Hart Lane had an electric atmosphere on Sunday when Mario Balotelli's strengthened Liverpool arrived to visit Tottenham.
The first appearance of Super Mario was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian working in the field with a completely different attitude than during the Manchester City era.
Balotelli was still far from his peak.
The Italian lost three high-quality goals and only fed half of his 16 assists to his own team.
The Pool supporters, who have already chosen the player as their favourite, expect better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers assigned Balotelli to the role of Luis Suarez, who had travelled to Barcelona, as the team's second striker alongside Daniel Sturridge.
The star of the team was Raheem Sterling, who overtook Hugo Lloris in the important opening goal of the 3-0 win.
Sterling, 19, doesn't just shine.
An Englishman shorter than a Balotellia by 20 centimetres is between the lines of an opponent, like a fish in water.
This feature is not common for a player who is racing on the grass at a speed of around 34 km/h.
Rodgers also deserves a lot of credit for Sterling's development.
After the match, the Northern Irelander said that Liverpool had systematically developed a North West Londoner from the foothills of Wembley into a more complete player than just a winger.
Susanna Mälkki was elected Chief Conductor of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra - "I am happy and proud"
The Helsinki City Board has decided to appoint Susanna Mälki as the next Chief Conductor of the Helsinki City Orchestra from autumn 2016.
The Los Angeles Times asked him which band he was going to play next.
Susanna Mälkki says that she will start in her new position with joy and pride.
The Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra has played a central role in the musical life of Finland for over a hundred years, including the premiere of a large number of Sibelius's music.
The orchestra has been conducted by the best Finnish conductors and I have worked with many members of the orchestra before.
I look forward to our future cooperation,” he says.
Administrations of employee organisations to meet in pension negotiations - Kotimaa - Regions - News - Karjalainen
A new impetus is being sought for the pension negotiations at the labour market organisations’ own meetings.
The governments of SAK, Akava and STTK will discuss the negotiation situation in the morning.
After that, the actual pension negotiations are to be continued.
Labour market organisations have been vexed, among other things, by the dispute over linking retirement age to life expectancy.
The organisations have promised a career solution by the autumn, but according to the latest estimate, it would be created during this week.
Confessor.
Women’s volleyball league team Woman Volley from Rovaniemi tripped over the Vampula Athletes in the Pihtipudas training tournament final on Sunday.
Vampula won 5 games 3-2.
WoVo lost the last round 15-11.
The neighbors were always one step ahead.
The fight was good, but Vampula was a bit better in the defense game and in the passport game, saw WoVo coach Teemu Mäkikyr<0xC3><0xB6>.
WoVo’s six was ragged in that the 190-centimeter American centimeter Jennifer Keddy was stuck with her back to the side.
The quarterback was Sara Niemi.
Karoliina Kyll<0xC3><0xB6>nen was able to play with her thumb and formed the most firepower combination of WoVo with Johanna Pekkarinen.
Jenna Keskimäki, who started as a chipper, got to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 rounds.
The best part of Vampula was the skilful Russian passer-by and the libero Hillaelina Hämäläinen, which WoVo toured as much as possible.
WoVo’s preparations for the league will continue next weekend when HPK Hämeenlinna comes to a training camp in Rovaniemi.
The team will meet on Saturday at the "shop" at 6 p.m. in an official practice game.
On Sunday we will meet again in sports.
Lidl forges wild numbers in Finland
The net sales of the company’s stores in Finland increased by almost 25 per cent to nearly EUR 1.2 billion during the financial year ended at the end of February.
The company released its results on Monday.
Lidl now has a total of 142 stores in Finland, and the expansion is planned to continue.
Lidl also said that he paid nearly EUR 14 million in taxes to Finland for the last financial year.
Lidl Finland is part of the German Lidl Group.
The company has more than 4,200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer deaths more often in sparsely populated areas due to delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released a video in tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
In Australia, women living in rural areas have a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in urban areas.
Researchers looked at the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, and found that only 35 percent of women lived more than five years after diagnosis.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
Small Study: New Drugs May Slow Down Lung and Ovarian Cancer
The researchers looked at the health history of women over a seven-year period.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, the woman’s age at the time of diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, previous medical conditions, and socioeconomic status also affected her chances of survival.
In older women and with more widespread cancer at the time of diagnosis, the probability of survival was the lowest.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not aim to find out why women living outside cities are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan sees delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment as possible causes.
"Specialists in gynecological oncology treat this disease best, and their clinics are mostly located in large cities," Jordan says.
Although distance-based treatments are becoming more common and less important, the researcher also suggests increasing the mobility of doctors so that specialists can treat patients closer to home, as well as programmes to support patients who are treated far from home.
According to Dr. Jordan’s research, the long-term survival rate of women with ovarian cancer is poor regardless of their geographic location, underscoring the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programs.
The study, funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer charity, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother living in the Gold Coast, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The City of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen snowmobile parking in the Friendship Park, which is located next to the hotel Pohjanhovi.
The City Board decided on Monday that the proposal for the town plan for Friendship Park and its surroundings will be placed on public display at the service point Osviitta.
The Environmental Board and the Lapland ELY Centre are asked for opinions on the plan proposal.
With the change in the city plan, the city wants to enable the continuation of tourism-related snowmobiling activities in the region.
The plan is to create a park area that will include the current Friendship Park and the area between it and the river.
According to the proposal, a maximum of 200 snowmobiles will be permanently available between 15 November and 30 April.
You can also place refuelling points in certain parts of the area.
Maintenance traffic is also allowed in the new park area.
The City of Rovaniemi has leased the Friendship Park area to safari companies for snowmobiling during the winter.
The lease agreement was last renewed in spring 2014 and is valid until spring 2018.
The snowmobile parking and the change in the plan have provoked even loud opposition.
Residents of neighboring blocks of flats have been annoyed by both the noise and the emissions.
However, the emissions in the area have been studied and no observations have been made that exceed the guide values.
The renewed equipment is also more low-emission than the old one.
Friendship Park as a parking area is also supported by the fact that if the departure point was moved further away, the hotel’s safari customers would have to be transported to the safari departure points by buses, which would have an estimated 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the Friendship Park area and the surrounding area are also large enough for sleds, better than the places proposed as replacement places of departure, such as the eastern side of the boat dock next to the bridges of the River Ounasjoki.
The friendship park is also good in its location, because in the future the activities can be expanded to the Ounaspaviljonki area, for example.
The establishment of parking operations is part of the city strategy approved by the Rovaniemi City Council, according to which the city aims, among other things, to create a good framework for business operations by reserving sufficient high-quality areas in logistically and functionally affordable locations.
The Friendship Park has also been marked as the starting point for snowmobiling in the city centre’s partial master plan, which has not yet received legal force.
The decrease in owner-occupied dwellings can be seen in garden stores
The decline in the number of homeowners, especially in the group of people under 35, may lead to a fall in the turnover of horticultural stores by tens of millions, as today's young consumers reach the "main target group" of horticultural sales in terms of age.
According to the Financial Times, homeowners spend only 55 percent of the money they spend on gardening.
The study had also revealed that more and more people live in highly urbanized apartments without gardens. In addition, the size of the garden decreases as the front yard is increasingly paved as a parking space. Also, these factors threaten the garden area, which has an estimated value of about 5 billion pounds per year.
In the Greater London area, home ownership has fallen from 61 percent to 43 percent in six years, with the lowest per-household spending on horticultural products in the country.
However, according to the HTA and the British Garden Association (RHS), an increase in the rental of housing or a decrease in the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, senior garden advisor at RHS, says that “for example, plants grown in mobile growing containers are particularly popular with homeowners because such growing containers can be taken with them when needed.”
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were a period of boom in horticultural retailing, as housing ownership and wealth increased from the end of the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that trade will pick up this year due to better weather conditions, compared to the worse weather in March and April of last year.
Turkey questions U.S. diplomat over spy report
Turkey’s foreign ministry has called on the country’s most experienced U.S. diplomat to give an account of the report on spying by the U.S. and British in Turkey.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Bulent, the US Embassy’s chargé d’affaires and the Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
German newspaper Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept have reported that documents leaked by Edward Snowden, a former analyst with the National Security Agency (NSA), reveal that Turkey was the main target of spying by the US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the significance of the report, saying that all major countries had spied on each other.
A previous report on German spying in Ankara sparked an angrier reaction from the Turkish government.
Cannes winner Croze to appear in new Finnish film
Canadian actress Marie-Josée Croze, who has appeared in several successful films, has been cast as a leading lady in the new Finnish film.
Croze will star in director Mikko Kuparinen’s film 2 Nights Until Morning, which starts shooting this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the Cannes Film Festival Best Actress Award for her role in the 2003 film Barbarian Invasion.
He has appeared in Steven Spielberg's Munich and Julian Schnabel's The Butterfly in the Glass Dome.
Two Nights in the Morning starring Mikko Nousiainen.
The film will be released in Finland in September 2015.
Majorca Magaluf police chief charged with corruption
The whistleblowers provided evidence of blackmail by police and Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> City Council officials at the Mallorca Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The police chief of Calvi<0xC3><0xA0>, on Mallorca’s holiday island, has been arrested following allegations of corruption by shop and bar owners in the Magaluf region, a region known for its wet partying.
Capt. José Antonio Navarro was placed in pre-trial detention after several business owners on Punta Ballena Street filed corruption charges against him. Punta Ballena Street houses most of Magaluf’s bars and nightclubs.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, those who reported the incident provided evidence of blackmail by police and Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> City Council officials at the Mallorca Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish National Guard on corruption charges and are being questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
The nationwide daily ABC reported that nightclub owners were angry about the authorities’ bias, which significantly hampered their business.
"It's not about money anymore, it's about survival," one business owner told the court.
You will not destroy our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in the headlines in several countries this summer when an online YouTube video was released in which an 18-year-old British holidaymaker had oral sex with 24 men during a so-called pub crawl.
Since then, the island’s authorities have tried to curb the intoxicated and uncontrolled behaviour of Magaluf holidaymakers by reducing the attendance of the infamous, alcoholic pub crawls.
In addition, the Playhouse nightclub where the oral sex video was filmed was ordered to be closed for a year, and the owner of the nightclub and the organiser of the pub crawl, Carnage, were jointly ordered to pay a fine of EUR 55 000.
The so-called balconing trend, which has caused a number of accidents caused by alcohol consumption when people have jumped from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool, has also become popular in the tourist destination of Magaluf, which is especially popular among young British tourists.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters as their communities were bombed by rockets and mortars during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and schools remained closed as the region recovered from the fighting.
The opening of schools brought joy and excitement to rocket-bombed communities in southern Israel, but the signs of fighting are still visible.
In the southern town of Ashdod, in the Pashosh kindergarten, workers removed shrapnel from the walls and slides before the children arrived after a rocket hit the kindergarten.
“We’re a little scared but also excited,” says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbutz called Saad, an Israeli commune, and works as an English teacher at a city school.
Many children living in this area are in dire need of routines.
Bart’s 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart says going back to school after a long time feels “a bit strange”.
“We’ve had some tough times where we didn’t leave home,” he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Before the ceasefire began last week, thousands of people in border communities like Saad had stayed indoors or left their homes in safer areas away from Gaza to escape fire from rockets and grenades.
Many residents of the Nahal Oz community near the Gaza front are hesitant to return after a Palestinian grenade killed a four-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, more than 10 families had not yet returned.
The children of these families have so far been placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city near the Gaza border that was the target of heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that “children’s education and safety will be taken care of”.
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite ceasefire on Tuesday.
The cease-fire immediately interrupted the fighting, but it did not resolve many key issues, including Hamas' demand for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade and the reopening of Gaza's air and sea routes.
Israel wants to disarm Hamas and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
In Egypt, a new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three-quarters of them civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the death toll, stating that at least half of the dead were soldiers, although it has had no hard evidence of this.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gazan soldiers fired 4,591 rockets and grenades at Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
The Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.
Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people took refuge in more than 100 UN-run schools that had been converted into temporary shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still sheltered and fighting continuing, school officials postponed the start of school the previous week.
“I hope the school will open soon and we will be able to go back to school, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old who lives in a shelter at a school in Gaza City.
According to a commonly used indicator, house prices have risen the most in seven years in Australia’s winter months.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing price index, which measures housing prices in the Australian capital, rose by 1.1% in August, RP data showed on Monday.
As a result of the increase, prices rose by 4.2 per cent in June, July and August, i.e. more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual rise in prices was 10.9 per cent, which is more than twice as much as in the 12 months prior to August 2013, but prices have not risen steadily across the country.
According to Tim Lawless, Research Director at RP Data, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the price hike.
RP Data results show that house prices rose by 16.1% in Sydney and 11.7% in Melbourne last year.
The housing markets of Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin are the next busiest; the average price increase is between 5% and 6%.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4% a year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawless, the start of spring in Australia will increase the number of apartments for sale in the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
“Given the rise in the sale of homes for auction, the generally buoyant pace of sales, and the continuing low interest rates, it is likely that house prices will continue to rise over the next three months,” Lawless says.
The new G<0xC3><0xB6>sta Museum has attracted record-breaking audiences to Mänttä
The new museum and visual arts have attracted record-breaking audiences to Mänttä this summer.
More than 70,000 visitors have visited the Serlachius Art Museum by the end of August.
The new G<0xC3><0xB6>sta Museum was opened in June and has exhibited, among others, classic works of pop art by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
Mänttä Art Festival announced on Monday that it had set a visitor record, as 14,500 people had visited the Hetkinen event this summer.
We are not used to these figures.
People have been turning away from doors and windows," says Director Pauli Sivonen from the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the number of visitors to the Serlachius Museums this year will be close to 100,000.
In previous years, there have been about 40,000 visitors.
Mänttä-Vilppula, located halfway between Tampere and Jyväskylä, has about 11,000 inhabitants.
Museum Director Sivonen points out that new museums are always phenomena when they open.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
In Mänttä, it is hoped that the art season will continue well over the summer.
In autumn, new exhibitions will be opened at the Art Museum.
Police are investigating four thefts in the past few days in Kajaani.
On Sunday evening, a window was broken into a commercial property on Pohjolankatu.
He had received a small amount of cash from the cash register.
Between Thursday and Monday, fuel had been stolen from a truck tank on Syväojankatu.
The boat with outboard motor had been taken from Petäisenniska marina between Sunday and Monday.
The rowing boat was light on the outside and yellow on the inside.
On the inside was the inscription "OIVA" on the nose.
A couple of suspected thieves have already been arrested.
On Sunday evening, the store was broken into.
A police dog was found hiding under a tree in the forest, and a man in his twenties was found hiding.
On Monday, police caught another man in Paltamo, who is also suspected of committing the same burglary.
Missing amphetamine brings murder charge in Kajaani
The disappearance of less than ten grams of amphetamine brought a murder charge against a Kajaanin man born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man went into the apartment with his partner and another man and shot the owner of the apartment, a 34-year-old Kajaani woman, with a shotgun.
The defendant denied the charges and claimed that the other man was the shooter.
The incident came to the police’s attention when a police patrol stopped a passenger car with a party burning clothes used in blood work.
In addition to burnt clothes, a shotgun was found in the car.
The Kainuu District Court will issue a ruling on the matter later.
August was unusually warm in many places.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, an equally warm August repeats on average once every ten years.
The statistics of the Finnish Meteorological Institute show that the average temperature was higher than usual in the whole country.
In most parts of the country, the deviation was one to two degrees.
Due to the high temperatures in July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature during the whole summer was measured in Pori in the first week of August, where the temperature was 32.8 degrees Celsius.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
He never said he loved me
Henry was born into a Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley, in the British Midlands, in 1958.
Henry's father worked in a factory and died when Henry was 19 years old.
Henry is currently rehearsing for a comedy show called Rudy's Rare Records, which is based in part on a fictional conversation he had with his father, and is based on the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap upbeat.
Henry has had to go through painful childhood memories.
She has been in therapy several times since her mother’s death, and she thinks a lot about her relationship with her father.
My father was very difficult to read.
His face was never seen, only a voice said: Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move! Move!
I'm watching cricket now.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, visited the pub with my father and discussed such things as the shape of a pint of beer or the beauty of playing cricket.
I never talked to him about such things.
For most of my life, he was to me the smileless man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal smelter in Dudley, giving him an idea of what his father’s life must have been like, even though the working conditions are better now than they were then.
The melting pots are now a little brighter, but they are basically dark, smoky, labyrinth-like depths, bursting with flames, smoke, and soot, reminiscent of the underworld.
Dad used to take a bath and just lie in the tub, and slowly he started to sing to himself as he washed away the dirt from the smelter.
As I walked around the smelter, I realized that he had been working for years to get us food on the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Despite this, Henry’s childhood lacked the closeness offered by his parents.
My father never hugged me and never said he loved me.
It wasn’t until my mother started getting sick shortly before she died that we started telling each other that we loved each other.
Henry has a daughter, Billie, with Dawn French, and through her own child, she has been able to share the love she lacked as a child.
Do you have to keep saying "I love you"?
Will you stop hugging me?
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry is still a good friend of French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn's a good person.
Why can't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to her mother’s death.
When I began to suffer from excess weight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to make a U-turn.
After that, I started to exercise a lot, and I also had to start a heavy diet to reduce my symptoms.
It is very difficult –
and boring.
No one enjoys eating carrots.
Henry’s well-known, short beard perhaps illustrates his transformation during his career.
After receiving a lot of positive feedback from the critics about his role as Othello, he is immersed in the making of theatre.
It was followed by August Wilson's Fences.
Making theatre offers a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that Henry has made throughout his busy career.
Henry started in the industry when he was only 16 years old.
A DJ spotted him on stage doing imitations and contacted the New Faces talent show.
Henry's television career began in the mid-1970s. "For quite a long time, I was the only black impersonator and comedian on TV," he says.
Henry learned while working.
I had to grow up in the spotlight of publicity, I had to learn how to make jokes on the conveyor belt between 1975 and 1985, while living stardom and being on TV.
Lenny at the New Faces in 1975
Henry's manager had stage privileges for The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment show in which the characters performed with black makeup, so Henry ended up on the show as a comedian for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never participated in it, but I do not regret it.
Even though my position was strange and reprehensible, I was able to work at huge events and learn how to handle the audience.
Yet "British TV's award-winning, multi-year favourite and light entertainment show" was also "a grotesque parody of black people".
In the 1980s, Henry worked on another comedy series that both made fun of and admired black British culture.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the 1990s Henry was known for his role as Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
Henry spent the next decade dealing with commercials, documentaries, TV shows, and movie parts, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv, he said to himself, “What you’re going to do next, Len – now it looks like you’re just pedaling in place or sidetracking.”
Next up was the documentary series "What's So Great About...?" on Radio 4.
The first part deals with Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It wasn’t really taught to us properly in school, and I think it belonged to the white middle class, who wear tights and have money.
That's why the Shakespeare theme scared me.
All the people we interviewed on the show – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me, “Try it.
Don't abandon the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
You're going to date words, and you're going to understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry uttered 20 verses of Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was sold.
I felt like I could do this.
It was almost as if a part of me had been missing before, and now it was put in place.
“That’s what it’s all about, it’s important, so take it seriously, learn your verse, do a little background research.
So the rehearsal process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was realized.
The show was ultimately a success.
It was apparently expected to fail, but that was not quite the case.
Shortly thereafter, Henry played the lead role in The Comedy of Errors.
Suddenly I was in the British National Theatre and I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, “Oh, you’ve changed.”
Once there were technical problems in the play, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
“A little voice in my head said to me, ‘You’ve got to manage for 10 minutes on your own until the computer works again.’”
Instead, the instructor’s assistant announced that the performance would be resumed as soon as the problem had been corrected.
I walked out of the scene, and part of me sighed with relief.
It is not my duty,
I can leave it to others to take care of.
“You’re part of the show, stay in your role.”
Henry Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the turn words to the play "Fences" was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes a person more resilient.
This play, too, was well received, so it was like a sign from the gods, “This is what you must do.”
This is what Henry says, of course, in TWO voices.
So I decided to stay here.
I sincerely love this job.
I love practice rooms.
However, Henry is still basically a comedian: the little jokes constantly interrupt our conversations as he switches from one imitation to another.
Abstaining from stand-up comedy is a matter of will, as it is dangerous to receive instant praise from an unknown audience.
If you are constantly thirsty for it, it can lead to a dead end.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theater when I feel like it, but generally speaking, it no longer excites me the way it used to.
I'll ask Henry if he's going on another stand-up tour.
It gives me real pleasure to sit with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle and end of the whole journey, and I don’t think I ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new rebirth?
Yeah, I think so.
I like to play...
it's really fun.
I am constantly telling a story, and I enjoy doing it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya prepares register of civil servants to remove ‘ghost workers’
Kenya has begun to compile a biometric register of civil servants in an attempt to remove “ghost workers” from government payrolls.
Employees who did not register for the next two weeks would no longer receive a salary, the government said in a statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people are still being paid after they leave their positions as civil servants.
Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta vowed to end corruption in the public sector when he took office in 2013.
According to a review earlier this year, at least $1 million was spent per month on salaries and other financial abuses of “ghost workers.”
The government suspects that salaries will be paid into the account even after the person has died or has left office, BBC’s Wanyama Chebusiri reported in the capital Nairobi.
All officials will have to register in the coming weeks at the identification centres to ensure that their data is stored in a biometric registration format, the government said in a statement.
According to the statement, anyone who fails to do so without due cause will be removed from the payroll.
"This measure will significantly rationalise the public sector, because it will determine how many people actually work in their jobs. It will also clean up the payroll at both levels of government. It will solve the problem of 'ghost workers'," says Anne Waiguru, an official in the Cabinet of the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning.
Seinäjoki’s result for the financial year 2015 may remain in deficit by EUR 25.5 million unless the city adjusts its operations and expenditure development in a tight economic situation.
Based on the current budget preparation, the annual contribution margin is expected to remain at a deficit of approximately 9.4 million.
Possible ways to improve efficiency were to compromise on the scope and level of services, as well as to purchase services, sell assets and grants, and increase tax and fee income.
Of the EUR 10 million in investment, the size of the target is EUR 8.5 million.
There is no relief for the local authorities.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient growth in tax revenue, increasing unemployment and a five per cent cut in central government transfers further weaken the outlook.
The purpose of the economic seminar is to find new ways to balance the economy.
The City Council is in agreement that savings should be made.
The ship must be turned into a target in line with the strategy,” says Kimmo Heinonen, Chairman of the City Board.
The City Board returned the submitted proposals to the management team for further preparation.
The City Board’s proposals will form the basis for the budget preparation at the council’s economic seminar in Frame on Monday 8 September.
After the council seminar, the budget proposal progresses through the board proceedings to the City Board and City Council.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested on suspicion of plotting against Turkish government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of “anti-government plots”, local media sources say.
Police did not immediately comment.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, 14 high-ranking police officers were among those arrested.
Some police officers were in contact with corruption investigations last December that targeted government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, a number of police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of organising a large-scale crime scene and monitoring telephones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was Prime Minister at the time) said the police actions were part of a plan by Islamist leader Fethullah Gullen against him and others in power.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine opened their doors on Monday (Sept. 1) after the summer holidays.
This is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told expectant reporters that not all schools have reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The first of September ceremonies were not held in every school.
There is no peace in Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the entire huge Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukhov, who is a leading teacher at the Slaviansky school, where Yatsenyuk’s daughter attends, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return here and that children will be able to learn lessons that will benefit them in the future.
Celebrations of the first day of school traditionally include children's embroidered shirts, balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
Perry of Texas says the tweet was illegal.
A defamatory image of a Democratic district attorney was posted from Texas Governor Rick Perry’s verified Twitter account on Sunday evening, midway through his hearing of allegations of abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by a new tweet in which Perry swore he had nothing to do with the photo.
The tweet was sent illegally from my account.
“I don’t approve of the tweet and I’ve deleted it,” a later release said.
Perry's backup did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.
While the tweets were sent from Perry’s verified Twitter account, it’s unclear who posted the photo.
The first tweet contained a defamatory caricature of Travis’ district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry blocked Lehmberg's funding when he refused to resign, leading to a grand jury meeting in Austin this month with Perry on trial. Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
The tweet read: “I don’t always drive drunk, at three times the maximum number allowed... But when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing the finger.”
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office didn't lead a grand jury investigation into Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a San Antionio special prosecutor appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry said he was innocent and called the allegations a political plot.
His powerful legal team has asked the judge in charge to dismiss the charges, saying that the law on which the longest-serving Texas governor is charged is unclear, as reflected in the Constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million in state subsidies to the state’s public immunity unit, which operates in Travis County and handles public-sector accusations when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Mr Perry's decision led the left-leaning monitoring group to lodge a formal complaint.
Perry’s verified Twitter account is regularly updated – and sometimes famously.
After winning fifth place in the Iowa election during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to end the tie by posting on Twitter a picture of himself jogging on a lake with the caption "Here I come, South Carolina!"
According to Berkeley, the housing market is “normal” again.
One of London’s most important developers has warned that the housing market in the south-east of England has “returned” to normal activity levels.
Housing in the capital city of London has been plagued by huge demand and steep price increases, while fears of widespread credit bubbles have prompted the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgages in June.
The founder and chairman of Berkeley, Tony Pidgley, said on Monday that “since the start of this fiscal year, markets and trade volumes have returned to normal after the peak of 2013” and added that this has enabled a “stable environment”.
London’s housing market went well during the recession, with foreign investors flocking to the capital.
According to the Cadastral Register, housing prices in the city rose by 18.5 per cent in the previous year alone, well above the England and Wales average of 6.7 per cent.
The average selling price of Berkeley’s private, affordable and student buildings rose by about a fifth in the previous year, reaching a price increase of <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 by the end of April.
However, the strengthened pound has made London’s properties less attractive in recent months – some of the interest has also been driven by new property tax laws and political rhetoric about a possible “map tax” ahead of the May general election.
London-based real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that an April mortgage report detailing tighter lending regulations would lead to lower market growth in both property sales and prices in the second half of the year.
Recent data from the Bank of England showed on Monday that the number of approved loans fell in July, suggesting a cooling housing market.
Real estate agent Hamptons International has lowered its 2015 forecast of London property prices by 3% as the homeowners’ price index has already started to weaken.
The number of deals made in the most expensive areas of London – Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington – has fallen by a quarter year-on-year, according to real estate agent WA Ellis.
The demand for homes in the capital, however, is a blessing for Berkeley, which increased its revenue from properties sold to over <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that "the demand for a well-designed, right kind of product in the best locations has remained stable, and thus sales have remained buoyant".
In June, the company announced that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year before April, almost a third more than during the pre-crisis peak in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profits increased by 40% year-on-year to <0xC2><0xA3>380 million and net sales increased by 18% to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
Pidgley said Monday, ahead of the company’s annual meeting, that Berkeley’s earnings for the year match current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the profit before taxes for the whole year is <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
The Berkeley stock sold on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon for <0xC2><0xA3>23.96.
Hacker leaks nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence online
Jennifer Lawrence at the 85th Annual Academy Awards.
A hacker claiming to have pictures of 100 other stars leaked nude photos of Academy Award-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence.
The Hunger Games star’s representative confirmed the images were authentic and condemned the hacker for “arrogant invasion of privacy.”
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes the stolen pictures of Jennifer Lawrence will be charged.
The images, which were originally published on the 4chan image release page, had apparently ended up in the wrong hands due to the weakness of Apple’s iCloud storage system. Dozens of other female stars, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, are claimed to be on the list of hundreds of other hacked stars, BuzzFeed reported.
It is not known how many of the images are authentic, though Scott Pilgrim v. World star Winstead condemned the hack on Twitter.
“To those of you who are watching photos taken years ago by me and my husband in the privacy of our home, I hope you are in a good mood,” Winstead tweeted.
However, Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and "Victorious" series denied the authenticity of the images and tweeted that "these so-called nude photos of me are FALSE, don't you understand".
Let me finish this from the start.
BuzzFeedin announced late Sunday that a representative of pop star Ariana Grande had denied the authenticity of the images of the star.
Only we have an excerpt from Howard Jacobson's acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J".
They dissolved, it best described what had happened, gradually they broke apart like a cardboard box left out in the rain.
Only occasionally did he hear from a woman that she was too serious, laborious, intense, detached, and perhaps a little prickly.
Then he waved his hand.
He recognized the spike.
Yes, he was spiky, like a hedgehog.
The last victim of his thorns had been a relationship in the early stages, which, however, had been promising; it had seemed that this relationship could have eased his lonely boredom, and it might have even brought some substance to his life.
Ailinn Solomons had untamed hair and was a delicately delicate beauty with a cheerful heart, from a village in the north that was even more barren and remote than Port Reuben.
He had come south with an older traveling companion, whom Kevern supposed to be his aunt, who had inherited a house in a humid but Paradise valley, and the name of the valley was fittingly Paradise.
No one had lived in the house for years.
Pipes were leaking, spiders were in all the bathrooms, snails had left their mark on the windows, keeping the whole place their own, weeds were growing in the garden, resembling giant cabbage heads.
The cottage was like a fairy tale for children, at the same time threatening and magical, a garden full of secrets.
Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" has been nominated for the 2014 Booker Prize for Literature.
Nominations will be announced next week
Kevern had been sitting hand in hand with Ailin on broken terrace chairs in the middle of a long hay, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening distractedly to the receiver through which the whole country heard soothing music and soothing news, when Ailin’s crossed, sun-tanned feet had brought to his mind a song that had been sung long ago and forgotten black
Your leg is too big.
Such songs were initially too aggressive and were no longer played on the receiver.
They weren’t banned—nothing was actually banned—they just weren’t played anymore.
They wanted to be forgotten, like the word itself.
Public opinion produced what laws and excommunication had not achieved: just as in literature people chose to read the memoirs of heroes, cookbooks and romances, in music they preferred ballads.
With the day going wild, Kevern began to play the fictitious piano and serenade Ailin’s big feet with an impudently comic voice.
Ailinn did not understand.
"It was the famous song of the jazz pianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, while naturally lifting two fingers in front of his mouth.
This was what his father had always done before the letter "j" escaped from his lips.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father said he played the same game as his father.
If you let a word that starts with "j" out of your mouth and you couldn't remember to put two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn’t a fun game then, and it isn’t now.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn had never heard of such a thing.
Jazz wasn’t banned, it just wasn’t played.
Improvisation was no longer fashionable.
There was only room for one word in life.
When the song started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
Cleverness was the same way.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the cleverness presented through music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Jr. by the age of 10, jazz music had become familiar to him through his father's semi-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailin that Fats Waller was black.
Given Ailinn’s age, it was likely that she did not remember a time when popular singers were not black.
There was no need for laws or coercion.
Obedient society meant that each of its parts gratefully, gratefully, accepted as if they had been spared by fortune, the principle that each group did things natural to it.
Based on their temperament and physical characteristics, people of Afro-Caribbean descent are best suited for entertainment and sports, so they sang and ran.
Originally from the Indian continent, they were naturally gifted with electrical appliances, so their job was to make sure that each family had a working telephone that was used to handle things.
Those who were left of the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke the plates.
When WHAT HAPPENED, IF HAPPENED, happened, those from the Gulf and the Middle East whose grandparents had not fled in haste for fear they would be accused of burning the flames and for fear they would continue to live, opened restaurants serving labneh and yogurt.
Let each act according to his gifts.
Ailinn had only heard ballads, and it was difficult for her to understand how the hurtful words that Kevern had just sung could ever be put into music.
Love was expressed through music.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe for the big-footed ones.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created the illusion of safety.
Not a word would pass through the sound insulation of the leaves of giant cabbage plants.
Still, Ailinn didn't understand.
Why would your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to put two fingers on his lips with Ailin.
Ailinn thought he was strange already.
“It was funny,” he said instead.
Ailinn shook her head in disbelief, and her hair covered Kevern's field of vision.
There's nothing to see in the whole world but Ailin's huge, black crow's hair.
There was nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say so," he said, but he didn't sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
Ailin seemed genuinely confused.
Are my legs that big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was still too early for that.
"I find you attractive because of your thick ankles," he tried to correct the situation.
I'm twisted in that sense.
This didn't help.
He wanted it to sound fun.
Often, when he wanted to have fun, the effect was quite different, because he, like his father, lacked the convincing charm with which the cruelty of jokes can be controlled.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
In spite of his loving eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and rose from her terrace chair, while pouring the receiver and spilling the wine they had just drunk.
The wine was only made of elderflower, so he could not use it as a reason for the collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed to shake like the leaves of a palm tree in a storm.
"And it is your thick head that fascinates me perversely," he said.
Except I don't feel like it.
Kevern felt sorry for Ailinn, both because of his own unnecessarily cruel words and because of the fear in her eyes at the moment when Ailinn decided to confront her.
Did Ailinn think he'd hit you?
He had never told Kevern about life in the icy northern archipelago where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that it had been basically the same as life here.
The same huge, icy sea that waved against them.
The same confused men, though still paler and more diabolical than their smuggler and disruptor grandparents, marched from pub to pub, ready to strike any woman who dared to oppose or tease them.
A thick head?
He'd still see a thick fist if he wasn't careful!
Suck first – kissing had become the most common word for the erotic encounter between a man and a woman; the antidote to meaningless love ballads pumping out the receiver – suck first and then attack.
Kevern thought that was too much, for the sucking itself was hostile.
Ailinn Solomons’ body language urged her to leave.
He pulled himself out of the deck chair like an old man.
Ailinn, too, felt exhausted, but the depth of Kevern’s grief surprised him.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailin followed him, just as his traveling companion watched Kevern from the upstairs window, a man who himself was the cause of his heavy life.
Adam leaving the garden, he thought.
He felt pity for Kevern and the men in general, although some of them had raised their hands against him to strike.
A back-turned, stooped, ashamed, beaten man who had lost all fighting spirit—why did he feel that the vision was so familiar to him, though he could not remember having seen it at any time before this moment?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, she looked at her feet.
A few years before the event, Esme Nussbaum, a brilliant and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher working at the Private Institute for the Measurement of General Opinion in Ofnow, conducted a short study of the persistence of low and moderate violence in areas of the country where a reduction, or even an end, to violence was most likely, given the money and energy spent on eradicating it.
“A great deal has already been accomplished, and a great deal remains to be done,” he wrote, “to smooth out the natural aggressiveness of a people who have fought and mostly won for thousands of years, especially in those abandoned and remote corners where, despite the church towers stretching across the hedges, human kindness has been rarely known over time.
However, some things cannot be completely eliminated.
The higher the tower, the lower its desires.
The nation weeps over sentimental ballads, devours stories of triumphs and swears by the virtues of married and family life, but at the same time old-fashioned cruelty keeps a relentless grip on both rural communities and urban cohabitation areas, and there is evidence of a new, more malevolent will to quarrel in our homes and workplaces.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to dramatize," his director commented after reading the full report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum looked down.
So I have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," said Esme Nussbaum.
You're a lesbian?
Ms Esme continued to plead her right not to answer personal questions.
A feminist?
Again the silence.
“I do not ask,” said Luther Rabinowitz, “because I am opposed to atheism, lesbianism, and feminism.
There is no prejudice in this workplace.
We are the servants of an open-minded society.
While a certain kind of hypersensitivity is completely acceptable and respectable in itself, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, such as what you just presented to me.
You obviously have something against the Church – and what you call cruelty or malice, others generally call natural energy and physical strength.
To repeat what happened, if it happened, as if it happened yesterday, if it happened at all, destroys the fundamental vitality of the earth.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind Rabinowitz’s head, a flamingo-pink LED signal proclaimed a guideline that Ofnow had been distributing to the country for the previous quarter of the century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, chat, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
“Speaking is better than silence, and the word sung is better than the one written, but nothing beats love.”
“I understand what you want to say,” Esme Nussbaum replied in a quiet voice, as she was sure her director had finished, “and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we imagine ourselves to be.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find ourselves repeating the same mistakes that originally led to WHAT HAPPENED IF HAPPENED.
This time, though, we will not pour out our anger and mistrust on others.
With his fingers, Luther Rabinowitz built a pyramid.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "in describing as 'mistakes' the actions our grandparents may or may not have done.
You also go too far in saying that they poured out their “hate and mistrust on others.”
Someone in your position shouldn’t have to be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we’re not talking about ‘us’ or ‘them’.
There was no ‘us’ or ‘others’.
It was a time of chaos, that's all we know about it.
"If we are quite honest, in that chaos," Esme ventured to go on, "no group in society can say that it has behaved well.
I'm not blaming anyone.
What was done was done, whether it was good or bad.
It was then.
There is no need to talk about it further – we agree on that.
And just as it is unnecessary to distribute accusations, there is also no need to make corrections, whether they are justified or not, and even if there is a way to make them.
But what is the past for if we don't learn from it --
The past exists so we can forget it.
If I may add one more thing --
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
“I’ll go through your report,” she said, indicating that it was time for Esme to leave.
The next day, as usual, when he went to work, he was struck by a motorcyclist on the sidewalk, who was described by passersby as "wicked and furious".
Coincidences happen.
Lesotho army denies planning attack; prime minister stays in South Africa
Lesotho's army officials have denied that they staged an attack to overthrow the government and said they were working against a police officer suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying the army had besieged his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The head of state travelled with his family to neighboring South Africa after he told them he had received a death threat.
The army's spokesman, Major Ntlele Ntoi, denied the attack and said the army was responding to a threat emanating from "political fanatics".
“Lesotho’s military took action after receiving multiple intelligence reports that some police forces were trying to arm young party fanatics when they were ready to cause trouble,” he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military’s actions looked like a “revolutionary attempt.”
"While no one has claimed to have overthrown the government by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defense Forces appear to be in every way consistent with the hallmarks of a revolutionary effort," he said.
Lesotho's army officials said the soldiers would return to their barracks on Sunday, and the capital was in a calm mood.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing leads the government in Thabane's absence.
Thabane says he believes he is being targeted because he has tried to fight corruption.
There have been tensions in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to disagreements between the government of the Grand Coalition.
He denies that he downplayed the power of the government, despite allegations to the contrary.
Kauppalehti: Microsoft to establish a data center in Uusimaa
The IT company Microsoft has set up a large data center in Uudellemaa in a location that the company refuses to specify.
In a statement to Microsoft media, the company said it did not disclose the location of all of its data centers for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the center is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It is an investment of hundreds of millions of dollars for Microsoft.
In public, Oulu or Kajaani had previously been chosen as the location of the centre.
Microsoft will completely close down its Oulu office, which will take up jobs for about 500 people.
In total, Microsoft has announced that it will lay off 1,050 jobs in Finland.
Camilla Lindfors, Microsoft’s chief communications officer, told STT that the company does not comment on how many employees will be employed by the new data center.
The establishment of a data centre in Uusimaa was announced Monday by Kauppalehti.
Man accused of hitting girl at traffic light crossing
A 78-year-old man has been charged with assaulting a three-year-old girl at a traffic light crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart is accused of assaulting a girl at an intersection in Pittenween, eastern Neuk.
Prosecutors said Stewart drove his Audi Q3 recklessly and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied the charges at the Dundee Sheriff’s Office.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC ordered the trial in January.
Four tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take pictures or video underwater, you have several device options to choose from.
The most affordable option is a water-resistant, compact point-and-shoot camera like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which cost around $300.
I myself took these pictures at a family party using several different cameras, each of which cost less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules that you should follow.
Always double-check your device.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery and other parts of the camera are sealed waterproof.
Additionally, set the camera’s shooting settings to match the images or video you take.
Some cameras or camera/camcorder combinations have a setting that optimizes underwater shooting conditions.
In addition – before you jump in the water, make sure how deep your device can take you.
Some cameras are only 5 feet deep, while others are 50 to 60 feet deep.
Check out both standard and waterproof models in our buying guide and digital camera reviews.
Take several pictures – many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD display that allows you to compose an image, while action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it’s hard to see underwater, and image composition can either succeed or fail.
So take several pictures.
If your camera also allows bracketing, which means taking multiple photos at once with different settings, take advantage of this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light decreases significantly deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a swimming pool, lake or ocean.
This also adds more color to your images; the deeper you go, the less colors you see.
Try to get close to the target.
This is an important piece of advice when photographing on land, but even more important under water because of the low light conditions.
This is very important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, that is, the photographer must be close to the subject in order for the subject to fill the entire image, including the frames.
China will not allow Hong Kong to choose its leaders, protesters vow revenge
The Chinese parliament on Sunday ruled that Hong Kong voters could not choose candidates for the 2017 election despite growing unrest over the need for democratic reform.
The decision is likely to spark long-awaited protests in Hong Kong’s business district after activists began planning and implementing the protests hours after the decision was published.
The decision of the Chinese National People's Congress effectively gives the Communists the power to root out any candidates who do not obey Beijing.
"This was to be expected, but it's still infuriating," said Democratic Party chairman Emily Lau, a lawmaker.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've been lying to the Hong Kong people.
It is clear that we are dealing with an autocratic regime.
Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the National People's Congress Committee, defended the Chinese regime, saying that general candidacy for the Hong Kong leader would be too "chaotic".
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom ceded Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised the people of the region that it would be able to choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
Chinese leaders say Sunday's decision was a democratic breakthrough, as it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but it also makes it clear that China wants to control the electoral process strictly through a nomination committee governed from Beijing.
Under the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be accepted.
In the summer leading up to the decision, Hong Kong hosted some of the region’s biggest and most conspicuous protests for years.
The campaign for democracy was largely driven by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to block the business district if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, just hours after the decision was published, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong’s main administration buildings.
At the rally, organizers announced that the movement was moving into a new era of civil disobedience and that they would create waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not give details, apparently fearing that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said the movement "considers the Occupy Central truce as a last resort that will only be adopted if there is no hope for dialogue and there is no other way out."
We are very sorry to announce that today the last chance for dialogue has been lost and the occupation of the centre will take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the Beijing announcement for days, and on Sunday security measures were tight near the government’s main buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, unrest is fuelled by the feeling that residents are slowly losing control of their city.
The wave of arrivals from the continent has caused competition for products and services.
There is also a fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are disappearing under growing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticised the Occupy Central movement because its protests threaten Hong Kong’s livelihood – the business world.
“The protest they’re talking about can lead to huge financial losses, depending on how many people take part and how long it lasts,” says Regina Ip, a lawmaker who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to see the worry that Hong Kong is slipping out of our hands.
Such an image would be bad for investment.
There have also been stories in the Chinese state media that Hong Kong’s democracy activists are the henchmen of the Western powers who are fomenting the revolution.”
This summer, activists held an informal referendum on voting rights, in which 780,000 people participated – more than a fifth of Hong Kong’s voters.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region.
US prom tradition hits UK universities: Private jets for new students
We’re excited to meet the demand by creating the UK’s first luxury mode of travel for today’s students.
In addition to the private jet, the company also offers other vehicles, such as the Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, to ensure that the customer can make their arrival at the university as memorable as possible.
According to Stewart, there is also a security aspect to the service.
The service is the best option for students who would otherwise be dragging their property across the country in end-to-end loaded cars.
When this is combined with the many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to offer today’s students the easiest and highest quality transportation possible to the University.
The company’s representative said reservations had not yet been received because the service had just been set up, but added that “students will begin placing orders in the next few weeks.”
The company believes there is demand for the service, even though most students pay <0xC2><0xA3>9,000 in tuition fees.
Today’s students are very different in terms of their expectations and aspirations from those who started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now more than ever, it’s important to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is just the way to do it.
However, the national student organization criticizes the service, which is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, vice president of the organization’s higher education division, “this service plan seems to be really far from the life of the student majority.”
Many students starting their studies this month are shocked by the cost of living, as the available financial aid in the form of loans and scholarships have lagged behind the huge rise in the cost of living. Only next we can start to think about where to find thousands to spend on something as simple as arriving on campus.
Ipswich "pig house" for sale
Real estate agents removed a picture of a house for sale in Suffolk when they noticed that a big pig was lying in the living room of the house.
The one bedroom house, priced at <0xC2><0xA3>120,000, is located on a private road in Ipswich.
The announcement included a picture of the living room where the pig leaned its head on the sofa.

"However, the image ended up in the ad by mistake and has since been removed," a company representative said.
In the announcement, Connells described the former meeting house as "a unique one-bedroom house".
Even though the real estate agency has removed the image from their website, it still shows up in ads.
The sale of the house has sparked interest on social media, where people have asked whether the pig is included in the price of the house.
Torres confirmed departure, Kagawa returns from ManU to Dortmund
Spanish striker Fernando Torres was confirmed to have left Chelsea, but his replacement stepped in with almost the same opening.
Chelsea have signed French club Loic Remy to a four-year contract with QPR.
According to press reports, the purchase price is EUR 13 million.
Torres, 30, will join AC Milan on a two-year loan.

Bulgarian prison staff to hold national protest
Hundreds of prison workers across Bulgaria protested in front of the justice ministry in the capital Sofia.
In a peaceful demonstration, they declared that they wanted to return to the old working rules, which were recently amended.
Salary increases will also be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice, Hristo Ivanov.
For a month now, prison officials have been symbolically protesting against the new working hours, saying that they want to go back to the old 24-hour system.
Despite a meeting between representatives of the Prison Workers’ Organisation and the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached on the matter, according to Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
Negotiations are ongoing,” Rosen Zhelyazkov, director of the Enforcement of Judgments Directorate-General, told BNR.
Members of the Ministry of the Interior’s Trade Union of Workers are also expected to join the protest.
Basketball: Fan encouragement almost too much: Sasu Sali almost fainted on the pitch
Basketball Sasu Salin was the embodiment of Finland’s victory today.
He was able to forget his pitch black U.S. game and beat the blood of Ukraine in the second half with his stagnant decisions.
But Salin transferred all the glory to the wolf fans and did it in style:
I almost fainted at the end of the course, the encouragement was so great.
In my eyes, nothing could be done.
The noise and the white crowd was almost too much for me.
Salin’s power moments included nine surfaces at a fast pace, ball pits, discs and stunts in every place where it happened.
I don't know how it happened, but I got into a flow state where everything worked out.
They just come from somewhere, now an incredibly important place, Sasu boasted.
That's my part.
Do all that.
It was great to see that others caught up.
It grabbed the whole gang.
Salin is the team’s cheerleader and creator of spirit, so it’s no wonder that his example lifted the whole team into a flight that was too much for the big and rough-handed Ukrainian five.
Finland at the World Cup after 32 years break: The last ones left me with an outrageous refereeing game
Heikki Montonen (right) was Finland's head coach at the 1982 World Cup in Argentina.
It’s been 32 years since the Finnish men’s national volleyball team last played in the World Cup.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer at the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was Finland’s second coach and current player-agent Jouni Parkkali was a regular player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament as if it were yesterday: it was a hot match against France in the group stage.
"The judge's game in that match was blatant," Kosonen recalled.
We had already won and both teams were already on the back line.
Suddenly, the game continued.
We lost it 2-3 times, and after that the shits went more crazy," Parkkali said.
Finland played under the command of head coach Heikki Montonen and ended up finishing 17th.
Now Finland is once again among the champions of the world, as the World Cup in Poland starts today on Saturday.
Many things have changed dramatically in international volleyball over the past 32 years.
The power ratings of the players are about the same as before, but there is more quality and skill now.
The average height of the players has also increased.
The game is even faster," Parkkali thought.
But what about in Poland?
The Finnish player material has expanded, and the burden can be shared.
I look forward to Finland coming out of the group stage.
Then it can be tough," Kosonen says.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were hit in a winning match against Tunisia.
Current player-agent Jouni Parkkali was a regular player in the World Cup.
Let's hope we're going to beat the 17th place.
South Korea and Tunisia should go down,” Parkkali said.
Reino Kosonen was the second coach of the national team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari K<0xC3><0xB6>rkk<0xC3><0xB6> ventilated in the match against Tunisia.
Sauna and evening devotion at the Buenos Aires Seamen's Church were part of the national team's programme at the 1982 World Cup.

Finnish tourists rescued a Cita dog from a mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all the praise"
When the Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and her dog got into trouble in the mountains on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo Soini bravely offered to help.
Over the weekend, Mikkelsen searched for “international heroes” on Facebook to thank his helpers once again.
In a public Facebook post, Mikkelsen said that a Cita dog who was with him in the mountains on Thursday hurt his paw.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk on steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to attract and pull it forward a little bit, but it just didn’t hold up,” Mikkelsen wrote in his post.
According to Mikkelsen, there was no help from the police, a nearby hotel or passers-by.
By nightfall, the situation was already threatening.
Luckily there were two hikers who were ready to help: Antti Soini from Tampere and his father Tuomo.
The men had visited Norway’s highest mountain, Galdh<0xC3><0xB8>piggen, and headed to their camp when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm for the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, Antti Soini says in his message to Ilta-Sanomat.
Soon a German man came along with a camping mat.
From the mattress, the Cita was given a stretcher to which the injured dog was attached.
A German man came a moment after us, after we had thought about what to do with the dog and carried the dog down the slope for a moment in his arms, Soini says.

The dog was carried down with the help of a camping mattress.
According to Soini, the performance was not physically heavy, but carrying on difficult terrain was slow.
After about an hour and a half, however, the Cita was happily brought down.
After the incident, Mikkelsen searched for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank them once again.
The phone rings answered him on Sunday, but the German man is apparently still unreachable.
I don’t know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen rejoices.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't have come back.
I would like to find these people because I feel like I didn’t thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all the praise and honor, and I will be forever grateful to them.
On Monday night, the sounds were already on their way home.
They had received some happy news from Mikkelsen: - Cita is already feeling better!

Genetic abnormalities are often misdiagnosed.
For years, a British woman feared death because of a misdiagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought for most of her youth that she had only a few years left to live because she had been diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, he suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), a group of hereditary diseases that damage the nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to the charity Charity CMT UK, misdiagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases because so little is known about them.
It is estimated that around 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which causes symptoms such as muscle weakness, trouble walking and toe pain.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he thought he had Friedreich’s Ataxia (FA), which has a very poor survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would be in a wheelchair before he turned 18 and die before he reached the age of 30.
A 51-year-old mother of two says, “When I was a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same things as everyone else.
I fell every day and it took me longer than anyone else.
I was never able to skate or skate with other kids, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently than other kids.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he underwent several Achilles tendon surgeries to straighten his legs, and when the doctor left the room, he quickly glanced at his research papers, which said that he was suffering from FA.
“I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I got home, I checked the medical records in the library and wrote to the FA,” she said.
When I received information from them, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I was going to be in a wheelchair by the age of 18 and die before I was 25, and in the meantime I would slowly lose my ability to function.
I went through this on my own and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by the age of 17, he found that his walking had not worsened as much as he had thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, “Girl, I don’t think you have this disease, because otherwise you’d be in a wheelchair by now.”
I think you're suffering from something far less dangerous.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
“When they explained to me what CMT is, I thought I had been put off,” she says.
Charity CMT UK organises CMT Month to draw attention to the disease.
100 Migrants Found in Coal Car in Macedonia
Macedonian authorities have found more than 100 illegal migrants on a coal-carrying train, the Interior Ministry said on Monday.
Most of the migrants were Syrians and Iraqis.
The train was coming from Greece.
The migrants were found late Sunday in Veles, central Macedonia.
It was hard to communicate with most of them.
They didn’t know where they were, where they came from and where they were going,” Interior Ministry spokesman Ivo Koteski said.
According to the police, the migrants had paid about 3,000 euros each to get to Greece, and another 800-900 euros to get to Serbia.
A large number of illegal immigrants travel through Macedonia, which has a population of two million, on their way to Western Europe.
Three million people have fled the bloody civil war in Syria.

British stars Paul McCartney and David Bowie, for example, have appealed to the Scots to remain part of Britain.
In the Gallup, supporters of independence have been at a loss.
The difficulties of department stores continued in mid-summer - Kotimaa uutiset - Ilta-Sanomat
The decline in department store trade continued also in July, says the Finnish Grocery Trade Association.

Sales grew most in small stores and large supermarkets.
The turnover of department stores and hypermarkets decreased by more than two per cent during the first half of the year, January-July.
In contrast, the sales of daily consumer goods have increased by nearly one per cent.
Joan Rivers' Family 'Wishes the Best'

The case has sparked widespread public reaction, with Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa offering support online.
Areva-Siemens: Olkiluoto Reactor 3 to be completed in mid-2016
Areva has provided Teollisuuden Voima with an updated timetable for Olkiluoto 3.
According to Areva, the project’s recent delays are mainly due to the approval of the reactor’s automation systems.
The project is already years behind schedule.
In May, TVO did not give any estimate of the completion time of the third reactor.
Nastola donated 1.4 hectares of beach plot to Bottas - value about 60,000 euros
The municipal government of Nastola donated a 1.4-hectare plot of land to Formula One driver Valtteri Bottas from Villähde on the shores of Lake Kärkjärvi.
The municipal government showed a fair sense of sportsmanship and was unanimous in its decision.
There were no gravel noises at the meeting when the plot was decided, says Mayor Pauli Syyrakki.
Bottas gift plot has the farm buildings - a total of seven pieces.
This year, all but one of them will be removed.
Bottas has promised to build a holiday home on the site within two years.
We are delighted that he has enjoyed his birthplace and wants to continue to be here.
Valtteri has visited primary schools every year to talk about his sports career and life.
I hope it will continue, the mayor said.
The mayor estimates that the monetary value of the beach plot is EUR 40000–60000.
The beach is shallow and child friendly.
The area has been owned by the municipality for more than ten years.
Over the decades, Nastola has with varying success kept the successful in sports with the help of gift plots in the municipality.
World champion Aki Parviainen and world champion of aerobics Tuuli Matinsalo got the detached plots from the municipality and built fabulous detached houses.
However, they did not stay in Nastola but sold their property and moved away.
Parviainen and Matinsalon came to Nastola for work and then moved elsewhere after their life situation changed.
Bottas is a native of Nastola and his situation is different, Syarakki says and believes Bottas will stay in his home municipality.
Hull hires forward Hernandez for record
Hull invested the club's record amount of money in the acquisition of Uruguayan national teamman Abel Hernandez.
Hernandez will switch from Palermo to Hull for <0xC2><0xA3>9.5 million.
The agreement is for three years.
Hernandez scored 14 goals last season when Palermo won Serie B and reached the Italian top flight.
With the Uruguayan national team, he has scored seven goals in 14 games.
At last summer’s World Cup, Hernandez came in two games for a change on the pitch.
“Abel is a fantastic purchase and shows how far we’ve come in a short time,” Hull coach Steve Bruce said.
On Monday, Hull said he had also acquired Senegal national team captain Mohamed Diamen from West Ham.
Russian Space Experiment Fails: Geckos Sent on Sex Trip Killed
The five little geckos sent into space by Russia to breed have died, the Russian Federation’s space agency Roscosmos said in a statement.
The Geckos travelled on the Foton-M4 satellite for more than a month and a half.
The satellite returned to Earth on Monday morning.
The purpose of the experiment was to investigate the reproductive capacity and use of geckos in a weightless state.
One male gecko and four females participated in the experiment.
Although the experiment sounds strange, its purpose was serious.
The effects of weightlessness, for example, on the development of gecko eggs, are still poorly understood.
The effects on geckos can be used to predict what kind of effects weightlessness would have on a person during a longer stay in a similar state, the New Statesman explained in July.
According to Roscosmos, the geckos' time of death and the cause or causes of death will be determined.
Interfax news agency reported that passengers who were dubbed “sex geeks” froze to death.
The fact that the fruit flies that travelled on the same Foton-M4 also survived the trip with difficulty, and also had offspring, is a further indication of the surprise.
France arrests terrorist suspect at Nice airport
France arrested a man suspected of terrorism at Nice airport on Saturday.
The 22-year-old is believed to have been a recruiter for a jihadist group in Syria.
The French authorities announced this on Sunday.
Authorities tracked him down after he lured a 16-year-old girl into Syria.
The girl was supposed to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border.
The airline did not believe the girl’s explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but alerted authorities.
The authorities contacted the girl’s father, who was completely unaware of her intentions, and told the authorities that the family had no family in Turkey.
The man is believed to be from Chechnya, but he now lives in France.
French intelligence officials had followed the man’s actions before.
In France, authorities have been concerned that radicalised young people attracted to wars in Iraq or Syria pose a security risk to France as well.
It is estimated that some 800 French citizens or listed individuals in France have travelled to, returned from, or are planning to leave Syria during the last conflict.
We have a good chance of winning.
The basketball national team’s hopes for an extra place are at stake as Finland faces Ukraine in its second match of the World Cup today.
If the opening loss to the United States had been expected, Ukraine would be one of the countries from which Finland should take the necessary profits.
Ukraine is a good team, but I believe we have a good chance of winning,” Petteri Koponen predicts.
Ukraine beat the Dominican Republic 72-62 in its first match of the Games on Saturday.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, under whose command Ukraine plays aggressive basketball.
The key player in Ukraine is game director Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a 100-meter world champion from three years ago.
Jeter scored 16 points against the Dominican Republic.
Pooh Jeter is a fast guy, but we’ve played against them before and we have to get our standard defense in order,” Koponen said.
Hanno M<0xC3><0xB6>tt<0xC3><0xB6>lä promised that Finland would play better than yesterday’s defeat to the United States.
We need to rediscover our strengths.
I can guarantee that there will be a normal wolf pack on the field,” M<0xC3><0xB6>tt<0xC3><0xB6>lä said.
Alleged Hollywood star's nudes are spreading online, some confirmed to be real
There are a number of nude images on the Internet that allegedly depict well-known celebrities.
Actress Jennifer Lawrence has been the victim of a “nudity campaign.”
TMZ has released an angry comment from representatives of Lawrence, which seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a blatant invasion of privacy.
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes (on the Internet) stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence will be prosecuted, the representatives threaten.
According to TMZ, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the images of her are genuine.
She took these pictures years ago with her husband.
When I know that those images were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine the gruesome effort that was made to do this.
“I feel compassion for everyone who was hacked,” he wrote.
Victoria Justice has called the images under her own name fake.
There are also real or fake nudes of Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
Honka-goalkeeper criticized his own: "They don't work hard enough to get out of here"
Football club FC Honka is currently in last place in the Veikkausliiga.
Goalkeeper Walter Viitala's comments after Sunday's VPS match are a good description of the club's confusing current situation.
I haven't had a goalkeeper coach in four months.
But you have to adapt to everything," Viitala said after a 1-2 loss.
Honka made a lot of defensive mistakes in the match, especially in the first half.
The goalkeeper Viitala was not pleased with the bad defensive play.
Player traffic has been busy this summer in Hongka, which is why the defenders in front of Viitala have also changed frequently.
With player roulette, many young players have also been given opportunities that they might not even deserve.
"Some of them don't work hard enough to get out of here," Viitala snorted without naming a single player.
Honga’s head coach Shefki Kuqi agreed to some extent with Viitala.
"I said after the game to certain players that if you come to practice and games to have fun and you think you're a league player and you don't have to work, you're probably on the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of kids time to play.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of it, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also reminded that players cannot be expected to be immediately successful when their teammates are constantly changing.
This season we have not had the same team twice in a row.
Especially in defense, the group has changed.
That is the main reason why we are in this position," Kuqi said.
Honka is a series jumbo after the VPS loss, tied with the second last TPS.
There are still seven rounds left in the Veikkausliiga, so Espoons still have time to avoid falling into the First.
I've never dropped a team, and I'm not going to drop one now.
We will definitely not fall out of this series," Viitala said.
Lars von Trier is making a TV series after decades of hiatus.
Film director Lars von Trier is returning to the series.
The Danish director is working on a TV series called The House That Jack Built.
Louise Vesth, the producer of Trier’s films, said Monday at the Venice Film Festival.
The production company Zentropa has announced that filming of the series should begin in 2016.
Trier is said to be working on the script starting this autumn.
The series is in English.
Trier’s long-time partner, producer Peter Aalb<0xC3><0xA6>k Jensen, who is known for his tough sales pitches, also describes the mysterious project in a press release.
According to him, a similar series "has never been seen and will never be seen."
"Hold your breath," Aalb<0xC3><0xA6>k Jensen said in a statement.
Lars von Trier, 58, has been known for his controversial media appearances and films such as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac in recent years.
In the 1990s, he directed a television series.

Today I had a great feeling.
This is what basketball player Sakari Pehkonen said in 1995, when Finland had played in the European Championship against France at the Maroussi ballpark in Athens.
Pyhkonen did not exaggerate.
I remember the game when I was there.
So were the approximately one hundred Finns who shouted noise to a crowd of 20,000, otherwise an empty hall.
What would you have said 19 years later after the World Cup?
There are 80 times more Finnish fans in Bilbao.
The 1995 European Championship was a defining moment for Finnish basketball.
The men made their way to the final tournament by winning the Russian qualifier match at the Helsinki Sports Hall.
That victory opened the door to the cream of Europe.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people, like Hanno M<0xC3><0xB6>tt<0xC3><0xB6>lä.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann raised M<0xC3><0xB6>tt<0xC3><0xB6>lä to the final tournament team.
A solution that many disagreed with.
Now it can be said that Dettmann was wise from afar, even though everything did not go according to the script.
After Athens, the national basketball team dived deep.
The total number of Finns at the Athens Games was reportedly a little over a hundred.
This included journalists, relatives of the players, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
There are journalists, relatives and coaches in Bilbao, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to incomprehensible proportions.
I don’t think anyone can give an exact figure for the Finnish race tourists.
Estimates ranged from 7,500 to 10,000.
Whatever the number is, it is an incomprehensible number.
Here's an explanation for sports sociologists.
In a global economy, businesses move across borders.
In sports, there is still a chance to look at how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can visit to see how our girls and boys are succeeding in the world,” says Hannu Itkonen, professor of sports sociology.
Surely there are Finns looking for an experience both in Spain and at the World Volleyball Championships in Poland.
Shared experience.
But that doesn't explain everything.
The sport itself has to be attractive.
Itkonen makes sports part of popular culture.
It is a lower threshold to go to sports competitions than to visit Berlin to see art.
Without success, the masses will not be able to move.
Let's go back to 1995.
At the time, head coach Dettmann challenged the basketball federation and the players to throw themselves into top-level sports professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed and the national team was put on a pedestal.
The volleyball team made the same move a little earlier.
They both enjoy the fruits of their labor.
As Itkonen says, both sports have succeeded in commercializing their top-of-the-line sports in which the holy trinity works: sports media sponsors.
The public will also be interested.
And the media has taught us what such carnivalistic support is, Itkonen points out.
Can ball sports also transfer this massive interest to domestic leagues?
Basketball and volleyball are played to an average of hundreds or slightly more than a thousand spectators.
Itkonen thinks the question is a good one, and does not necessarily give an answer that promises to be very good for the species.
The second school believes that interest is shifting.
The other is the one who doesn’t want a sweet belly full.
This group is ready for an adventure trip to the World Championships, but in their basic thinking, domestic leagues are not of dual interest.
It's a challenge for the people in the middle of the rush.
Bottas plot secured - almost 1.5 hectares from the lake shore
Nastola awards formula driver Valtteri Bottas with a beach house plot.
The municipal government unanimously approved the handover of the 1.4-hectare site at its meeting on Monday.
In the future, a free-time residence will be built on the plot.
Nastola has been following Bottas’s success since his karting days.
He is considered a good ambassador to market Lahti, the Lahti region and Nastola.
The gift plot is located in Koiskala, by Lake Kärkjärvi.
It has become the property of the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate transaction.
There are seven buildings in demolition in the area, of which the municipality will demolish six at the expense of the municipality by the end of this year.
Bottas achieved his fourth podium finish in the Belgian Formula 1 this year.
He is fifth in the World Cup.
Bottas is a native of Nastola and lived in Villähde as a child.
He currently lives in England but goes to Nastola whenever he is free from formulas.
Bottas has visited secondary schools and youth facilities.
Design smart clothes come – but hardly for the poor
It is currently testing them at the U.S. Open in New York.
Ralph Lauren’s smart-shirts are tested by ballplayers on the field, but Marcus Giron, one of the top amateurs in college football, also wears one.
He says the shirt helps him monitor his progress and regulate his recovery.
Silver sensors are woven into the nylon shirt, which transmits information to the block in the shirt and then to a smartphone or tablet.
Sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythm, stress and steps.
Before throwing the shirt into the washing machine, remove the central block.
The fashion house has not given an exact time for the shirt to go on sale, nor has it even hinted at its price, Tech Times reported.
Raph Lauren is not the only company that invests in smart clothing.
Athos, California, has launched a smart shirt and smart shorts.
They measure heart rate, breathing and muscle work.
The clothes cost $100 each, and the thumb-sized central unit they require costs $200.
It was also written by Red Orbit.
A smart way to save on textbooks
With the cost of college books in the U.S. exceeding $1,000 for many students, Matt Schroeder, soon to enter his second year of study, came up with a smart way to save on costs.
He developed a system in which students in later years borrow their books for a nominal fee instead of selling them immediately.
“My math book would normally have cost $180; I paid $10 to use it for the whole semester, plus a big sandwich,” says Schroeder, 19, who studies at Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder says his books for the past semester would normally have cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the University Board of Trustees, the average student spends more than $1,200 per year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many ways to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online stores and creative approaches like Schroeder’s idea.
More and more students are renting textbooks, allowing them to use the book for the whole semester and paying significantly less than students who buy the book.
According to Neebo Inc, a company with more than 250 campus bookstores, textbook rental has doubled since 2011.
Statistics on the industry reveal that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores in the past spring were rental books, said Trevor Meyer, president of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus bookstores.
Here are the simplest ways to save money.
Online Shops
In online stores, you can only get a new book for one-third of the price it would cost in a bookstore on campus.
The ninth edition of Calculus by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is nearly $290, but the book is available for $239.99 at Chegg.com.
Buy used
Used books are a good option if the reader is not bothered by the notes and worn appearance of others.
For example, the book "Calculus" can be purchased online at Chegg.com for $93.49.
Brigham Young University senior student Matt Casaday, 25, says he bought the book “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business” from Amazon.com for just $0.42.
The new book would have cost $48.
Ingrid Bracey, director of Amherst’s College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts, and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if previous editions can be used on the course.
Sometimes the reforms in the new edition are not essential for teaching.
In this case, the old edition can only be found for a fraction of the price that should be paid for the new one.
In addition to the Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
You should consider renting textbooks if you take good care of them, remember to return them and do not need them after completing the course.
By renting, you can save more than 80% of the price of a new book.
For example, renting a “Calculus” book for the whole semester costs about $20.
Check out the rules of the rental company, such as notes, highlighter use and wear-and-tear charges.
Renter, be careful: if you forget to return the book, the late fee may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-books
The purchase of e-books instead of ordinary paper books may also be an option.
Sometimes these books are rented, in which case the owner of the e-book is paid for access to them, for example, Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc bookstores.
You can get Calculus as an e-book for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, many students of literature save the most, because a number of classics today can be downloaded for free, while books in the field of science and technology can be very expensive.
It’s worth comparing the different sellers, whichever option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who is about to start at Pepperdine Law School, recommends using the book’s ISBN number to figure out the price, as it will help ensure that you are looking for the right book.
Before you order online, make sure the book is definitely in stock, Gault says.
He learned this the hard way.
The delivery of the book he had purchased was frozen for four weeks, and he was eventually forced to purchase the book at full price from the university bookstore.

Almost twice as many people died in the fires compared to last year
Almost twice as many people have died in fires this year compared to last year.
According to the Finnish Rescue Association (Spek), so far 55 people have been killed in 49 fires.
Last year, there were 31 fire deaths.
Most of the dead, 36, were men.
There were 11 people over the age of 65.
According to the organization’s fire deaths statistics, the last time the situation was worse was in 2009, when by the end of August 64 people had died in the fires.
The majority of fire deaths occur in homes.
There have been 17 fire deaths in blocks of flats, 21 in detached houses and seven in terraced houses and other detached houses.
Spek reminds us of the repetition of home fire safety.
According to Spek, the functionality of at least all home fire alarms should be ensured.
In addition, everyone should check that the fire extinguishing equipment is easy to use.
There must also be an unobstructed exit from all the spaces in the home.
Children should also be told what electrical devices they can use when they are home alone.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
The opposition to the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the city centre of Newport for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, around 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events over the weekend and spoke with demonstrators who had arrived from Belgium.
Children rescued by plane from Australia’s Blue Mountains
TWO teenage hikers were lifted to safety after being stranded overnight in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went hiking after noon on Sunday to Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
Relatives worried about the young people who had not returned home and called the police at 8 p.m.
A search party consisting of local police and helpers was sent to look for the young people, and at around 11 p.m., the two were found near the Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had injured her knee, and the man had fallen and hit his head.
The police spent the night with the couple, and they were lifted to safety on Monday morning.
The hikers were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital and were in stable condition.
Ukrainian troops withdraw from Luhansk airport
Ukrainian forces have withdrawn from Luhansk airport.
According to the Ukrainian military, the soldiers were ordered to retreat.
According to Ukraine, the paratroopers have clashed fiercely with Russian tanks on the ground.
According to a military spokesman, the gunfire has been so accurate that the shooters are likely to be Russian professional soldiers.
In the past 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have been killed.
A Ukrainian patrol vessel that was hit by artillery in the Sea of Azov off the southeast of Ukraine sank this morning, the border guard said.
Eight marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The border guards were not sure where the ship had been fired from.
Separatists said on social media that they had shot at the ship.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would not attack Ukraine.
Lavrov insisted, however, that Ukrainian forces should immediately withdraw to positions from which they could not fire on civilians.
According to the Foreign Minister, today’s talks in Minsk between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE should result in an immediate and unconditional ceasefire.
Lavrov also said that Russia would respond to possible new economic sanctions.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economy, our social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will draw conclusions from the actions of our partners,” Lavrov said.
Heavy rains caused flooding in Malm<0xC3><0xB6> and Copenhagen
The streets in Malm<0xC3><0xB6> and Copenhagen were flooded on Sunday as heavy rains hit southern Sweden and Denmark.
Floodwaters cut off several roads, disrupted traffic, and buried cars beneath them.
On Sunday, authorities estimated that it might take some time for the flood to subside, even though the rains were forecast to stop by Monday.
Heavy rains caught the Swedish authorities by surprise, and no weather warnings were issued in advance.
Ari Mustala, an on-call meteorologist at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, estimated that the rain front that affected the area was very local.
The rain area looks narrow and stationary.
No wonder it was hard to predict.
French Socialists should ‘be quiet and help France’, Francois Hollande’s chief backer says
Valls called on the deeply divided left to "show their feelings" for a troubled socialist president whose new government could not win the approval of the French majority.
The President deserves the respect of all, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"It's our job to stay by his side," Valls said, and deserved a round of applause.
As a reassuring gesture, the prime minister called on the government to leave the controversial 35-hour working week in France alone, despite a controversial proposal earlier this week by the new economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, that the rule should be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to cooperate with the government.
However, Justice Minister Christiane Taubira caused discord by appearing at a meeting of dissenting Socialist MPs and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing "France to give up hope for the future".
The leader of the far-right National Front, Marine Le Pen, ridiculed the Socialists' continuing disagreement with each other and said he did not believe the new Valls government would last more than a few months.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande may have gone to war on phone calls, but so has Manuel Valls, whose duty it was to form a new government after the previous one did not last even the summer.
"And the new government won't last until the fall or winter," Le Pen told reporters.
He reiterated his party's proposal to dissolve Parliament and considered his party's victory in early elections certain, and he himself would be ready to lead the party.
The French ruling party suffered a landslide defeat in the March municipal elections and the far-right held the top spot in the May European elections.
According to a poll in the Sunday Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party may split into several competing groups before the end of Hollande’s term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Po University, warned that the French would soon lose patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and record levels of unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public needs to be quick to see that change is happening," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
Finnish hosts Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda were badly disappointed in the recorded part of the programme.
Last Thursday, the Huomenta Suomi programme posted a funny video on its Facebook page about the recordings made on Thursday.
In the video, presenters Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pou try to record the Good Morning Finland commercial puff from the next day's broadcast, but the recording doesn't go quite right.
Alm-Siira is baffled when she tries to say the word budget, and her baffling also causes Pouda and Rahkola to lose their nerve time and time again.
And these heroes should be allowed to broadcast live tomorrow, too, says the Good Morning Finland Facebook post.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been liked and shared more than 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked at Lehtikuvan kuva photo agency, placed third in the series of portraits in 1972.
Prime Minister of Israel Golda Meir.
On Fredrikinkatu in Helsinki, a meeting of the Socialist International was held in May 1971.
There were a lot of heads of state at the meeting and the security measures were enormous.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went with her.
However, at the beginning of the meeting, we were given over five minutes to photograph.
I took this picture from five feet away.
The light and background were on.
I knew right away that this time I was successful.
You can see from Meiri’s face that the leaders of the Middle East have had a difficult time before.
At that time, the competition was successful with pictures of well-known people or events.
It’s great that nowadays you can also succeed with other images, as long as you have an idea and a visual twist.
This is the second best picture I have taken.
The best is the fall of Lasse Virén from the Munich Olympics.
I didn't send it to the competition.
Dissertation: The Aarnio investigation has already cost more than five million euros
The investigation of the legality of the activities of the Helsinki Police Drugs Unit has already cost more than five million euros and required 30-50 person-years of work.
This is the view of Jyri Rajamäki in his doctoral dissertation on information technology.
Rajamäki argues that the monitoring of the legality of police activities and the prevention of crime in general could be significantly improved by combining the IT systems of investigation and judicial proceedings.
According to Rajamäki, modern technology enables multiple use of forensic material.
He states that it is possible to build a system in which the information collected for the purpose of solving a crime is automatically electronic evidence that meets the chain of evidence and at the same time enables comprehensive judicial review.
The dissertation will be examined on Saturday.
Yle: The 1999 concept of vegetarian food was forgotten on the school wall: "Fish and chicken foods included in the vegetarian diet"
A picture of a special bulletin on the wall of the Naistenmatka school in Pirkkala caused a food frenzy on social media, Yle says on its website.
Vegetarians!
The vegetarian diet includes fish and chicken dishes during the school lunch.
Only when there is meat on the list, we prepare a vegetarian option!
This is according to a 15-year-old statement on the school wall.
You can see the picture from here.
The image that has spread on social media has prompted people to send out indignant feedback to the municipality of Pirkkala.
Arja Vaarma, Head of Food and Cleaning Services, says to Yle that the note left on the wall is not true and should have been removed a long time ago.
Apparently, before my arrival, there was once such an idea, which was discussed with health care at the time.
Every student gets a meal according to their wishes, he says.
Today, in schools in Pirkkala, students are offered a vegetarian option only with the permission of their parents and a certificate from a doctor or public health nurse confirming the vegetarian diet.
Vaarma justifies the decision to Yle by the fact that young people’s vegetarian experiments may leave their nutrition deficient, and the lack of meat or chicken may cause astonishment to the parents of the students.
Norwegian Cruise close to $3 billion worth of Prestige Cruise contract
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world’s third-largest cruise company, is in negotiations to buy its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc. for $3 billion, according to figures provided by people closely involved.
With the acquisition, Norwegian Cruises, with a market value of $6.8 billion, will have access to luxury cruise ships and wealthy customers of Prestige Cruises as it continues to compete with the larger companies Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to sources, information about a possible agreement may be published as early as this week, although it is also possible that the negotiations will not produce any results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want their names to be made public because the negotiations are not taking place in public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment and an Apollo representative declined to comment.
Based in Miami, Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships with a route map covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue grew 13 percent from 2012 to 2013, when it was $2.57 billion.
The Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, sails under the brand names Oceania and Regent with a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its revenue in 2013 was $1.2 billion, which is six percent more than in the previous year.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the rise of emerging economies such as China and India in the coming years.
Companies are competing to become the number one choice for these new customers when choosing a cruise.
Prestige Cruises registered its first share issue on the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has held the majority of the company’s shares since the 2007 transaction, which was valued at $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded with its current line-up in 2000 as a result of its merger with the cruise company Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), an entertainment and casino company owned by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the information published, Genting held 28 % of the company, Apollo 20 % and private equity investment company TPG Capital LP 8 % from the end of June onwards.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises together account for 82% of North American cruise capacity, according to the registration document issued by Prestige Cruise at the time of the share issue.
The Tampere City Government is dealing with the matter today.
Animalia hopes that the city government will strongly support the initiative.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, Executive Director of Animalia, who is preparing a doctoral dissertation for the University of Tampere, the dolphinariums in Finland and around the world should end soon.
Fortunately, in recent years, there has been a widespread belief around the world that keeping advanced mammals such as dolphins in dolphinariums is neither animal-friendly nor ethically sustainable.
We hope that this view will also be reflected in Tampere.
The abolition of the dolphinarium is not only a question of animal rights, but also of Tampere’s image as a tourist destination,” Tuomivaara points out.
According to Tuomivaara, the death of the Näsi dolphin reinforces the demands for the closure of dolphinarium operations.
Näsi’s death is a sad continuation of the dark history of Särkänniemi Dolphinarium.
It is time to put an end to the deaths, close down the dolphin prison and start looking into how the Tampere dolphins could be moved to a restricted sea area, a kind of dolphin shelter, Tuomivaara insists.
Näsi didn’t have time to experience a return to the dolphins’ original habitat, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Särkänniemi will have time to experience more than just the uninspired concrete, Tuomivaara hopes.
Animalia aims to ban the use of all wild animal species in circuses in the upcoming comprehensive reform of the Animal Welfare Act.
This includes dolphins.
To support this demand, Animalia’s Executive Director Tuomivaara will participate in a demonstration on behalf of dolphins on 1 September.
The demonstration at the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki will take place against the start of the dolphin hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting season, about 2,300 dolphins are cruelly captured or killed each year, either for use as dolphinariums or for food.
Putin calls on Kiev to open talks on new state with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday called on the Ukrainian government to stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "statehood" of the severing region, Russian news sources say.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-held territory of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine must be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking population the power to defend its own rights and interests.
Putin’s call for Kiev’s government to negotiate with pro-Russian rebels on an equal footing is in line with his apparent strategy since the violence began five years ago: to help the separatists take over the region and, in so doing, to force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly proclaimed Novorossiya independence so that it can head for Russia instead of for the West.
In an interview with the state TV channel Channel 1, Putin condemned the efforts of the Ukrainian army to retake the separatist-held eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were captured by separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula of Ukraine on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently christened the region “Novorossiya”, “New Russia” – a term reminiscent of the days of glory preceding the revolutions of the Russian Empire.
According to the Russian Itar-Tass news agency, Putin said the planned peace talks would be an “illusion” as long as Ukrainian politicians conducted campaigns for parliamentary elections on October 26 and government forces attacked civilians in separatist-controlled areas.
"We must immediately start wide-ranging negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the organization of society and the status of the state of South-East Ukraine, so that the interests of the people living there are taken into account," he says.
According to Peskov, Putin’s reference to “statehood” is related to the broader independence that has been discussed for months with Kiev’s leadership in an effort to dispel fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need,” Peskov said.
Peskov said that talks cannot be held between Ukraine and Russia on this issue, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The Kremlin spokesman’s memo, which was intended to correct a “misinterpretation” of Putin’s comments, stressed that the Russian regime’s handling of the separatist uprising in the eastern regions is different from that of Crimea, effectively taking over the region, where the majority of the population of 2 million people is ethnically Russian.
It would be considerably more difficult for Moscow to include even the Donetsk or Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, because the majority of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russian and because, according to pre-conflict polls, the majority of the population was in favour of staying in Ukraine.
Independence, which Russian diplomats have discussed in international fora, would give Ukrainian local governments the right to agree on their own trade agreements and foreign relations, giving the Kremlin virtually control of the territory that links Russia to Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was annexed to Russia five months ago, is home to Russia's main fleet, as well as commercial seaports and historic coastal sites.
In the region between Rostov and Crimea, there are also mines, factories and metal smelters that produce products vital to the Russian army.
In his inauguration speech on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukrainian lawmakers – after new elections – consider constitutional changes to increase the decision-making power of regions outside Ukraine’s core region over their own economy and the status of languages.
However, his vision of independence seems to be radically different from that of separatists, perhaps armed and incited by the Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin made his latest call to the Kiev government for talks with pro-Russian rebels as equal partners after the rebels advanced further last week after Russian tanks and troops invaded eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area off the Azov Sea.
Ukrainian security officials fear that the seizure of the Russian-backed separatist city of Novoazovsky is the beginning of a larger effort to seize the entire strategic coastal region as far as Crimea.
It has led to a massive reinforcement of the city of Mariupol by civilians and military personnel. Mariupol, with a population of half a million, is known as a steel-producing port city, located between Novoazovsk and a narrow stretch of land leading to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday in Brussels to European Union leaders, pleading for further action to prevent future Russian insults in Ukraine, the former republic of the Soviet Union, which has been independent for 23 years.
“We will soon reach a point of no return,” Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take any decisions on direct action; the leaders called for additional sanctions to be drawn up in the event of the Ukrainian crisis re-igniting in unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in the Ilovaysk region after two Russian armored units and 1,000 soldiers moved into the Donetsk region last week to reinforce the struggling separatists, General Andriy Lysenko, a representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
According to Lysenko, the first of 63 Ukrainian soldiers besieged by Russia in Ilovaysk was replaced by 10 Russian parachutists, who were captured in the territory of Ukraine a week ago.
The opening goal for Milan was scored by Keisuke Honda in the seventh minute of the game.
In the second half, Sulley Muntari scored first and Jeremy Menez scored a penalty.
Lazio also scored a goal in the final moments of the game, but goalkeeper Diego Lopez saved Antonio Candreva's shot.
He moved to Milan from Real Madrid for the season.
In Milan's former striker Inzagh's coaching debut, the San Siro stadium was only half finished.
The match was attended by 39,000 spectators.
Australian Celebrities and Gabi Grecko in a Nude Image Scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has said he is shocked that hackers may have stolen nude photos of his fiancée and Hollywood A-lister, Gabi Grecko.
The entertainment world has been teetering since a series of nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence were posted on the internet following a widespread celebrity image hacking scandal.
Hacker is said to have a total of 60 nude photos of the Hunger Games star Lawrence and other superstars, including top model Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Photos of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne-based Grecko have also apparently been stolen in connection with an iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrity names on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, told Confidential: "This is disgusting."
All personal contacts and photos should remain private.
It is shameful that private data can be stolen and disseminated.
Grecko, who is based in New York City, is reported to have commented on the incident in an online journal as "shameful" and to have said the victims "feel ashamed".
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with his previous boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of Palmer topless by the pool.
Palmer's film credits include "Love and Honor" with co-star Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actor Browning did not comment on the hacked images yesterday.
A Lawrence spokesman told TMZ that “this is an audacious invasion of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen tweeted: “Publishing photos stolen from a mobile phone is no different than selling a stolen product.”
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible from a purely legal point of view.
Finland played almost like at home and rose to a sensational victory over Cuba at the World Volleyball Championships.
Look at the fanfare.
Katowice in Poland was white on Monday: not red and white for a Pole, but blue and white for a Finn.
According to STT, Finland’s victory was followed by nearly 2,000 Finnish supporters at the Spodek arena.
It was like playing at home.
The fans had such a big impact on our game,” Finnish captain Antti Siltala told STT.
Finland was already losing 0-2 in the match, but rose to victory 3-2.
In the fourth round, Finland made a miraculous rise from behind six points.
Cuba already led 16-10, but after that the Finns got on top of the ecstasy.
However, a few hundred Finnish fans were disappointed when the charter plane was unable to land in Katowice due to heavy fog.
