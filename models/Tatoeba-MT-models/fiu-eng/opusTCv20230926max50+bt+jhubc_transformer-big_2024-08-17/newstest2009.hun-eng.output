The Prague Stock Exchange is down by the end of trading
The Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses after the crash this morning.
Transactions with shares of the Czech Energy Company (<0xC4><0x8C>EZ) amounted to nearly half of the usual daily trading volume.
The Prague stock exchange continued its slump on Monday from the start of trading on Tuesday, when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, Wall Street shares are falling.
This is also the reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote in the US House of Representatives, which refused to support the stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Fall of shares in Asia
Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic fall in stocks on Tuesday, though some of the losses over the course of the day were eventually cancelled.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng stock market index posted almost four percent during trading, but later wiped out some of the losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which monitors Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, while the markets in Shanghai were closed.
The Sydney stock market lost more than five percent, but losses eventually dropped to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan stock market fell 3.6 percent, according to the index.
"The timing of the US rescue operation is uncertain and will affect the world's financial markets," said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Financial Council.
Hong Kong, although part of China, sets its monetary policy independently, that is, independently of the Chinese central bank.
In Hong Kong, interest rates are at the same level as in the United States.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said U.S. lawmakers should immediately restart talks and accept the financial system’s proposed bailout.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will also feel the consequences.
The Bloodbath of U.S. Stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to subsidize the financial system that would have cost $700 billion (almost 12 trillion kroner).
Legislators have thus ignored President George Bush’s call for support for the plan.
Bush said the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks went through a bloodbath and the leading stock indexes recorded the biggest fall in 20 years.
The Dow Jones had a nearly seven percent drop, the last time it experienced a similar fall was in 1987.
The index fell before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal was not adopted in the House of Representatives, the index began to fall free.
Congress: U.S. could pump $700 billion into banks
The top leaders of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of the agreement and financial assistance to the U.S. financial system.
This will be voted on early next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in negotiations to approve the rescue plan in the form of $700 billion (about 12 trillion kroner) in financial aid to the U.S. financial system.
But there is no victory yet.
Congress needs to finalize some of the details of the agreement before they can release the final form of the law and their vote.
The financial support plan will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Barney Frank, chairman of the Financial Services Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
Senate sources say the bill will likely be voted on Wednesday at the earliest.
According to economists, there should be an announcement that the rescue plan will be approved, which is the first important psychological factor in the revival of financial markets.
However, due to the complexity of the mechanisms, there will be a "cooling-off" afterwards.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have taken a big step.
We have resolved our differences of opinion on what the form of the market stabilisation package should be,” said Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat.
The final vote could take place on Sunday.
Lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Saturday night to give the final form to the U.S. government fund.
This would have to buy up unsellable mortgages from financial companies, which would put financial companies at serious losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
“We are close to reaching a final agreement on a project that will work and that must be effective in the market at the same time.
The corrective action plan still needs to be continued, but I think we’re there,” Paulson said.
Signal to Asian Trading
The global financial crisis is having a major impact on stock markets, which are falling sharply.
Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid said lawmakers would seek a final settlement in Congress on Sunday.
This is to reassure investors before they start trading in Asian financial markets, where the time zone could be the first for Congress to influence Monday’s trade.
However, it is not clear when the two chambers of Congress will vote on the bill, nor whether the trial will be held at the last minute because of a problem.
Lawmakers hope the bill will be approved in the coming days.
However, the law is still going through a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system shall be divided into two parts.
As President George Bush requested, the first $350 billion should be available as soon as possible.
However, Congress could block the release of the remaining amount, which was set at an additional $100 billion and later at $350 billion, if it gets the feeling that the program is not fulfilling its function.
President Bush has made progress in the negotiations.
Although the President may veto this resolution, Congress may overrule its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program remained, which was to acquire material assets for the purchase of bad mortgage securities that lost their value, since hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay their mortgage loans.
“We’ve worked everything out.
The House should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate should be able to vote on Monday,” said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
U.S. President Bush is also pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
Bush spokeswoman Tony Fratto said the president was pleased with Saturday's progress and appreciated "bipartisan efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Restrictions on severance pay
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, said the legislators had agreed on responsibility for the financial program, protection of taxpayers from losses, termination of benefits, and timing of the funding plan.
The new law also restricts the so-called “busy” severance payments of directors participating in the program, and establishes a committee to oversee the fund.
The fund should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve worked very hard on this, and we’ve made great strides toward an agreement that will work and that will benefit all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also includes assistance for homeowners who have problems with repayment.
The government should negotiate new installments for the mortgages it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly installments of debtors and allowing them to keep their houses.
Marek: Spiritual Aid
David Marek, chief economist at Patria Finance, says the proposed plan is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement.
“This is because there is no way of knowing with what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be acquired.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government share losses,” Marek told iHNed.cz.
According to Marek, it is not so important whether the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of next week.
“It is more important that Congress decide this week whether to support the plan and give its blessing as soon as possible.
The spiritual significance of reaching an agreement that the plan will be approved is the most important thing at the moment," Marek said.
Duel on the edge: MP3 players vs. mobiles.
We will help you choose
While almost all mobile phones can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
It’s better to just buy a phone.
There are many reasons to buy an MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the needs of the future owner.
It’s probably hard to get a high-end expensive turntable at home to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc record.
On the one hand, such musical products do not appear on vinyl records, but from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this either.
However, if your shelves are full of art rock, jazz or blues vinyl records, then you probably dream of such a turntable.
This is similar to traveling, or compressed - simplified to MP3 music.
There are also price and quality categories.
For some, it may be unacceptable to give 8,000 kroner for a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan will probably find it difficult to accept a 20-kroner market earphone.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
There's a wide choice.
Battery life also matters
Some high-end music players can do much more than simply play music, but also do what most mobiles don’t even accidentally do.
No other device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions of calling and texting, you can play music and video, record both, have a better or worse camera, and even navigate.
And if you consider smartphones and communicators, you will also have a small computer in your pocket.
This is a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no television can take photos.
However, multi-functional mobiles also have their drawbacks.
The more functions you use on your mobile, the more the display sends you to the charger.
And music playback is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few mobile devices can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, usually much less.
In this regard, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
With cheap mobiles, you should be aware that they won’t play for you for more than a few hours.
If you’re also making phone calls here and there, get an extra charger for your workplace just in case – this also applies to more expensive devices.
You won’t have this problem with MP3 players, even the worst ones can last at least 9 hours of continuous operation on a single charge.
The following issue occurs when uploading music to mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB connector, and besides, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly to the memory card, but few card readers can cope without an adapter with the miniature memory cards used in mobile phones.
With a few exceptions (iPod), you don’t need any special software.
It is enough to charge the device from the computer with music via USB.
The majority of mobile phones and players create their own music library, sorted by artist, album, genre, or user rating.
Some devices only show a tree structure similar to Windows Explorer, and some know both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobiles know more
When choosing a specific device, first of all, ask about the battery life, memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output, and, of course, the convenience of operation.
If music is primarily your background and you only listen to it for a short time each day, for example on the tram, then any mobile phone that plays MP3 will suit you.
This is something that any mobile phone can do.
You don’t even have to pay special attention to what music formats your mobile or player can.
With MP3, they all cope, and the vast majority of the music that reaches you will be in just that format.
MP3 is one of the most popular formats, and the vast majority of devices can also handle music in WMA format.
AAC (the format used by Apple and your iPod) is less common.
Better mobiles also allow you to buy music online, for example.
It is enough to visit the respective pages of the provider (or other provider) through the mobile Internet and purchase the song or album.
This service in itself can be a powerful argument for purchasing a music mobile.
Unfortunately, service providers are limited to lousy and usually only annual radio hits.
The prices are not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (whether via GSM, the internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people keep their mobile devices with them at all times.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you’ll be scanning your phone in your pocket while the forgotten MP3 player is lying at home.
However, it also depends on whether you always carry your headphones or at least your hands-free devices.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker that almost all mobile, but only a few MP3 players have.
For many, the biggest advantage of music mobiles will probably be the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3000 kroner.
Between three and four thousand kroner you can get enough decent walkman.
However, for the most part, you are limited by the lack of output from conventional headsets.
The best and most technically equipped phones with traditional 3.5 mm hole earphones can cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the players, however, is that they are easy to use.
The simplest - by no means necessarily the cheapest players (see our selection) really everyone can cope with.
A minimal function, a handling similar to that of a conventional cassette player or gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of a crash in the form of an accidentally switched on mobile internet, and no risk of a huge bill for data transmission.
Which device to choose
The cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have slots for removable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
If you buy the right card, it can cost up to 2,000 kroner.
But be careful.
Basic types only support cards with a maximum capacity of up to 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones know what to do with up to 8 GB of memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and even want to buy a cheap MP3 player, choose Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or irivert.
Based on the capacity (up to 2 GB) you do not need to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you belong to more demanding students, choose more specialized mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungs).
These devices also have a separate MP3 control button, so the convenience of operation is closer to the MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson is the farthest away in the industry, with its Walkman series of mobile phones having the same user interface as the MP3 players sold separately.
MP3 players of the above-mentioned brands can offer the same service in the same price range up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider will arrive in the Czech Republic later this year.
Maybe.
The Czech mobile market is relatively developed and our service providers offer virtually the same services as their Western European partners.
Nevertheless, something is missing here for us – a virtual service provider that forces classic service providers to make substantial price reductions.
Maybe it won't be for much longer.
On the Mobil.cz website we have written many times that Czech service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which pointed out that the price of SMS in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in other EU countries.
Following the European Commission's latest move to regulate roaming charges, this may lead to a controversial situation - for some Czech mobile operators, text messages sent from abroad will be cheaper than those sent domestically.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple: there is no real competition.
This may sound counterintuitive, as we have three mobile networks and our penetration is well above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators are happy to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office, often agrees with this, as he has previously stated on several occasions that there is no room for a new service provider in the Czech Republic.
Perhaps it is true that the classic provider with its own network probably doesn’t have much of a chance anymore (however, it would probably have a hard time finding a frequency).
But there is another option - the virtual service provider.
It was the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market that led to a significant price drop, to which the classic service providers had to react.
In the meantime, even before big fish like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the market in Great Britain, voices like ours were heard.
However, it has been proven that such providers have their place and can be truly successful.
However, for example, we do not have to go too far.
In February of this year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual service provider Mobilking in Poland.
In less than six months, this service provider managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest service provider there.
Meanwhile, behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic.
Virtual service providers have the advantage of being able to focus on a much narrower target group.
In order to operate efficiently, you need far fewer customers than a traditional service provider.
It does not entail relatively high construction, mobile network operation and maintenance costs.
Virtual service providers in the world thus tend to appear as low-cost – offering cheap calls and sms, which, however, are often offset by fewer services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers text messages that are at least 50% cheaper than its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it’s a pretty good move to bet on a target group.
This service is specifically focused on men.
“Real men choose Mobilking — who they like, who they can trust,” says David Seibert, CEO of Mobil Entertainment Company, the virtual service provider.
It is difficult to say whether an idea similar to that in Poland can work in Hungary.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD>, Vodafone’s spokesman, doubts this: “The Czech market is relatively small for the segment approach on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, it is relatively satisfactory in terms of the supply of services."
In the Czech Republic, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be a virtual service provider in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
“We are talking about the successful expansion of this project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not seem to be promising.
Mobilking will be launched in other countries in our region," Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, a spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, said in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
This indirectly demonstrated that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not very sympathetic to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything in their power to avoid any potential competition.
The GTS Novera Group has not been hiding its interest in launching a virtual service provider for some time now, which wants to take another step towards making Telefonica O2 a true competitor in the field of corporate customers.
“We are very interested in providing not only fixed line but also mobile telecommunications services to our customers.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
Some of them have already made progress in the negotiations,” says Pavel Kaidl, spokesman for the group.
There may be better times ahead.
From unofficial information, it seems that we can be lucky with the first virtual service provider already by the end of the year.
His birth, however, is surrounded by an impenetrable wall of silence.
“At this point in time, we don’t think there is any place for a fully-fledged virtual service provider in the Czech market.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very special.
So far, we have not been approached by a single subject offering a complex and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>, from Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica 02, told Mobil.cz.
The special situation of the Czech market is also referred to by other operators.
Martina Kemrová, T-Mobile’s spokesperson, said: “We have not yet recorded a single viable and bilaterally beneficial business project on which to base further.”
And he added: “In the T-Mobile network by the end of the year, it is unlikely that any virtual service providers will show up.
We should have a concrete agreement on the table right now to be able to think in the short term."
Vodafone is turning its attention to meeting its own 3G licensing requirements.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> adds: "We are open to discussions with potential virtual service providers, particularly in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
This is what we consider to be the most profitable for our customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find partners to build shared networks for high-speed mobile internet.”
Responsible agencies - one on one with service providers
The procedure of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of a new operator would mean an increase in competition, a decrease in prices and, consequently, a decrease in their profits.
So why make it easier to enter such a competition?
When service providers have something important, they are able to cooperate, as evidenced by the tug-of-war around the birth of U:fon.
<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> was probably under the greatest pressure around the birth of T-Mobile’s U:fon.
The publicly available information on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> website attests to this.
But right now, U:fon is a good argument for why we should not allow the virtual service provider to enter.
Martina Kemrová added: "The competitive environment in the mobile market has recently been amplified by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of a new player to the market and its services would be highly demanding."
However, in view of this attitude of the mobile operators, the complete lack of interest of the Czech regulators is downright astonishing.
In the meantime, it is not just the attitude of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which, unfortunately, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries, has no right to interfere in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
Only the Competition Authority is entitled to do so.
But the office is characteristically related to the whole problem.
“The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile market would only be possible after the agreement between the mobile operator and the virtual operator on the leasing of the necessary infrastructure has been concluded.
So far, no such contracts have been concluded, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not of sufficient interest to traditional service providers," Kristián Chlapua from the External Relations Department of the Hungarian Competition Authority (GVH) said in reply to our question.
A statement like this from the representatives of the service providers would probably not surprise anyone.
However, from an office that should represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, ensure that no one can abuse their market position, this is more than strange.
Especially if Kristián Chalupa adds: "In countries where virtual service providers usually operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to a decrease in the price of mobile services."
However, it is probably not in the interests of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS to exert pressure on the market environment to function properly and to reduce prices.
In this case, it is truly shocking that the reaction of the three mobile operators reveals a quite touching harmony.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is almost self-evident.
As in the case of filling stations, the exact same petrol prices are probably only the result of chance and tough competition.
“The Office has not detected any signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this case, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the service providers has a leading position, i.e. they do not have a proportionately greater responsibility for their market activities.
The tools needed to open up the mobile market for virtual service providers are also likely to be lacking for the telecom regulator," Chalupa said.
The presentation of the market leadership is one of the many points of dispute.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
Of course, no Czech operator is in a leading position in such a market.
However, some legal experts offer a different approach - the creation of a virtual service provider always requires approval from the network operator.
And the mobile operator, relatively logically, has a monopoly on its own network.
So, in a certain segment, it is necessarily dominant.
But even if we did not accept this argument, it should be at least a warning to UOHS that three mobile operators are strikingly similar.
In the meantime, complaints from a range of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in the course of negotiations with all service providers.
Transferring responsibility to <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is a relatively common trick in telecommunications, with which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS takes its hands off the whole case.
We have seen this in some similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the recently adopted law on telecommunications, the extension of the powers of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> in the field of economic competition in telecommunications has not been implemented, although many experts hoped that the situation would improve.
Representatives of the UOHS should know this well, but they probably have different interests.
It works when no one is watching.
Meanwhile, the operation of some kind of pseudo-virtual service providers, many of which are already operating in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that publish their own mobile phone service price lists, which, however, are only partially public.
These are multi-level marketing companies.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only the selected ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts as a classic corporate client against the service provider, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a featured customer, you will then receive special offers (and other discounts).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such advance purchases.
"If there were cases that he talks about, it would be a breach of contract that we would deal with and that could lead to the termination of cooperation with that company," said Martina Kemrová in response to our question on this issue.
But it is unlikely that news of such activity has not reached the responsible people of the mobile operators.
In particular, the three companies mentioned above may have thousands of customers.
In the meantime, no service provider is defending itself against such a procedure.
These companies have not negligible profits from their activities and, unlike real virtual service providers, they are not particularly threatened with their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> warns of potential problems: "The law allows for similar speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone is not in their name, so they cannot have it in its entirety as the general customers of mobile operators."
But that's exactly what <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> should be saying.
In addition, there is another question that arises for the UOHS.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to a similar procedure, why are they blocking the birth of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the UOHS has a relatively strong authority to expose such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the service providers that they did not suspect anything of this kind and that their commercial conditions prohibit this.
When We're Not the Most Expensive
As has already been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market has led to a noticeable decrease in the price of services.
Meanwhile, in virtually all the countries where virtual service providers were established, the classic service providers tried to prevent their establishment to a greater or lesser extent.
The arguments they used were practically the same - too small, perhaps too satisfied with the market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, in the developed countries, it was precisely at these moments that regulators intervened, in no way protecting the interests of mobile operators, but their customers.
Then, either through formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved the creation of the first virtual service provider, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are passing the whole thing on to each other.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that unclear competences are useful for them in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider is really coming soon, the Czech mobile market may be in motion again.
If a service provider were to allow the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it would be difficult for the UOHS to remain indifferent to the refusal (discrimination) of additional interested parties.
And compared to the rest of Europe, perhaps we won’t be making more expensive calls.
There are four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
Choose the best
Listen to four renditions of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the state anthem Where Is My Country? on the Day of Czech Statehood.
The anthem was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek.
There are four versions available - male or female solo, with choir or instrumental.
Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nková and Adam Plachetka sing.
The authors of the amendment of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiá<0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
You can listen to all four versions on the iHNed.cz website.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful anthems.
He told Czech Radio earlier that he had deliberately selected young singers with a representative voice, who are expressive and popular, to sing the solo variations in half.
"From the very beginning, I tried to make sure that both of them, and later the band, had clear diction, clarity of the lyrics and consistency," he said.
The Czech national anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where Is My Homeland? was first performed in the Rendi Theatre in 1834 in Josef Kajetán’s Tyl Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka, accompanied by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup’s music.
It became popular, and people spontaneously considered it their own.
The first verse of the song became a natural part of the national anthem after the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
After the establishment of the independent Czech Republic, it remained one of the seven state symbols.
What is the “new” anthem?
Prague transport company delivers chip card for the first time on Wednesday
October 1, 2008 Wednesday marks the date in the history of the Prague Transport Company when the first passenger will board metros, trams and buses, who will have an electronic coupon in his pocket instead of a paper ticket.
The coupon is currently available to approximately 100,000 people who own an Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day, 90-day and annual voucher (valid from 1 January 2009) and save it to their smartcard at the information centres and branches of the Transport Company at the Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Roztyly, Let<0xC5><0x88>any, Kobylisy, Kabyle<0xC4><0x8D>e, Rajská zahrada
The coupons can be purchased via the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz as of yesterday.
The service was used by more than 400 customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who start using the internet can finally forget about the publishing windows of metro stations, where they have had to stand regularly long lines for line tickets.
The coupon can be purchased over the Internet and saved on the Opencard card in one of the thirteen branches of the City Library.
“At these locations, passengers have access to a desk with trained servers to assist those interested in online shopping and to save their purchased coupons on their cards,” said Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>, project spokesman.
In addition to libraries, electronic coupons can be saved to Opencard in the self-service vending machines installed in some foyers.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket offices and passengers may have already noticed them at Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but it should be 80 by the end of the year," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> added.
The coupon is checked by an automatic instead of the driver
The machines that start working tomorrow are easy to operate.
Simply insert the Opencard chip card and the previously paid coupon will be saved on its own.
From tomorrow, electronic coupons will be valid not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
So, on the trains and bus lines around the city from 300 to 499, by which mainly residents of the central Czech districts travel to the capital.
“On the trains in Prague’s integrated transport system, the conductors were provided with card readers to determine the zone validity of the coupons,” explains Filip Drápal about the control of the line tickets from the Ropid organization, which compiles the schedule of public transport in Prague.
In buses around the city, card readers are installed at the driver's checkout.
Therefore, when boarding, the driver must not only be shown the chip card, but also the Opencard must be placed in a place specified on the checkout page.
The driver checks the validity of the vouchers.
"For example, if the passenger needs to check the validity of coupons, it is easiest to ask the driver to do so," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not travel by city buses and do not remember when their voucher expires will be able to return to the self-service vending machines that save coupons on cards.

The Sudeten people wanted a referendum on the United States.
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans asked for the annexation of <0xC5><0xA0>umava to the United States.
This is revealed by the letter that is in the collection of the South Bohemian Science Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
It is said that in 1945 some groups of Sudeten Germans turned to the President of the United States with this wish.
This is also revealed by a letter from a private archive, which is now kept in the collection of the South Bohemian Science Library.
In the letter, the Germans of <0xC4><0x8C>esky Krumlov asked the US President not to allow the re-delivery of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava County to the Czech Republic, which had been occupied by Hitler under the Munich Treaty.
“The situation has been correctly interpreted and we really want to be sure in the words that the American troops are not coming into German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter reads, “People who care about the fate of <0xC5><0xA0>umava.”
Since the annexation of Czechoslovakia to the Sudeten Germans, in addition to the knowledge of the Czech national character, can only give hope to brutality, ruthlessness, lack of understanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over the protectorate of <0xC5><0xA0>umava "now and forever".
“We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of four million inhabitants, this territory is considered a foreign country to us, which oppresses and ravages the minority and contributes almost nothing to the victory of the Allies,” the letter said.
The reason why the authors were not allowed to sign is allegedly the fear of revenge from the "Czech oppressors".
So, if the president of the United States were supposed to doubt the opinion of the Germans of <0xC5><0xA0>umava, it would be enough to hold a referendum in <0xC5><0xA0>umava County on whether its inhabitants wish to become part of the United States and live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem a bit na<0xC3><0xAF>ve given the current knowledge of post-war history, according to some historians, it adequately reflects the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Even if the Czech Germans had minimally suspected that they would be deported from the country, only a few of them recognized the possibility of doing so.
Some expected that the United States and Great Britain would agree on a kind of autonomy for the Sudeten people.
Still others were hoping to simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalupa, an Austrian journalist born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
Chalupa served as a Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice German in the Baltic Sea during the war.
When, at the end of the war, he was captured by the British and thrown into the Hol<0xC5><0xA1>tynsk prison camp, dozens of other Czech Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They hoped that when they returned home, they would benefit from the Czech language," Chalupa said.
According to him, none of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war expected to be deported on the basis of the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> decrees.
You don't think - you pay!
The emotional campaign attacks leaders
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
This could be the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek from this campaign hopes to deter leaders from dangerous behaviour behind the government.
The $150 million campaign will be broadcast on television, radio, cinema, the Internet and on flyers.
Drivers should be alerted to speeding and alcohol.
And you should also remind them to fasten their seatbelts before they leave.
It addresses the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what does it look like in the advertisements?
Stories that attack emotions, primarily human stories.
This is evidenced by the whole campaign's "bloody" slogan:
You don't think - you pay!
The phrase "do not think" is written in large letters on the license plate.
And the blood pool has the word "you'll pay" in it.
This should signify that one can pay for a moment’s inattention with one’s life.
Advertisements will continue to scare viewers until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where drastic images of accident victims can be seen on a regular basis.
It is hoped that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The advertising spots were created by the Euro RSCG agency.
Pull it, give it to the drivers
"Drivers are subject to the 'pull, let go' system.
For them, 'let it go' is when they run a red light, for example, saving them time.
'Pull' is the risk of punishment or accident.
The driver should be reminded of the risk,” says Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án, a traffic psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that’s why we need an information campaign in the press, especially a negative campaign, says the psychologist.
According to him, the signs that alert the driver to danger are less effective.
"If the hazard warning board is installed, it will probably quickly merge with the environment and the drivers will not deal with it," Ko<0xC5><0x99>án warned.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace.
Ehud Olmer, the president of the interim Israeli government, talked about the return of virtually all of the territories occupied in 1967, i.e. the West Bank of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He said this in an interview published Monday by Jediot Achronot.
“We have to make a deal with the Palestinians, which means we have to give back almost all, if not all, of the territory,” Olmert told the newspaper.
“We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage of Israeli territory, because without it there will be no peace,” he added.
He acknowledged that any return would include East Jerusalem.
“Anyone who wants safety in Jerusalem, and who primarily wants tractors and bulldozers not to pass through his feet, as happened with one of my best friends, must give up part of Jerusalem,” Olmert said, referring to the July attack on two cities in which some people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find “special solutions to the Temple Mount, sacred and historical places” in the Old Town.
“If you want to preserve Israeli sovereignty over the entire city, you have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work,” he stressed.
Exit from the Golan Heights
Olmert also expressed his opinion on the Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an indispensable condition for a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
“I do not propose a peace deal with Syria based solely on the withdrawal from the Golan Heights,” he warned.
“The Syrians know what they have to give up in order to get Golan.
They must give up their current relationship with Iran; they must give up their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shiite movement); they must give up their regular support for Hamas (the Shiite movement), Al-Qaeda and Jihad (holy war) terrorism in Iraq,” he said.
Questions After an Accident: Are Flight Attendants Illegal on Buses?
The law does not recognize them, they are not allowed to walk on long-distance buses
In connection with the Student Agency’s tragic bus accident near Padua, Italy, the question arose whether the flight attendants and passengers could travel in the bus while on the move.
“If we were to strictly and formally comply with the law, the stewardess’s activities would conflict with the law on transportation activities,” said Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Department of Transportation.
Last week, the death of a 22-year-old flight attendant was probably caused by a truck driver crossing the bus route.
Unfortunately for the girl, at that moment she was sitting next to the driver, in the least safe place on the bus, although two more seats were reserved for her.
The bus may collide or brake suddenly at the moment when the flight attendant serves coffee or offers a newspaper.
Whether the bus has a parking space according to the registration certificate has a role.
If the bus is not homologated, passengers must be seated.
The Student Agency coaches do not have standing places, which was confirmed to Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz by Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, the director of the company.
“We tried to find a solution to this with the ministry, and initially passengers were not allowed to move.
However, this has been withdrawn and we have concluded that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey if they have their own seats,” he said.
The law doesn't recognize the flight attendant.
"There is no clear legal regulation of the role of the flight attendant - no legislation regulates this position.
However, the carrier is not prohibited by any law from providing the services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the concept of a driver’s guide; it does not define its rights and obligations,” Hanzelka said.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, Director of the Road Vehicle Operations Department at the Ministry of Transport, believes that the law adequately addresses the problem.
“It depends on whether there is a parking space on the bus’s registration certificate.
And that's it," he says.
Buses can be urban according to their differentiation, where there are standing places and the maximum speed is limited, and between cities with standing places and allowed higher speed, and long-distance without standing places and allowed maximum speed with seats with seat belts.
Like on a plane, says the expert
Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n, traffic safety expert at BESIP, sees no fundamental problem with the movement of cabin crew on board the bus.
"There is not much danger in the continuous progress, the situation can be compared to the service on the aircraft.
I'm not even sure when there's turbulence and the flight attendant can hit his head."
“But if the bus brakes suddenly, of course, its physical laws apply.
Just like in city buses or trams.
The safety of the flight attendants must be solved by the carrier with internal rules," he says, and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to discontinue the services
The Student Agency is the only bus and coach carrier offering flight attendant services.
It employs 200 flight attendants.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider their work to be risky.
“However, as soon as I get the impression that the job of flight attendants is risky, I will terminate it.
Coffee and newspapers are available to passengers upon boarding.
That would be a cost saving,” he says.
Alexej Litvin, director of Asiana, who operates a fraction of the flights compared to the Student Agency, justified the lack of flight attendants in his vehicles with safety interests.
"We don't have flight attendants, we've been against that from the start.
Sooner or later, this will end in some kind of fatal injury," he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz less than a year ago.
An Unbelievable Tragedy Has Occurred
A young flight attendant from Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who had been working for the company for two years, died on a scheduled flight to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably pulled out of the lane without using a turn signal and blocked the bus.
The bus driver made a sudden maneuver to get around, but the right front of the bus hit him.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura rejects the sale of two reserved places for the rest of the flight attendants.
"These places can't be booked on long-haul flights, they're blocked."
The company wants to sue the truck driver.
By indemnifying the girl’s family, the agency does not wait for the court’s judgment, but also expects financial compensation from the offender.
Law amendment?
In the distant future
Clarifying the movement of flight attendants on board the bus could mean the amendment of the law, on which a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year.
“The group has not achieved any concrete results.
The buses are not so much concerned with the point system as with the maximum permitted speed on the motorway and mobile use while driving,” says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the flight attendants to be anything that would fundamentally threaten the safety of passengers,” Hanzelka said, adding that the police and labour offices are responsible for monitoring the safety of buses.
D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf hopes depend on Frankfurt
The letter from WestLB's board of directors to the bank's staff is not short of words.
The merger of the D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf financial institution and the Frankfurt-based Deka-Bank could become "the central capital market organization of the savings bank financial group," the letter said.
WestLB would introduce a permanently profitable "competence block" into such a business.
Such a link could give a decisive boost to further mergers in the provincial banking sector.
This is the reading of a directorate trying to prove its ability to act in difficult times.
After all, the precarious WestLB bank is still under enormous pressure.
Not only from the EU Commission, but also from the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, which recently informed the North Rhine-Westphalia provincial government that the deadline for finding a lasting solution was tight.
However, for savings bank clients, the relationship between Deka-Bank and WestLB, which is famous for its investment funds, has been a topic for some time now - also from the Frankfurt side.
As early as the end of August, the head of Deka-Bank, Franz Waas, said that the merger between a bank on Mainzer Landstra<0xC3><0x9F>e and a regional bank such as Helaba or WestLB did not make sense.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka, consisting of representatives of the Landesbanken and the savings bank associations, instructed the Board of Directors to negotiate the joint business with WestLB.
This may involve the capital market business or certain parts of it.
However, financial circles claim that the negotiations have only just begun.
With its 3,000 employees, Deka-Bank, one of the most important employers in the Frankfurt financial sector, is not the first time that the name has come up in connection with the consolidation of the savings bank sector.
In 2003, it appeared for a moment that Deka-Bank was merging with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, nothing happened to this threefold alliance.
The plans were hardly made public, and the Hessian provincial government spoke out against Helaba's interest.
The other two banks did not find each other.
Instead, Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was transferred to Landesbank Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg in Stuttgart.
However, the idea of the relationship between the Deka-Bank and the Landesbanks came up again and again.
Most recently, however, G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Merl, Chairman of Helaba’s Board of Directors, spoke out against plans to merge with his bank.
Nevertheless, it is recognised that there is a need to bring the various banks in the public sector closer together.
BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg are expected to be the first to contact each other after the Bavarian Landtag elections.
For Helaba, this is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure for further mergers increases, he may gradually run out of potential partners.
In southern Germany, he could only be a junior business partner, even though he has survived the financial crisis much better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The merger with WestLB was excluded at the beginning of the year by Giroverband in Hessen-Th<0xC3><0xBC>ringen, which has an 85% business share in Helaba.
In the absence of better, NordLB will remain.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the coin.
On the other hand, the question arises as to how the different business models of each bank fit together.
Merl stated in June that the German Savings and Loan Association had not yet answered the crucial question of what business model should be used to secure the future of the Landesbanks.
Finally, it is conceivable that WestLB would be split up, which is obviously not what is required there.
So the letter from the board there also says that they are definitely looking for a “complete solution”.
How this can be reconciled with the unification of the individual units with Deka-Bank is still the music of the future.
The second weekend of the Oktoberfest is known as the "Italian weekend"
This is the first time for Elena and the third or fourth time for Luca.
Now, however, Elena is here as his girlfriend, and so everything is quite different, says Luca.
Behind them, next to the Kaiser brand five-liter barrel, stands a strong-bodied bearded man, proving to some 200 people travelling to Oktoberfest how deep sounds he can pull out of his throat.
Elena first licks Luca's face, then kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova railway station, four buses depart at 23.45 to the destination "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", arrival is expected at 6.30.
Three buses are reserved mainly for Italians, while the fourth is reserved exclusively for Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, South Americans were already singing along with their flag, and they began to celebrate during the night.
And so loudly that it is not for the Italians, says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, who wears a long faux fur jacket and wide silver-rimmed glasses.
He has been travelling to Oktoberfest for five years, but this year he has organized three trips.
Overnight there, during the day at Oktoberfest, home at 10.30 p.m.
The accommodation would only be an unnecessary expense, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, which includes a welcome beer brewed in accordance with the Bavarian Beer Purity Act, accident insurance and a guided tour in German - Marco took a German language course in Frankfurt.
And now the buses are throwing themselves into the night on the highway in the direction of "Brennero".
No beer, not yet.
The bus is quiet and the passengers are asleep.
All right, they're gonna need their strength.
There are also stops in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where a number of Italian buses also take a short break on the 8 motorway before Munich.
When Marco’s group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at 6:30 p.m. as planned, there are nearly 50 other buses that have arrived from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds one last briefing, explaining the battle plan.
First, everyone put on the yellow hat.
On the left side is the inscription "Oktoberfest" in fractal letters, and next to it is the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, “When the gates of the beer tent open, run,” Marco yells into the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not forward, or we'll get stuck, and don't let all the yellow hats sit on the same benches, but let us spread out in the tent."
The one-liter jar costs €8.25, Marco yells.
And don't forget the tip.
"Show the security guards that you've behaved well.
As soon as you leave your seats, they will be occupied.”
Third, "Be back here at 10:30 sharp tonight." Do you understand?
And now we're going to Wiesn.
Along the way, one of the men ties yellow hats to the trees, signs, and even to the election poster of one of the major Bavarian people’s parties.
You have to be prepared to retreat.
This is the second weekend of the Oktoberfest, known as the "Italian weekend".
There are no exact figures; they are talking about 50,000 people crossing the Alps bursting into beer tents, with 10 percent of all visitors this weekend reportedly coming from Italy.
The Munich police force is reinforced by seven South Tyrolean police officers, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross, whose national statistics show that with around 200 medical services, Italians occupy the first place, ahead of the Austrians (around 80) and the British at the bottom of the podium (around 60).
The Hofbräu beer tent is especially popular among Italians.
Sleepless Nights for Hypo Real Estate Creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, federal finance minister Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck said just last week.
It is fortunate that the politician used the word “relatively” and even weaved into his message that the German banking sector is not spared by crisis-like developments.
Because it happened this weekend.
Daxon-listed Munich-based real estate company Hypo Real Estate (HRE) has received a multi-billion dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
A source familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan subsidies amounted to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the part used.
The money comes partly from private banks and partly from public banks.
In the background are the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to a newspaper report, Depfa, a state-funded company, lent money for long-term projects and refinanced itself for them on an extremely short term - which is no longer possible because of the distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserves decreased by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and its equity ratio also declined moderately, from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net cash income decreased to zero compared to the same period last year, and income from receivables and certain securities and the liquidation of credit provisions declined by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher revenues from the reimbursement of the ex-post settlement costs of the conversion of the former Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest according to the Decree on duties and the business brought to the companies belonging to the group, the income deficit of around 16% was relatively moderate.
The former state financier, after its privatisation in 1990, first speculated on corporate real estate loans, which were later segregated in Aeral Bank.
Due to the lack of classical public funding, Depfa has become more involved in infrastructure projects and private-public-partnership (PPP) projects with private investors and the state, and has expanded its activities internationally.
For the value of the subsidiaries, Hypo Real Estate must now make descriptions that have a "significant impact" on the group's profit and loss statement, they said fairly generally.
In fact, no dividend was paid.
Dividends were reduced to a third by 2007.
Since taking over Depfa, Hypo Real Estate has become a major state and infrastructure financier.
Compared to other financial institutions, it is more dependent on interbank market refinancing, since it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending between banks has stalled as banks guard their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term assets every year to refinance part of Depfa’s loan portfolio – some €50 billion.
According to a statement from Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financing needs are covered for the foreseeable future and the company is protected from “the influence of the currently largely dysfunctional international financial markets.”
According to other sources, thanks to the money, the refinancing is ensured until the end of 2009.
On the other hand, Georg Funke, Chairman of the Board of Directors of HRE, stated that the Hypo Real Estate group does not have to use the financial markets for a foreseeable period of time.
The Federal Bank of Germany and the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority (BaFin) believe that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate group is now assured.
This gives hope to the bank’s shareholders and creditors.
But because of the dynamics and immensity of the crisis, they cannot be sure.
It is not even inconceivable that funding should not be fully used.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out.
According to the late-night news on Saturday, the bank was still on the verge of bankruptcy, but even its temporary rescue could not calm the mood.
The share price fell by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
In contrast, bond prices hold up fairly well.
While the first-ranking debt has barely changed, the price of subordinated bonds has fallen significantly.
The crisis particularly affected the bonds of the former subsidiary W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg Hypo and, understandably, the maturities beyond 2009.
While Hypo Real Estate bonds used to seem like a speculative investment alternative, their value stability must now be seen as dependent on the stability of the international financial system in the wake of the escalating banking crisis and the fact that the financial institution took over Depfa and brought the crisis almost to the house.
As long as central banks, governments and less vulnerable business banks are still ready to support the system, it is possible to start by repaying the annuities on time.
Or it will be something that almost no one dares to hope for at the moment, that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, the reports of partial nationalisation have reduced the probability of certainty to a justifiable hope.
For long-term lenders, sleepless nights can be caused by the decision to divest from their investment.
However, short-term investors can use the sale as a reserve for taxes on exchange gains in the years to come.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to make her debut at Tachibana High School on her first day of school, the girls begin to giggle: The German chick is totally "kavai"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from manga - in the new exchange student blog she tells about Japan.
First day of school in Japan.
I was so excited.
On my way to school, I was already inflamed.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo, towards Kawasaki, and I take a 40-minute train ride to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my way alone, fortunately I was not lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not taken as seriously as at home in Lower Saxony.
Students begin to squeak in from eight o'clock, until at 8:40 a.m. a short conversation with the teacher begins, the "home room".
But before I started teaching, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I’m not the type of person who likes to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn’t have my school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt of my hostess, a blouse, blue knee-socks and black leather shoes.
So, in this dress, I stood in front of your cathedral and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sajonara, vo se Sylvana ..." - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany, and it's my birthday in a week.
At that moment I was very happy that I had started to learn the language already two years ago.
All 31 girls whispered, giggled, and waved, and I kept hearing the word "kawai."
I know that from my manga.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "cute, sweet."
Then I quickly swooped into my seat.
The girl sitting next to me smiled broadly, feeling honored that the exchange student had been placed next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite calm, but when the bell rang, they ran.
Everyone was talking and laughing, and with their questions they drilled a hole in my belly - although it is quite difficult to understand the English of the Japanese.
During the break, everyone unpacked their bags.
My host made me one of these lunches - it's completely different from the boring German snack sandwiches.
I got spicy rice, small sausages, a salad made of cucumber and algae, fruit and a kind of meat rolled into tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat here in Japan.
The food looks strange and has a completely new taste.
In fact, everything is very tasty.
Well, except maybe the salted plums, brrrr!
In Japanese schools, bento is not just for lunch.
It happens that a girl gives a boy a self-made bento, which she puts together especially artistically - in the hope of getting to know the boy more closely during the lunch break.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can see that here.
“Why Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always replied:
"Because you just fascinate me."
I’ve been reading manga for years.
And in order to better understand the comics and the culture described in them, I started to learn Japanese at some point.
It was clear to me that I would have to go there sometime.
Because I'm attracted to tradition and customs.
These are highly valued here.
Japan, on the one hand, is a country of the latest techniques and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I’ve never felt so lost, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Rats have emotions, too.
A rat or a moth escapes in case of danger. Does this mean that you feel fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux believes that animals have emotions.
But how can we test whether they feel the same when they act like us?
For years, famous scientists have published their articles in the Internet magazine "Edge".
SPIEGEL ONLINE looks at the answers to the question "What do you think is real without being able to prove it?" in one of its series.
I believe that animals have emotions and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it, but it's true that we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
In this case, however, we can at least hope that the basic configuration of all human brains is the same.
However, as we look at other species and explore issues of perception, or consciousness in general, we arrive at difficult terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: pretend to be dead, run or attack.
Humans behave in a similar way, from which some researchers infer comparable subjective experiences.
But I don't believe that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experiences to animals.
Circuits related to human consciousness, on the one hand, almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its role in short-term memory and executive/control functions).
This vast area is more highly developed in man than in other primates, and appears to be completely absent in other organisms.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, such as knowing who we are or the ability to plan and make decisions, it is reasonable to assume that humans are even different from other primates.
Another dramatic feature lies in the linguistic nature of man: Since a significant part of human experience is connected with language, it is often claimed that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
But even if consciousness were not dependent on language, it would certainly be influenced by language, so that animal consciousness, whatever its nature, is probably very different from most of our states of consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to determine what consciousness might be like in the case of other animals.
If consciousness cannot be measured as an internal and subjective thing, and cannot be analysed on the basis of our own experiences because of the special hardware, then its research presents us with serious problems.
Most of my discussions are about the content of conscious living, but there is another aspect of consciousness that is probably more accessible to science.
The consciousness processes of animals could be examined regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in experiments on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
However, this assumption, which was also investigated by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, relies more on the neural connections of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: Both may or may not be the same.
Interestingly, this hypothesis also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex in the formation of visualization.
What does this mean for emotions?
This is because an emotional system, like that of fear, is activated in a brain that is aware of its own actions.
What we call “fear” is therefore the mental state in which we are when the activity of the defense system localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as bodily reactions) occupies a working memory.
In this way, emotions are closely linked to areas of the cerebral cortex that are characteristic of primates and especially humans.
In addition to the linguistic nature, perception is subdivided into subtle stages, because with the help of words and grammar, we are able to distinguish and categorize states in order to describe them not only to ourselves, but also to others.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, is of the opinion that emotions are derived from simpler activities of the cortex and body-sensing areas of the brain stem, as is Jaak Pankseep, who, however, prefers to focus on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it can easily play a role in cross-species emotions.
In theory, I can't deny it, but I think it's unprovable.
Pankseep believes that what appears to be fear in rats and humans is likely to be fear in both cases: How can we control whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave in the same way?
When a cockroach escapes danger, does he feel fear?
In my opinion, just the same behavior is not proof of the same experience.
Although neural comparison helps, rats and humans have similar brains, but cockroaches have no brains.
But is the brain stem responsible for emotions?
And even if it could be proven in humans, how could we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, but maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have emotions.
However, I do not know how to prove this.
And because their emotions are suspected to be fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to study the emotional behavior of rats rather than their emotional emotions.
In any case, progress in this area is promising at the neural level, if we measure the same in rats and humans.
Just as in the case of rats, I do not search for language and consciousness, nor do I search for emotions, for I do not know whether they exist.
For others, this may seem like a short-sighted approach, but I would rather move forward than keep hitting a wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: Time of Mercy for Poland and Ukraine
Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasyunik said the preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
“The government sees in UEFA’s decision in Bordeaux the confidence in Ukraine and its belief in Ukraine’s ability to organise the European Championship together with Poland,” Vasyunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much to be done in both countries."
In terms of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, both host countries are lagging behind.
It is possible that the number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We have to work at top speed,” said Grigory Surkis, president of the Ukrainian Football Federation.
“Uefa will keep an eye on us.”
In Poland, they decided to take an even more radical step.
Following several scandals, the National Olympic Committee suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN association, which was replaced by independent supervisory commissioner Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met on the initiative of Miroslaw Drzewiecki, Minister for Sport.
“There is a serious risk that PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules,” Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
“In a letter, we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that this will not adversely affect the preparations for the 2012 European Championship.”
Only in the last season several first league teams had to be placed in the lower division due to manipulation, and finally the league start had to be postponed.
Outraged Dennis Quaid Strikes Back
The actress wanted to promote a new film, in the interview she talked about her private life - and now she got into trouble with her ex-husband. Meg Ryan, a Hollywood star, called her former husband Dennis Quaide an adulteress.
The One Who Strikes Back – and Strikes Back
The Belated War of the Roses at Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid Ex-Husband: The two Hollywood actors fight a nasty battle seven years after their divorce - in public.
In an interview with InStyle magazine last week, Ryan said for the first time about the reasons for the divorce: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, causing me a lot of pain."
And it wasn't until after the divorce that she found out how many women Dennis had cheated on her with.
The spiritual striptease took place because of Ryan's new press work on his film "The Women", which tells the story of adultery.
Dennis Quaid reacted decisively to her call as an unfaithful husband: “It’s horrible,” the 54-year-old actor told the New York Daily News newspaper, “that Meg is bored and rehearsing the story of our relationship.”
In addition, it’s also “unfortunate” that 16-year-old common boy Jack is repeatedly “publicly reminded of the many pains and changes that divorce brings to a child.”
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and recently became the father of a pair of twins.
So his response ends with the following side cut: "My life continues anyway.
I’m happy to know that I have a wonderful family where everything is in order.”
Reduced airfares and hotel room prices
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a recent study, flights in Germany have become no less than 50 percent cheaper.
The prices of flights and hotel rooms have once again become more affordable, according to a study by American Express, a travel and financial services provider.
The company analysed the booking data for the first half of 2008, and after the price increase in the first quarter, it found a significant price drop in the second quarter.
After years of rising prices in the hotel market, accommodation has become cheaper in many places.
Between January and March, prices rose by an average of 6.9% in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed compared to 2007.
In the period from April to June, however, prices were already 3.6% lower than in the previous year.
This trend was most evident in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The reason for this is seen by American Express as the low exchange rate of the dollar, which has led to “the languishing desire of American tourists to travel.”
Lower hotel room prices affect financial centres such as Frankfurt or London more than industrial cities such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, the 26.3% increase in hotel prices is a European record.
There was also an increasing trend in the prices of air tickets in the first quarter.
The rise in the price of kerosene meant that passengers in economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and long-haul flights were 29.2% more expensive.
Between April and June, the prices of economy class flights decreased by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in business and first class, prices showed only a much more moderate change.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices rose by 11.9 percent and fell by 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
The cost of domestic flights in Germany has been cut by half, according to the study.
On the one hand, the reason for the price decline is the slowing economic growth, the company says.
Demand has weakened in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, the Open Skies agreement, which liberalised air travel between the US and Europe, is intensifying the competitive pressure.
The fact that airlines are cancelling their loss-making flights and that a number of airlines have declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - 24 in Europe alone - is proof of the tense situation.
HSV beats Gladbach 1-0
With one goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV came to the top of the table.
At Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to find a viable team.
Kristoffer Klein magnification Deep flying for the national team Marko Marin.
The player from Gladbach got into the game only late and his raise bounced off the goalpost.
His precise message left his lips convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," Hermann Rieger hissed in the corridor leading to the cabins at the Hamburg Arena.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break was over, and most of them were sitting in their seats again.
Rieger has been a physical therapist at HSV for nearly three decades and enjoys more prestige than some of the former players.
So your request was heard in the appropriate place.
Assistant Coach Cornelius Jol nodded and showed his thumbs up in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg manager Martin Jol.
His order was the same: Give me the second goal!
The order was not executed.
“It wasn’t always pretty today,” Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt had a "slower idea" of it.
The goal score of 1: 0 (1: 0) was attributed to the Hamburgers' leader Mladen Petric (11th); and the circumstance that the very weak Gladbachians could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol said.
Hamburger SV will be 121 years old on Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the table on the projector, which presented their team as the top of the league.
It's gonna be a no-party birthday.
"We know where to put it," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the league's intermediate score indicates the league's unpredictability rather than HSV's dominance.
Despite the team's late commitment to the song - Brazilian Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric and FC Bayern's acquisition of Jansen - the team is slowly recovering, but not yet brilliant.
"We need more sense and more trickery," Jol demanded.
After the vote
Wall Street is full of fear.
The first news of the failed rescue package caused the Dow Jones to temporarily drop 700 points.
That was the biggest loss of points in his history in a single day.
Later, the Dow was somewhat strengthened.
At 8:30 p.m., the world’s most important stock exchange barometer was down a good 5 percent and stood at 10,579 points.
The Nasdaq, which trades in technology papers, fell by more than seven percent to 1,548 points.
The biggest loser at the time was American Express with 14%, followed by Bank of America with 12%.
Not a single piece of paper was strengthened.
Goldman Sachs shares fell nearly 10 percent.
Just a few days earlier, a stake in the bank was bought by large investor Warren Buffett.
In the framework of the rescue operation, funds are planned to be made available for the purchase of so-called dubious mortgage securities.
However, the amount is not intended to be paid at once, but gradually.
In return, the state would receive stock option vouchers from financial institutions, which could be used if the exchange rates changed accordingly, reducing the burden on the state treasury.
European and American stock prices in slump
Billions in aid for European and American banks do not dispel investors’ doubts.
The share price of the German bank Hypo Real Estate is falling and is taking Dax by storm.
The U.S. Dow Jones index is declining despite a planned bailout of the financial market by the government.
The spectacular exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank pushed the German equity index (Dax) deep into the negative.
Despite a rescue operation by the federal government and private banks, the Munich real estate funder’s stock has fallen to a quarter of its value, with Commerzbank weakened by more than 20 percent.
The Dax sank below the psychologically important 6,000-point mark and scored 5,839 points with a minus of 3.7 percent.
Stock markets are on their knees around the world.
In New York, Wall Street opened with a significant loss.
Investors fear that the U.S. government’s $700 billion bailout package will not be enough to boost the financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points in the first hour of trading, down 3.3 percent to 10.809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives is expected to vote on the rescue plan, and the Senate vote will take place on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE indicator showed a decline of 3.2 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei index fell by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 points.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index fell 2.1 percent to 18.286.90 points.
India’s Sensex fell 506.43 points, or 3.9 percent, to 12.595.75 points.
On the Mdax stock exchange, Arcandor’s shares weakened after the announcement of the capital increase.
Sal. Oppenheimer private bank has subscribed to 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourism group also said that Thomas Cook shares would not be sold.
Dark Matter Affects the Flight of Space Probes
A mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among researchers for years. Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.
The Ulysses spacecraft has been in space for nearly 18 years.
Due to the imminent freezing of fuel lines, he is in danger of freezing to death.
For years, scientists have been confused by a mysterious phenomenon called the swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by refers to the gravitational swing maneuver of space probes, during which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as Earth.
Thus, the probes can save a large amount of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe, like the Ulysses solar probe, used this physical trick.
But what has amazed researchers for years is that flying objects don’t behave completely as one would expect under the ancient law of gravity.
Instead, there are anomalies in speed.
Unexpectedly, the probes speed up or slow down.
Physicists have yet to find an explanation for this effect.
This phenomenon is called swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which regards the gravitational pull of matter as the curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler, of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, continues to firmly believe that Einstein was right, and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly by the so-called dark matter discovered by astronauts in the universe.
"The anomaly may be caused by dark matter, which may even be found as far away as Earth," Adler writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space scientists for ten years.
Evidently, it exerts a force of gravity that exerts an effect on other celestial bodies.
However, the material itself is completely invisible, i.e. it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light.
Scientists estimate that a good fifth of the total mass of the universe is made up of dark matter.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt released
After spending ten days in captivity, the tourists deported to Egypt are free again, the Italian foreign minister confirmed.
Kidnappers in Sudan demanded a ransom of millions of euros.
The shooting, which preceded the release of the hostages, claimed the lives of six of the hostage-takers.
Five German nationals were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Talks on the ransom are already underway.
Over and over again, the Germans become the target of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE reports on the most important cases.
The European tourists who were deported to the Sahara are free.
This has been reported unanimously by Egyptian state television, Arabic television Al-Arabiya and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the fact of the release, according to Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been freed.
We are now looking at their health,” Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as eight Egyptian escorts, are safe and sound, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are said to be on their way to Cairo.
The reasons for the shooting before the hostages were released remain unclear: According to an Egyptian security official, the hostage-takers had already shown willingness to release the hostages when the Sudanese army unexpectedly killed six of them.
"The problem is solved.
They accepted the ransom,” the official said.
"The trial was all about taking hostages," when suddenly there was a "surprise."
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers shot six kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and arrested two more.
The hostage-takers demanded a six-million-euro ransom from Germany, which would have been handed over to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "al-Masri al-Jom", citing a German mediator, reported that the release of the hostages is delayed because the kidnappers are concerned about their own safety.
According to the report, the hostage-takers release the female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men are held by the kidnappers until a safe escape route is found.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to comment on the report.
'Suicide' led to step-father violence
A woman committed suicide because her stepfather had abused her for years.
Michael Trerise, a 57-year-old from Stithians, Cornwall, has spent six years in prison after confessing to eight counts of attempted rape.
The criminal court in Truro learned that he had regularly tied up his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle between the ages of five and seven.
In one of Trerise's confessions, he wrote, "I feel responsible for his death."
Randle committed suicide at the age of 34 at his home in the Mutley district of Plymouth, England, on April 1, 2007.
While living in Coventry as a child, Trerise bound and blindfolded her before intercourse while her mother worked in a pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and chose Cornwall as his new home.
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court trial revealed that Ms. Randle, who had spent a lot of time volunteering for the National Trust, was haunted by the horrors of the twice-weekly violence.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Ms Randle, who had previously been passionate about surfing and cycling, had been described by her friends as “emotionally dead” and “renunciation of life.”
In April 2007, his father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his Plymouth apartment.
He probably strangled himself with a bag.
Mr. Randle clashed with his daughter's stepfather, who ended his testimony in a letter saying, "I always bound and blindfolded his eyes.
I didn't sexually harass her.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise, "You're an extremely strange fetishist, and I'm sure that was terrible for your victim, especially if he was only seven years old.
This unpleasant family story ended with the victim committing suicide.
Even more compelling is the fact that if he had not done so, the case might never have been brought to justice.”
The judge added: “I would like to draw attention to what Stephanie’s parents have said about the impact your crime has had on their daughter over the years.
If that hadn’t happened, she would have probably been a hopeful, successful and happy young woman.”
Official Charged for Losing Important Data
The BBC said it had accused a government official of violating official secrecy after he left top secret documents on a train in June.
The man was on an expert mission from the Department of Defense when he left two top secret documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were sent to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the mildest charge of breaking the law, and there is no suspicion of intentional misconduct.
Frank Gardner, a correspondent for the BBC’s Ministry of Defence, said the move surprised many at Whitehall.
“They believed that the Ministry of Defence and the government would treat the case as an internal matter,” he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, has been charged on the basis of section 8.1 of the Act. This paragraph is about the preservation of information.
The State Attorney’s Office suggested that the Metropolitan Police represent the official because of his rather sensitive work with the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he lost included secret assessments of al-Qaeda and the Iraqi army’s capabilities.
He was notified of the decision on Monday and moved to an unknown location.
Housing cooperatives pay for B&amp;B account
Home-building cooperatives in Britain can expect an account of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The government has spent <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect 2.6 million of Bradford & Bingley’s deposits.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that use the money of depositors, including 59 housing cooperatives.
Adrian Coles, president of the Association of Housing Cooperatives (BSA), said it was “annoying” for companies and their members to have to pay.
The <0xC2><0xA3>14bn loan will eventually be repaid after the Bradford & Bingley mortgages are repaid.
However, the interest accrued in the meantime is passed on annually to the 700 financial companies that use the loans.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC that 59 housing cooperatives are among them.
It is annoying that institutions that have been acting prudently ... now have to pay the bills of institutions that have been much less careful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We learned that each company has to pay the amount of the deposit that it has in its possession. The companies share 18% of the costs among themselves.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the loan will reach <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to set aside <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay interest for the first year.
Adrian Coles, the director-general of the housing company union, told the BBC that he considered the measure unfair.
“It is outrageous that institutions that acted prudently during the boom in the housing market should have to pay the bills of much less cautious institutions.”
According to the BSA, no company has gone bankrupt since they began operations in 1945.
“We need to look at all aspects of this case in the next few weeks to decide how to protect housing companies and their members from a significant bill,” Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers 7 months from the end of September to the end of March of this year.
In 2010, a full year’s interest will be paid, which may be as much as twice as much as the current one.
Because housing cooperatives are self-help organizations without shareholders, eventually the members will have to pay the bill, either through higher fees or through lower interest on their deposits.
The price of milk rises by five pence per litre
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey dairy company has announced a five-pence increase in the wholesale price of milk per litre from Monday.
This is the second price increase this year since the two-pence increase in February and after a survey conducted by a consulting company.
Retailers themselves decide whether to pass on the price increase to consumers.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk changed for the last time in 2002.
Ex-Bangladesh MP refused request to defend himself at liberty
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a request from a former member of parliament, Sheikh Hasina, to defend himself at large, meaning he could be arrested when he returns to the country.
His lawyer said the court had denied him immunity in connection with the charge of extorting $50 million ($729,700) from a businessman during his time in parliament.
This case is just one of many corruption allegations against him.
Sheikh Hasina's former political opponent Khaleda Zia was released on bail this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but his party, the Awami League, demands that the country’s military-backed provisional government give him full freedom first.
According to reports, although he was released conditionally so that he could go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear from the terms of his release whether he can maintain his freedom when he returns to the country.
His lawyers say he will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Court of Appeal.
“The appeal court rejected Sheikh Hasina’s bail application as unnecessary, as he is now on temporary leave and is undergoing treatment abroad,” we learned from lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal the decision of the Court of Appeal."
According to his lawyers, he needs to defend his freedom in order to be able to return to the country and prepare for the December elections.
A leader of the Awami League party said on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17.
He was arrested last year after the army-backed provisional government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny any charges against them.
Concerns about the polio vaccination programme in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, almost 200,000 Afghan children have been left out of the recently organised polio vaccination programme due to Taliban-related violence.
Last week, the United Nations launched a vaccination campaign in six provinces.
However, they said they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said this happened despite the Taliban’s promise not to attack or obstruct the work of the thousands of staff who carried out the vaccinations.
BSkyB's appeal over ITV rejected
BskyB’s appeal against the decision of the Competition Commission, which ordered it to reduce its interest in rival TV station ITV, was rejected.
The Competition Court of Appeal ordered BSkyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
In the past, the Commission found that BSkyB’s shareholding impedes competition and gives the company unfair influence over ITV.
BSkyB bought its stake in 2006 and effectively prevented NTL, which has since been renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the GVH reported that the stake acquired by BSkyB in ITV threatened ITV’s independence, prompting the Competition Committee to open an investigation.
Virgin’s director, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups, and Ofcom oversight were all opposed to the acquisition.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its stake in ITV was a pointless and disproportionate reparation, in particular given that BSkyB had stated that it would be willing to give up its voting rights.
A new investigation into the U.S. Attorney's case
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The move followed a report by the Chief Justice of the Justice Department criticizing the decisions of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers, and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was ordered because of fears that prosecutors had been dismissed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials interviewed during the investigation have attempted to obstruct justice by lying.
"Serious allegations of a possible crime have not yet been investigated or clarified," said Detective Superintendent Glenn Fine.
One of his main proposals was to appoint a special prosecutor with the power to order witnesses to testify.
In December 2006, the U.S. Department of Justice removed nine U.S. attorneys from office.
At the time, it was said that the state prosecutors were dismissed because of their poor performance.
However, it was later revealed that the dismissed public prosecutors received no worse ratings than many of their colleagues, leading many to conclude that the dismissals were politically motivated.
Some state prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican members of Congress, while others refused to participate in the investigation of allegations of election fraud against Democrats.
U.S. Attorneys are conducting investigations and court cases on behalf of the government.
They can be dismissed at any time, but they cannot be removed from their positions for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Alberto Gonzales, became the target of the main state prosecutor's attacks due to the dismissals, and eventually resigned.
Several other Justice Department officials also resigned.
In his report, the superintendent strongly criticized Gonzales’ role in the case, saying that the Attorney General was “primarily responsible” for the dismissals, his “resigned” leadership role, and had “remarkably withdrawn” from the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, a former aide to Bush Sr., have been criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf receives recognition
Rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem, Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive his special gold award at the London ceremony next week, said he was honoured by the award.
The nine-minute, fifty-five-second song was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
Coldplay received the most nominations for this year’s awards, with nominations in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: “There are a few songs that cross the boundaries of time or genres, and ‘Bat Out Of Hell’ is like that.”
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a very large voice, and that voice was Meat Loaf's.
The song began with a nearly two-minute instrumental section.
It was released as a single in 1979 and peaked at number 15 on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" remained on the charts for almost nine years and sold more than 40 million copies.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has been struggling with health issues lately. Among other things, he underwent surgery in 2003 after collapsing on stage due to a heart rhythm disorder.
In 2007 he had to cancel a few concerts due to acute laryngitis.
It was later discovered that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Unknown big-city street that is often forgotten and may soon be sold
New York City has thousands of boulevards, boulevards and other side roads. Some of them are famous, others have a purely practical function.
However, many experienced taxi drivers and long-time residents would find it hard to tell where the Extra Place is, mostly because they’ve never heard of it.
The small street is in the East Village and runs north from First Street — without reaching Second Street — between Bowery and Second Avenue.
It is about 9 m wide and 36 m long, and resembles a dusty alley rather than a main transport route.
No street signs.
It can not be found on a standard map.
However, the street has its admirers.
There is, for example, Avalon Bay, the builder of the recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
He wants to resurrect the Extra Place and ensure that the shops and boutiques of the new buildings can be reached by a cleaner road.
Admirers of the street include long-time residents of the neighborhood, who were struck by the truncated street that was the only remnant of the area’s past before renovations.
However, it is not in the interest of the street owner, the city’s building conservation and development department, to stick to it.
This month, at a meeting of the district council’s land management committee, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay submitted a proposal that the builder would buy the street.
However, the committee would prefer the street to remain in the city’s administration, and has asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, district head of the 3rd municipal body.
“There are very few areas that the city already owns, and we want the Extra Place to remain the city’s,” he said.
“We can come up with suggestions for renovating and managing it that you can do on Avalon, but we also want to ensure it remains accessible to the public.”
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that it wanted to redo the small street and provide seating. Some of these would be used by a cafe, which the builder is expected to rent out an area.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was first made public at this month’s meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it does not insist on owning it.
“Avalon Bay’s top priority is to renovate this rundown alley and turn it into a pleasant public place,” he said, adding that the city had proposed to buy it.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Building Conservation Bureau, said the city really wanted to sell the street and noted that the office’s job was to develop the buildings, not manage them.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, the Bowery, the Extra Place has little historical significance.
According to some, it was named "No Man's Land" in 1802, when the large estate of Philip Minthorne was divided among his countless children, and no one claimed the narrow strip of land.
The punk-rock monument that closed in 2006, the CBGB's back entrance to the Extra Place, and the street is perhaps most famous for the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"It was a great location," said Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, scraps of clothes, pieces of barrels and posters, and leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers, who write about how the middle class took possession of the East Village, oppose the sale of the Extra Place, arguing that this piece of public property, however modest, should remain in the possession of the community.
Others mention Extra Place as a rarity, which is a virtually unchanged piece of the city and should be left in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, author of the blog "The Disappearing New York of Jeremiah" ("The Book of Lamentations: A Bitter Nostalgia for the Process of the City's Extinction"), posted on his blog part of the story about Extra Place, which appeared in the weekly magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952 under the heading "City Rumours".
Author Brendan Gill wrote, “Extra Place is a narrow, small cul-de-sac that is dark even during the day, bordered by rusty iron storage doors and shuttered windows, and where weekly newspapers are carried by the wind in the sewers.”
The street, with a few exceptions, looked the same a few nights ago.
A rat ran through the end of the street, next to the back door that used to lead to the CBGB, and now it belongs to a higher-priced clothing store built in its place.
There was graffiti on the walls, and an empty, 0.75-liter beer bottle was lying next to a discarded pile of fresh newspaper.
Some passersby said they rarely think of Extra Place, but they think it could use some renovation.
Fields said some people underestimated the attraction of the street in its current state.
“I spent the best years of my life in dark, damp and disgusting places,” he said.
Discussion on bilingual education: Continuous exposure to the English language environment
In this section of the Education Monitor, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates’ views on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an experienced researcher in California Studies and senior director of educational research at the Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research, is the co-author of the book “Not As Good As You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choices.”
It is not easy to please voters from Spanish-speaking areas.
This includes Barack Obama’s proposals on education.
According to Obama’s campaign, “African-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” and this is true.
To overcome such performance differences, Obama’s education plan explicitly advocates, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for English learners.
At the same time, for Obama, the question is whether his commitment to bilingual education, with its emphasis on non-English language school education, outweighs his interest in overcoming the big performance gaps.
Take, for example, the Sixth Street Prep charter primary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
Most of the students in the school are Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are learning English.
Nevertheless, 100% of the fourth graders achieved an excellent result in the state mathematics exam in 2008.
Equally impressive is that 93% of fourth graders passed the English Language and Literature exam.
This incredible achievement was not achieved by the means that Obama would prefer.
Sixth Street places emphasis on repetition, practice, continuous assessment of skills, and rejection of excuses.
In addition, and this is what Obama should take into account, Sixth Street director Linda Mikels says, the school's educational principle is to "immerse" English-speaking students "fully" into the language environment.
The essence of the immersion method is the almost exclusive use of the English language in teaching other subjects.
Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said: “We have had an overwhelming success in seeing that if someone walked into a classroom, they wouldn’t notice who the student was who had just arrived from Mexico 12 months earlier.”
"It works," he said, "it works for us."
Would Obama set schools such as Sixth Street Prep as an example to be followed by other schools that teach a significant number of Spanish-speaking and English-speaking students?
The results of the school should make the answer clear, but because of the education policy of his own party (National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education), and because he himself consistently stands for bilingual education, we cannot be sure of Obama’s reaction.
While he agrees that immigrants should learn English, Obama recently downplayed the issue when he said people shouldn’t worry so much about the “exclusive English” of the legislation.
Instead, he said, "they should make their children speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to reduce the gap between results, he should seriously study the models that work, rather than look down on and ignore them.
The renewed concerns about the economy led to a sharp fall in oil prices
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday due to concerns that America’s rescue plan for the financial markets will not be able to revive the economy.
Crude oil stocks fell seven percent to $99.80 this morning on the New York Stock Exchange.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity exchanges have been rocked by the Wall Street financial turmoil and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices reached $145.29 per barrel in July, they fell to almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before falling again under the influence of the immense uncertainty of the financial markets.
On Monday, concerns again gripped investors, even after congressional leaders announced that they had reached an agreement over the weekend on an economic rescue operation, the largest in history.
The news has been overshadowed by concerns that the financial crisis will not end for a long time to come.
As the latest event in the unfolding crisis, Citigroup will acquire Wachovia Corporation’s banking business, the government announced on Monday.
In the meantime, the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said as a result of the desperate weekend talks, "it appears that the rescue operation has failed to revive the stock market's trading appetite."
As the economic situation worsens, it is expected that demand for commodities such as oil will also decline.
“The future of the equity, interest and foreign exchange markets around the world has become uncertain,” a Deutsche Bank analyst wrote to investors.
“We don’t think the ‘epidemic’ will be avoided in the commodities market either.
The biggest question from a commodity exchange perspective is to what extent the U.S. "disease" is infecting the entire world, especially China."
As the slowdown in economic growth led to a decline in oil consumption, bank analysts cut back on their expectations for next year, reducing their oil and gas price forecasts for 2009 by 20%.
With the success of the second quarter, the team set a record
After spending more time in the Jets uniform than anyone else for the past eight seasons, defenseman Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
But then he watched the second quarter unfold on Sunday when the Jets turned a pointless game into a sensational game.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals’ languid play became fully aligned with the dark clouds in the sky.
Brett Favre, quarterback, gave a 12-yard touchdown pass to Laveranues Coles, which was the perfect precursor to an afternoon in which their emerging collaboration had evolved significantly.
Favre gave Coles two more touchdown passes in this quarter, including when two cornerbacks fell 10 seconds in a row before the end of the half.
“I didn’t regret the effort,” Favre said of all the passes he gave Coles.
“He’s a hell of a player.
We’ve been able to communicate well with each other, no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing ball, the defense stopped Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis caught a bad throw and threw it back 32 yards, which was a touchdown.
Eric Smith, a safety player, reached into another pass and took the ball.
David Bowens, linebacker just manages to reach the ball first.
That last turn could have been the most amazing move of the match.
However, when the Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end and the Jets scored, Jay Feely scored a 20-yard field goal, setting the score at 34:0.
This was the best result the Jets have ever achieved in a quarter.
When asked by Jets coach Eric Mangini to describe the game's mind-boggling nature, he said, "Is it the second quarter or the third quarter?"
When told that both of them - in the third quarter, the Cardinals scored 21 points without the Jets scoring a single point - Mangini said, "I have to tell you, I enjoyed the second quarter a lot more than the third.
We scored a lot of points in a short period of time.”
The well-rested Gebrselassie breaks its own world record
Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why many consider him to be the best middle and long distance runner who ever lived, when he broke his own world record in Berlin on Sunday, making him the first to run the 42.2 km in 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win on the comfortably flat track at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved in Berlin last year.
By the age of 35, Gebrselassie had set the 26th world record in her career in such a variety of fields that she had won the world championship or world record in almost every race from the 1500 metres to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing that air pollution would exacerbate her asthmatic problems.
Instead, he entered the Berlin Marathon.
In almost perfect conditions – sunny weather, initially at 9 <0xC2><0xB0>C and finally at 13 <0xC2><0xB0>C – Gebrselassie won on Sunday at an incredible speed of 2 minutes and 56 seconds per kilometre.
Since runners such as Gebrselassie and Kenyan Paul Tergat, who had never run a marathon before, have turned to longer distances, the marathon record has fallen by more than two minutes in the past decade, since Brazil’s Ronaldo da Costa won in 1998 with a 2:06:05 finish in Berlin.
After Sunday’s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had a cramp in his legs and was unable to work out for two weeks.
It is obvious that during the forced rest he was refreshed and not rusty.
"I'm so glad," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I started training again a week ago, and today I had doubts, but in the end everything went well.”
He has received some criticism, particularly from Kenya, Ethiopia's rival in East Africa, for using too many assistive devices in his races, generally avoiding many world-renowned marathon runners, relying on his pace runners as if he were running on track, and putting world records ahead of the competition.
However, this criticism hardly diminishes Gebrselassie's greatness in long-distance running.
Gebrselassie reached the midpoint with four Kenyan runners at 1:02:04 on Sunday.
Two top Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, gave the rhythm to Gebrselassie after the speed runners were tired.
Not much more than 4,8 km before the finish, Gebrselassie overtook Kwambai with one last sprint, finishing second at 2:05:36, improving his individual best by 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Kazakhstan-born Irina Mikitenko, who is now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year with her seventh fastest victory, 2:19:19.
The world record is set by British Paula Radcliffe at 2:15:25.
Last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko won the London Marathon with a surprise result of 2:24:14.
He was not allowed to participate in the Beijing Olympics due to his alleged back injury, but he recovered quickly and won the Berlin Marathon, where he improved his personal best by five minutes. This was the third marathon distance run he participated in.
He won the race with a clever calculation: first, he allowed a group of four Ethiopians and Kenyans to advance and gain significant leadership, and then after running about 30 km, he went after them.
Ethiopian Askale Tafa Magarsa finished second with a time of 2:21.31, while Kenyan Helena Kiprop finished third with a time of 2:25:01.
A Separate City, the Pride and Perplexities of Blacks
Located in Greater Orlando, a few miles from everything that glitters, sounds, and is huge, the theme park hides a quiet little town where the pride and complexities of the African-American experience of life are born.
Eatonville, the first purely black city to be integrated into the country and which was the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as it was described in 1935: "the five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guavas and two schools, without prison."
It's a place of pilgrimage now.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have attended the annual Zora Festival, a series of celebrations held in honor of Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
Yet, in many ways, the city he described and made a tourist attraction—which is also in the Florida guidebook published by the Federal Writers Project of the Depression—is separate from its surroundings.
As independent, dignified, and closed-minded as it was in the 1930s, Hurston wrote that black people in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with white people who “know so little about us that they don’t know what they’re missing.”
Even in the year when black presidential candidate Barack Obama calls for an open discussion on the race issue, many here distrust the gaze of outsiders.
“We’re very careful about how they tell our story,” said Hortense Jones, 59, who has lived here all her life and is a member of the city’s oldest church.
"You have to say it right."
Eatonville has long been characterized by the paradox of victory and struggle.
It is both a historic model of black engagement and a community of almost 2,400 people with poverty rates double the national average.
It is partly a literary node, and partly an example of a sometimes debased, sometimes lauded, southern, urban, black culture that flourishes in the shade of oak trees.
It’s no surprise that people here are proud and defensive at the same time.
The image of Eatonville has been important since Zora (here everyone calls Hurston).
In books written in honest, strong dialects, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937), he presented his hometown to the world.
The five paragraphs of the Florida guidebook transformed the city, which lies along Route 17. This road leads from the long-forgotten center of Florida to one of the sites of black history and human drama.
Hurston, who was as brave as a drum roll in both life and literature, introduced his readers to the business of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then looked into the more intimate spheres.
To the right of the road is the modern public school, with a brown background with white borders, carefully maintained courtyards and playgrounds, tended by Howard Miller, though he can hardly read or write.
She mentioned the widow Dash’s new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn “sells all kinds of drinks and anything that might be needed in the transitional accommodations.”
Thus, in a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to autonomy, but also to illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
It is clear that Fodor's guidebook presented it differently.
This description was not liked by everyone.
"Zora told things the way they were," reported 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls. They were immortalized by Hurston by quoting from the skimpy songs that men sang about their beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like that."
Hurston is still remembered here as the living eccentric who often visited his home after his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston stormed into town, he usually arrived unannounced in a roaring Chevrolet, smoking cigarettes, and wearing long pants, in a city where people are still proud of their dignified dress.
Most people were charmed, Franklin said, but many were foreboding it.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” Franklin said.
However, on the terrace overlooking Sabelia Lake, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he added, swinging in his chair: "He never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were not republished.
It seemed that Eatonville, along with most of the rest of the world, had forgotten about it.
Although once a popular writer, Langston is a contemporary of Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had lived before.
In Eatonville, there were no major commemorations or large public readings.
“I don’t think they understood how much he enriched the world, or what he left us,” said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston’s 2003 biography, Enveloped in the Rainbow.
The turning point came in 1980.
Orange County officials wanted to build a five-lane road through the city instead of the two-lane main street, Kennedy Avenue, which played an important role in the life of the community.
The expanding Orlando has already penetrated the interstate via Interstate 4 on the city's western border.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering after a difficult period of history.
Among other things, forced integration put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the struggles over racial mixing made the community taste the hate.
“At the time, a group of white boys came over and threw oranges and other things at people sitting on the side of the road,” Franklin said.
"There was a woman who died from this.
They threw a watermelon out of a car."
In a letter to The Orlando Sentinel in 1955, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's decision on violent integration, saying that the decision, "Brown v. Board of Education, offends rather than respects my species."
Today, residents say that the desegregation of schools, while in some respects positive, has weakened the cohesion of the Egonville people and undermined young people’s self-confidence.
“Black kids are used to being hugged — I remember — by a man hugging his teacher in the morning and in the evening,” N.Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins’ daughter, executive director of the nonprofit Preserve the Eatonville Community, said in a statement.
“This lasted as long as students and teachers came from a common place,” he added.
“We didn’t hug our white teacher because he was a white teacher — I mean, there were cultural differences between us,” Nathiri said.
However, human rights have helped lift many other Zora Neale Hurstons—black writers, actors, and artists who have risen above prejudice as he did, with self-confidence and lines as optimistic as these: “How can anyone deprive himself of the enjoyment of my company?
This is incomprehensible to me.”
In 1975, Alice Walker made a pilgrimage to Hurston’s unmarked grave and began to struggle to restore her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway was placed on the shelves of bookstores, re-emerging him as one of America's role models.
The road project would have started just as Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again in the spotlight.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw him as a savior.
The community began organizing a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the county would ruin with its main road.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and since then, many have returned to the celebration every January.
Several years later, the county withdrew its road construction proposal.
“Because of the five-lane highway, the community has been revitalised and switched to full speed, which is a real civic pride,” Nathiri said.
Boyd said, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road construction project helped change the city’s image of itself.
More and more people were coming from outside the city, such as attorney Rachelle Munson, who started going to church in 1993, and the locals began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the National Historical Register in 1998.
In 2006, a new, one-story library (named after Hurston, of course) was opened on the re-enveloped and beautified Kennedy Avenue.
Eatonville remains Florida's cuckoo's egg: it's not exactly ten kilometers from downtown Orlando, but it sometimes feels like a suburban side street during summer rain; as small as when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today, 90% of the population is black.)
The outsiders, who come here looking for Eatonville’s story and message, are still treated with caution.
Most interviews require prior permission, and some things—such as Eatonville’s oldest fresco, painted by a white man and depicting blacks working in the fields—should not be photographed.
In Eatonville, many, including the self-confident teacher Jones, who is particularly drawn to bright red, fear that their segregated community will be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston Festival became more and more widespread, the pride of the hometown also grew.
Young people, in particular, increasingly view Eatonville as Hurston saw his own race: wonderful, with its problems and everything, neither better nor worse, just as proud, creative, diligent, foolish and confused as other racial and ethnic groups in America.
There is a genuine civic attachment in the words of Franklin’s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return after college to take a job with the local government or the police that he believes are in need of help.
And it seems younger people have learned to describe Eatonville correctly, like the 11-year-old Winter Park twins Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
"Most people who just travel through here think this city is nothing compared to the rest," Alondra Kenon said recently after church service on Sunday.
“But if you stop and take some time to get to know its history, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York, we all speak the language of finance.
Nothing has changed on the surface.
If tourists didn’t mind the newsstands and huge TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t notice they were in the middle of a storm.
They would never realize that with glass-walled, beehive-shaped offices overhead, the bankers and hedge fund managers who control New York have been living through the most difficult days since 1929.
Couriers are still rolling their metal tea carts through the sidewalks, delivering trays of muffins for morning meetings.
Spanish-speaking men still shuffle between the blocks, carrying like a human mule fifty-something embroidered shirts that hang over their shoulders in a yoke-like loop.
Office workers are still waiting in line for their morning sweet pastries at the food trucks on the sidewalk, and it is still impossible to take a taxi on weekdays between 4 and 7 p.m.
I didn’t feel like there was any crisis until Thursday afternoon, despite all the ominous news, I decided to open a new bank account.
Although I had deliberately planned to settle the matter in the afternoon at the local branch of my JP Morgan Chase bank, I had about 20 people lined up in front of me.
Not at the cashier’s window, where you can withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service desk, where older customers order a checkbook, tourists ask for directions to Macy’s store, and where new customers open a bank account.
Many before me—I learned later from Starr, the banker “assigned to me”—were lined up with the same intention as I did.
However, unlike me, they have already withdrawn their money from smaller banks in their area of residence, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They took money from so-called savings banks (which are like housing cooperatives), credit unions, and small-town savings banks that operate in only one state and supposedly treat their customers as family members.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have gone silently bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in capital, has gone into receivership, and when New Yorkers left for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, was looking for a bank bailout with savings of $440 billion.
The office and shopkeepers in front of me, fearing another collapse, moved their money to a bank that seemed like a safe haven, the bank that makes the most capital injection buy-outs on Wall Street.
Over the past few weeks, ordinary New Yorkers have become experts in finance.
A woman at a local Chinese store spoke on her phone about the bankrupt Lehman Brothers bank and its giant-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, as if she were complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed custodian of my apartment block in his fifties, changed the subject, and we weren't talking about Brad and Angelina or my food delivery like we used to.
He said to me after I went to the bank: "I have invested all my savings in money market instruments.
I've changed, I'm not taking any chances."
Muslim graves desecrated while Austria tilted to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, of the right-wing Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, of the Belgian right-wing party, Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008, at which the organization "Cities Against the Islamic Conquest" was introduced.
They paraded with signs imitating traffic signs depicting mosques crossed by red lines.
According to police, far-right extremists are responsible for the defamation of Muslim cemeteries in Austria, which happened on the same weekend that far-right parties made significant headway in national parliamentary elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged in the Traun cemetery near Linz sometime between Friday night and this morning, according to police.
The perpetrators spray-painted Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David, on some graves, but investigators said they were only trying to hide their extreme motives, which stem from their hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is connected to the election in any way.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were “deeply shaken” by the desecration, which took place shortly before the end of the Muslim religious month of Ramadan.
Meanwhile, Austria is conducting an examination of conscience following yesterday's parliamentary elections, during which the language of political balances has been tipped to the right.
The two far-right parties, which won almost 30% of the vote, campaigned for the Future of Austria, a strongly anti-immigration law, and some of their slogans were branded xenophobic by their critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, president of the Freedom Party, which received more than 18 percent of the vote, expressed his disapproval of the campaign against headscarves and burqas, as well as food allegedly associated with Islam.
At the party’s final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” that would prevent the strengthening of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Opinion polls and analyses carried out immediately after the far-right elections show that the change was largely due to young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter banned from traveling abroad
Garry Glitter, a well-known rock star convicted of raping children, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
The judges decided to ban Glitter for six months after notifying the authorities controlling him of his intention to travel to Spain via France.
Kent police obtained the travel ban on Thursday after providing evidence to the court of convictions for child rape against Glitter.
Glitter, whose real name is Paul Gadd, did not attend the trial of Ashford Magistrates in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said: “On Thursday, 25 September, the Kent police filed an application with the Ashford Magistrates Court to prevent Paul Gadd from traveling to France and Spain on 25 March.
"Paul Gadd did not appear in person."
Glitter, 64, has informed authorities of his intention to travel abroad because he is obliged to do so under the law on sex offenders.
You must notify the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
You must also notify the police at least seven days before your planned departure.
If he does not notify the authorities, he may be sentenced to up to five years’ imprisonment.
Kent Police said they do not want to discuss individual cases within Glitter County and its possible whereabouts.
A spokesman for the Kent Police said: “The Kent Police are doing everything they can to protect children both inside the country and abroad.
“We think it’s easier to control someone if you don’t leave the UK because we have a comprehensive system in place to better manage potential risks.
"The most important task of the Kent Police is to protect the people of Kent. Through close cooperation, we continuously monitor the behaviour of people who are registered as sex offenders and live in the county, in order to minimize the potential risks to the population."
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for raping a 10-year-old and an 11-year-old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
However, he stated that he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
Authorities in Thailand refused to let him pass passport control, so he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him into the country, so he flew back to Bangkok, where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted he return to Britain.
Finally, he arrived at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3 on 22 August and stayed there until his lawyer, David Corker, went to court in Uxbridge, West London, as he had been registered as a sex offender under a court order, as Scotland Yard had requested.
Glitter had previously spent four months in prison in the UK for possession of photographs of child rape in 1999.
According to a Interior Ministry source, Home Secretary Jacqui Smith was reassured and delighted that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
“I don’t take photos on stage because I want to introduce the artist from a personal point of view.” – G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Bauer
No set, no ruffles, no dancing shoes.
The grand masters of flamenco up close, without the excitement of the performance: to get to know the everyday faces of the dancers.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, ordinary people.
And these two sides cannot be separated, except in the intimate moments away from the audience, when we can gaze at a personal gesture, grasp the depth of a caught look, or marvel at the beauty of the inactive but expressive hand of the artist who is not about to perform on stage.
The German G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Bauer in his photo series Flamenco-people combines the theatricality of singers, dancers and guitarists with this lesser-known everyday side of the masters.
Through the photographs, flamenco presents its specific iconography from different points of view.
The exhibition, which is part of the Flamenco Photography Month, "reflects the growing international significance of flamenco every day," the artist believes, adding that the flamenco-people "would be anyone's role, as the viewer realizes that these images do not represent artists in a typical way.
These street-shot people are artists who can bring passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and captivate the audience.
At the same time, stage photography is not suitable for capturing their personality.
Their personality and character reside in the very depths of their being.
I wanted to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to use the camera to capture the personalities of the greats of flamenco.”
Inspired by the Cante de las Minas festival, Bauer embarked on his long journey in 1997, using a record camera to create portraits of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers.
These portraits are reminiscent of classical photography thanks to the camera and the choice of theme.
The use of various stylistic tools, however, breaks with traditional pictorial representation and suggests modernity. The following thought faithfully reflects Bauer's idea of flamenco: "This is a music with traditional roots, however, it changes from day to day and is always impressive."
It is not the dance, not the song or the music in itself, but rather the personality and character of the artist that charms the audience.
The main motif of the works on display in the El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata Gallery these days is the search for an encounter with the essence, the artistic sorcery, which becomes visible through the way of perception, existence and representation.
Famous flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are the hallmarks of this collection of photographs featuring almost sixty artists.
The project has also become a flamenco anthology, and an album of portraits from the exhibition will soon be released.
Bauer's passion for portraits prompted him to repeat the idea two years ago with the series "Portraits of Veteran Athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concept of Flamenco-people is slightly different, the photographer adds: "I really like photographing people, getting to know them and stepping into their lives for a longer or shorter moment.
In my opinion, the most difficult genre of photography is the portrait.
You meet people, people you don’t even know, or people who only take a few minutes to take photos.
But as a photographer, I always try to live up to my vision.
The exhibition, entitled Flamenco-people, selected from contemporary flamenco portraits, can be seen in the El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata Gallery, located in the Calle de la Mata 20 parallel to Alameda de Hércules until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa says the novel he's working on is "ready-made audacity"
The location and plot are still unknown to him, but Mario Vargas Llosa is still working on a new novel. The main character of the novel is an Irish nationalist Roger Caseman, who lived in the Congo for twenty years and also visited the Amazon.
The writer, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature at the Hay Festival in Segovia, admitted yesterday that his current work is “ready-made recklessness” and “all signs point to the fact that we shouldn’t write” the novel.
“If I were smarter, I wouldn’t do it, but I’ll do it, and I hope to finish it sometime,” he concluded with these words at the Festival of Exchanges of Ideas, Thoughts and Opinions, which for four days hosted hundreds of writers, historians and journalists, as well as thousands of visitors, in the city of Aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the most prominent participants in the celebration of literature, and lived up to the hopes placed in him.
Vargas Llosa was awarded the Hay Festival Award, an old edition of Dickens' novel "Our Common Friend". His performance filled the theater of Juan Bravo.
After Félix Romeo’s greeting, he was greeted by a devoted audience. The audience soon received the lesson, during which the Peruvian writer Victor told with amazing memory and a great deal of humor, how his profession of writing was shaped by his passion for reading and the desire to live life, by his passion for writing, by his profession of writing; how he bridged his lack of inspiration with a disciplined method of writing, by his diligence.
The Latin-American novelist admitted that it is impossible to measure or show whether books change our lives, but added, "I don't think literature is just entertainment or a busy life's experience" because it affects people and makes them think, so he asked the writers not to give in to the temptation of lightness and take responsibility for their vocation.
Due to the bad weather the farewell in Pozoblanco is shorter, the riding bullfights are also cancelled
Traditionally held as the closing event of the Pozoblanco festivities, the horse and bullfight was cancelled yesterday morning after future riders found the arena unsuitable for the competition.
As a result, the committee, in agreement with Ferm<0xC3><0xAD>n Boh<0xC3><0xB3>rquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza, and Leonardo Hernández, decided to cancel the bullfight.
The vicissitudes of the weather devastated the series of celebrations, as two of the three events could not be held.
On Saturday, the second bullfight was cancelled due to rain.
The main characters would have been José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>az and Juan Bautista Castilblanco.
There was only a bullfight on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who took home three ears as trophies. After a sophisticated and aesthetic fight, he was carried around on his shoulders.
That same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante earned several accolades and a single ear as a trophy for his two bulls, but this was due more to his audience than to his own performance.
This was followed by El Juli, who made little contribution to the reputation of the Los Llanos arena.
After a comfortable ride with the second bull, a large part of the audience was able to get out of the mood.
A van carrying two tons of hashish tried to escape a road check in <0xC3><0x81>lava
It's 4:50 in the morning.
The Basque Regional Police conducts traffic control in the administrative area of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
The authorities stop a van with two people in it, and the passengers try to escape the action.
The shipment, more than two tons of hashish, at the same time, was not conspicuous.
Investigators pursued the passengers and one of them, a 28-year-old man, was arrested and identified as A.A.J., the Basque government’s Interior Department said.
The man was charged with drug trafficking and falsification of documents.
The incident took place in the administrative area of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n, where employees of the <0xC3><0x81>lava Traffic Authority conducted a traffic check on the N-1 highway.
When they wanted to stop the van, the driver refused to obey, suddenly gave gas, and then left the site of the inspection.
Investigators chased him, then the vehicle stopped a few kilometres from the stop strip, and the passengers fled from the highway to a wooded area.
The Basque Regional Police eventually arrested one of them and, after searching the Iveco Daily van, confiscated a shipment of 2,178 kilograms of hashish.
The hash bales, which filled the rear of the vehicle, were transported by police authorities to undergo a more thorough investigation and to measure the drug.
In addition, during the inspection, it was proved that the false license plate of the vehicle does not match the data in the documents of the van, therefore, the arrested person is also prosecuted for the forgery of public documents.
The Basque Regional Police is continuing the investigation, which is aimed, on the one hand, at arresting the other suspect, who, as has already been mentioned, fled from the motorway, and, on the other hand, at determining the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old defendant, A.A.J., was taken to the police station to conduct the necessary interrogations, and within a few hours the court action began.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, was arrested over the weekend by police in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of medication.
“A witness said he was attempting to leave the parking lot in Montecito with strange maneuvers,” a spokesman for California’s traffic control agency told People magazine.
According to the witness, around 4:30 p.m., Locklear "knocked on the floor, moaned the engine, tried to leave the parking lot both forwards and backwards, and went through his sunglasses several times in reverse."
Soon after, the witness, who at first probably did not recognize the actress, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and get out of the car.
He called the police because he was "concerned about Locklear's life."
When the police arrived, the actress was sitting in her car, which partially paralysed the traffic on the highway.
"He seemed confused," so patrols took him to a specialized center for drug and alcohol testing.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol consumption was ruled out almost immediately. The spokesman also said that based on the officers' first impressions, it is believed that she was under the influence of the drug Locklear.
Locklear was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of an unidentified drug, and was transferred to the local prison around 7:00 p.m., where he was released a few hours later.
Locklear came out of a sanitarium in Arizona two months ago, where he was being treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares calls on the IU (United Left) Andalusian Federation to take action on the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, the general secretary of the IU and a representative of the United Left, said today that the regional federation of the formation will decide on the case of the former youth and sports councillor of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva. Silva resigned last week after being accused of abusing his position to give benefits to his family members.
"In these matters I am a federalist to a large extent, and this matter is within the competence of the Andalusian organisation," Llamazares said, pointing out the party's policy against a former member of the Seville City Council.
On the other hand, the IU President stressed the need for "transparency" when investigating possible irregularities committed by Silva: "At IU, we have always advocated maximum transparency in such cases."
He added that the trainings include "a strict code of ethics for civil servants."
"Mayal Blood", an epic creation by Garci
Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s’ National Episodes was inspired by José Luis Garci, who recalls the Spanish’s famous anti-French uprising in the Blood of May, which, with a budget of nearly 15 million euros, is the largest work of his filmography.
Accordingly, the director attempted to illustrate in the work of the well-known novelist the flood of people and social analysis that he had always admired. Today, at the film premiere, Garci shared this with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a to the large audience of actors.
The two-and-a-half-hour-long May Blood will be shown in cinemas on Friday, and later Telemadrid will screen it as a mini-series in a length of more than four hours.
José Luis Garci, a great admirer of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s’s literature, made his childhood dream come true with this filming. All thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago from the Province of Madrid to make a commemorative film for the 200th anniversary of the events of 2 May in Madrid. Garci accepted the invitation on condition that the story be based on the National Epizo.
The budget of 15 million euros was financed entirely by the Autonomous Province of Madrid and represented a special opportunity for Garci: he was able to present the “distraught Spaniards who mistakenly sided with the wrong leader, because the fight for independence plunged the country into a huge backwardness with the reign of Ferdinand VII,” he said.
However, the director expressed regret that he could not count on the budget of Alatriste or Goya's phantoms, who more than doubled the May blood. For this reason, he was forced to omit some scenes from the script, which, as on many other occasions, is recorded with Horacio Valcárcelli.
So the director of Restart resorted to his usual way of working, filming scenes with actors with whom he had already begun rehearsals before filming. Casting was not, because Garci considers it "humiliating" and because, as he said, "it is part of the director's craft to go to the theater and cinema to find out what is going on in the industry in which we work."
Several May Blood actors, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga and Fernando Guillen Cuervo, have not stepped in front of their cameras for the first time.
Garci, who has four Oscar nominations and an Academy Award, believes that this year’s nominees for Spain before the Hollywood Academy, i.e. May blood, the Seven French billiard tables and the final selection of Blind Sunflowers, do not represent the young generation of Spanish cinema, “where they should be shown,” he said.
Garci doesn't expect any awards with this film.
“Initially you think you’re working for posterity, then you realize that all that matters is success, and then you’re happy to have another movie,” Garci says after a career of almost 30 years.
Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n recalls the life and art of the Seville dancer T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville commemorates a dancer from Seville.
Carmen T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola was born in the Triana district of Valencia, Spain, to a Catalan father (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela) and moved to London with her parents at the age of three.
He was an artist of free dance and an expert in oriental dance.
Throughout her busy life, she has been a pioneer in the fight for women’s equality, whether it be Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian, and fought against the use of corsets to restrict women's freedom of movement.
She sparked a dance and aesthetic revolution in wartime Europe, and her life fascinated Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, who recommended T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola, whose personality really impressed me."
The flamenco dancer said: “Our goal is not to tell your life story, but to capture your spirit.
The titles of his dances reminded me of flamenco styles.
For example, "butterfly dance" to guajira, or "snake dance" to tango.
"He was sensually dancing and others say it's my style," she says.
The light of the performance is highlighted by two extraordinary contributors: Miguel Poveda after the Open Door, now sings again at Isabel’s performance; and Matilde Coral, who in this case exceptionally wanted to work with a former student.
"Matilde plays the elder T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola, the mature woman.
I’m happy that he said yes to the invitation, and I’m very honoured that he will perform in my piece.”
In addition, the production will feature music directors and guitarists Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres and Paco Arriaga, singers Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; percussionist El Pájaro, viola player Rafa El Viola, and actor Juanfra Juárez, who "plays the constant character of the real diva, constantly besieging her love."
The play also largely depicts the life of a woman who lives in London, but also travels across Europe and even to far-flung lands, including India, the United States and Italy.
“I wanted to commemorate him because his personality had a great impact on his time, but today his work is not known and even less appreciated,” Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n says.
The performance starts tonight at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
At the end of the Triennium, the "Diary of a newly married poet" will also appear.
The first illustrated edition of The Diary of a Newly Married Poet will be presented at Saint Stephen's Church, New York, where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married Zenobia in May 1916. The presentation is part of a series of programs commemorating the anniversary of Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Triennium (2006-2008) and organized by the Cultural Committee of the Andalusian Regional Government for two years.
Thus, the closing chord of Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Triennium is the re-issue of this work, the International Congress in New York, the restoration of the Nobel Prize-winning poet's memorial house and the travelling exhibition "Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez: The Bright Poplar Tree". The exhibition opened in May this year, visited several Andalusian provinces and planned to visit the International Congress in New York.
The Cultural Committee of the Andalusian Regional Government has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the diary of a newly married poet, published by Perdo Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to promote the reputation and work of one of the most versatile Andalusian poets.
Without Paul Newman, America is not so attractive.
Sometimes God makes perfect people.
Paul Newman was like that.”
The quote comes from actress Sally Field, who worked with Newman on The Victims of Sensation, and reflects the shock and helplessness caused by Newman’s death in the American cinema industry and throughout America.
How hard it is to win an Oscar.
Retired in 2007,
He was known to be ill,
But even so, everyone was shocked by his death.
“Sometimes it’s impossible to put our feelings into words, and I’ve lost a good friend,” Robert Redford said with tears, “his being has made my life and this country better.”
No one was afraid of being ridiculed or exaggerating.
One of the heroes of cinema and home went through a particularly dark period, overshadowed by fear of terrorism and market conditions, a desperate search for American self-esteem and dignity.
When times are hard and many lose their virtues and there are very few people left to look up to, you don’t have to be Luis Cernuda to admire Paul Newman.
In the eyes of men he was the very embodiment of the platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
Richard Nixon was a formal enemy and defender of lost and won causes, ranging from the creation of an anti-drug foundation in memory of his first-born son, who died of a drug overdose, to the creation of his homemade organic food brand.
It was a real gift for a country that had a hard time overcoming its suicidal eating culture.
The overwhelming wave of admiration spread throughout Hollywood, regardless of nationality or origin.
According to the last James Bond, Daniel Craig, it was not a man, but an era that died with him.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning Sam Mendes, said that his work with Newman was clearly the culmination of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad guy from Australia, called Newman his biggest inspiration.
“He’s set the bar very high for all of us,” said George Clooney, who is perhaps one of the few people who today attempt to follow Paul Newman’s lifestyle: demanding honesty and privacy, both serious and away from the cameras.
This is not always easy, if at all possible, in today’s media jungle.
And yet there are those who try, and Paul Newman is his role model.
She divorced once, but then married faithful Joanne Woodward for 50 years, even though she would have had many opportunities for infidelity.
"Why should I eat hamburgers if I have roast meat at home?" he joked.
In heaven, you can be proud that on earth you are also a fan of your daughters, which is not very common in America.
“Of all his performances, he was never more proud than of his faithful husband, loving father, caring grandfather, and devoted philanthropist role,” they say.
The Road to the Madrid Olympics
Indeed, many of us dream of an Olympic Games in Madrid, and after the 2012 failed, it may well be 2016.
But, I ask you, are we really prepared?
'Cause if we start from yesterday's race, I don't think it's a race at all.
It was called the perfect race, but in my view it was the worst of many I have ever been to.
It was full of nonsense, and if it had to be evaluated, and I was the examiner, it would clearly be a failure.
But let’s go ahead and start at the beginning.
The nonsense started with the receipt of the serial number, because for this reason it was necessary to arrive earlier.
This is not a problem in itself, but if you go earlier, at least get everything at the same time (including the chip, to avoid standing in the next line).
That's not what happened.
At first they gave me only the number (first pointless thing, just to go there sooner) and (after standing in the usual line), what a surprise, it was only an S-shirt (second pointless thing, because my size is exactly XL)!
What world are we living in?
Or is it because of the crisis that they decided to save on the material and only buy cheaper, small-sized T-shirts?
But anyway, these things are still dwarfed by what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that we had to go there awfully early to pick up the chip, the queue took 15 minutes from the time of arrival, and even the backpack had to be handed over.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a running race with more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race started, and we hadn't given up the backpack yet, and when we finally did, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain made it even more pleasant to wait for more than 40 minutes, which was interspersed with popular insurrection and stand-attack attempts.
I think by tomorrow we'll have about 500 pneumonias, and some of us, myself included, won't be able to get our place in our actual time, because I'm assuming that my chip recorded the start incorrectly.
If you asked me about the perfect running race, I wouldn't think of that, of course.
So I think we can continue to dream about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the MIT Emerging Technologies conference, Microsoft presented the development of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of - not very intelligent - artificial intelligence, which, however, is able to perform some basic tasks. For example, it can call a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, a vehicle traveling on the territory of the company) based on the information heard from the conversation.
Using a camera and a form and face recognition system, this “receptionist” is able to recognize how many people are in the room, who they are – and even what clothes they are wearing – and to hear and understand the key words of their conversations.
In addition, you can group attendees based on the conversations.
In the video, the receptionist identifies a third person, but she knows that she does not belong to the company she is talking to, nor is she an employee of the company.
He asks if he has come to visit someone and assures him that he will soon come to his aid.
All without the blue screen.
Fascinating.
This is, of course, the music of the future.
At the moment, the company has more important things to do, such as developing a new version of the Windows operating system.
A lot of people are saying that Microsoft is changing its strategy.
Windows 7 will be smaller and have fewer additional programs.
Steve Ballmer realized that if computers ran only the programs they needed instead of a lot of commercial garbage, the machines would be five times faster — bravo, Steve, that's something.
They invented the Spanish wax, considering that Microsoft has added extra features and extras to Windows in every new version so far.
The change of direction will pay off.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is increasingly in the background, and so is the software itself.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, I joined the theory that Google had taken the first step to become a competitor to Windows.
Many people have correctly recognized that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be needed, as it is an indispensable element for the dialogue between hardware and software.
He plays the same role as your wife or husband when you want to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but it is necessary to take into account the "death" of the operating system, not in absolute, but in relative terms.
Ballmer’s statement this week supports this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and more and more attention to the web browser.
You turn on your computer just to open Firefox or Explorer — or Chrome — and you spend more time browsing than you do in the world of windows.
So what are most of the applications that come with the system?
Less is sometimes more.
And Windows 7 is less, it has to be much less than Vista.
Less cumbersome, less overburdened, less complicated.
Microsoft’s goal is to integrate its services more online, and to end up being an alternative to Google.
They need it, and I’ll give you an example of why.
This photo was taken earlier this month in a Microsoft employee lounge in Redmond.
There's a poster on the soda machine telling them to use the company's browser. "Your browser. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to browse the web.
Last week, a new version of Windows Mobile 7 was released.
Not at the beginning of 2009, but at the end of 2010.
Microsoft is likely to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
After all, the mobile phone is increasingly becoming a computer.
But the delay, given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, will definitely hurt their business.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
It was worn by Pablo Picasso on the Costa Azulon, by Leonardo di Caprio in Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond, by Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather, and it is one of the basic clothes of the hard-boiled gay public.
And speaking of the list of specialties, we can recall the peace figure of the weightlifter with the tangled mustache of the travelling circus.
But what are we talking about? It's nothing more than a - typically tight and sleeveless - men's cotton shirt.
That is, the "tank", as they call it, but none of its rivals can compete with the le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles.
First of all, because of the elegant name - although among friends it is only referred to as "Marcel" - that he owes to the sport, because according to legend, Marcel Cerdan got his name from the boxer, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel’s excellent cotton material, unisex cut, unique logo and the small (almost recognisable) Belgian flag make it stand out from the competition. The latter is carried by the most distinctive models hidden in the neck of the T-shirt.
However, the Belgian company does not only produce tank tops.
Sports tops, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, wool pants, sailor T-shirts, baby clothes, mini-sorts - and more - are all products of the company.
And they all fall into the category of comfortable underwear,
It is also a pity that they have to be worn as undergarments.
They're too good for that.
"I want to be a young mother; it doesn't matter who the father is."
He is very similar to his brother, but at the same time he managed to realize himself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but full of energy.
At the moment, the Cruz sisters want to play a more serious role in the world of fashion.
For Monica, modeling means more than just a few pretty girls giving her name to something.
She was present at the promotion of Mango’s new headquarters in Paris and at the award ceremony of the most prestigious fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
There is a feeling of warmth and gentleness in it.
What are you actually doing in Paris?
We present Mango’s new autumn-winter collection, which was designed with my brother Penélope. In addition, we will participate in the announcement of the second competition of the ‘Mango Fashion Awards’ and the gala dinner in honour of Valentino at the Opera.
It's quite a busy day, but it's very exciting.
This is your fourth season at Mango. Where did you get the inspiration for the new collection?
We both love the movies of the '50s and '60s; we've taken over a lot of things from there.
And then, I often go around the city and watch women, how they dress, how they vary and choose their clothes - it's one of my favorite pastimes.
You also work as a dancer, actress and fashion designer. You are a versatile woman, right?
I think so too, but in the end these three things are related, because they have a lot in common.
I was interested in clothes from an early age, and I couldn’t wait to go to my grandmother’s house and rummage through my aunt’s wardrobe.
Now, that was you in Canaan, almost equal to an amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to how I dress.
You know, we dancers like to come up with our own style for lessons and rehearsals so that we can have fun when we look in the mirror.
And in the role of an actress, you really identify with your role when you get the costume.
You see, everything is connected, and with all due respect to the designers and their expertise.
You just celebrated your 30th birthday, didn't you get lethargic?
No, no, no.
I feel better than ever, I love my 30s.
I think women are really mature by this time, they are experienced enough and make fewer mistakes in life.
The biological clock doesn't bother me.
I have been doing what I want to do since I was a child, and this gives me great inner happiness.
Do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I’m going to be a mother because I was born to be a woman, and I want to be a young mother, and I definitely don’t want to miss that.
As for the father-to-be, it doesn't matter who it is.
I would like to raise my child in happiness and great love.
Let's say a few words about the movie, you made a lot of movies last year that weren't even shown.
Yeah, and I can't wait for them to come out.
I, who started in theatre, am very impatient and restless, I want everything immediately, but of course I know that this is impossible.
I look forward to the presentation of The Last Hour and the search for the tomb of Christ.
I wonder what you think of them...
I understand you made your runway debut a few days ago with Naomi Campbell.
No, that's not true.
I didn't go on the runway as a model.
I have known Naomi Campbell for a long time and she simply invited me to a charity fashion show in London for her own Women for a Better World organisation. I chose two own Mango collections. The clothes presented were auctioned and the proceeds were donated to Naomi’s NGO.
People don't know how good-hearted Naomi is.
There's so much talk about him, I know him, and I assure you, half of it isn't true.
On the other hand, I always look at the positive side of his work.
He asked me to go to the fashion show for a noble cause, but if he wanted me to stand on my head, I'd do it.
If the fate of women in the Third World is at stake, I don't know the impossible.
Drunk Driving Drivers Will Be Forced to Install 'Alcolock'
The Interior Ministry would require the driver to install a device after three drunk driving offences that would prevent the vehicle from starting if the driver is drunk or does not blow into the device.
The proposal was presented in June and is now being dealt with by the Public Prosecutor’s Office, according to which the pilot project will last one year.
As the project aims to bring the vehicle back into circulation, the driver will also have to take part in a repeat course on traffic education.
In addition to the Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office, the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Foundation for Automotive Safety Technology (FITSA) are also involved in the experiment.
According to statistics, 30-75% of drivers who have been arrested several times for drunk driving are back in their cars.
This would be prevented by Alcolock, because the system connected to the vehicle determines the alcohol level of the air blown into it. If it is higher than the allowed level, or if the driver has not blown into the device at all, the system will not allow the car to start.
The cost of an instrument costing more than EUR 1 000 would be borne by the infringer.
A 2007 study in the US showed that vehicles equipped with such instruments could reduce the number of violations by up to 65% in the first year after installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved each year.
The measure focuses on offences for two reasons: on the one hand, it is easier to prevent them from becoming offences,
on the other hand, it is easier to introduce, as the legal reform is being implemented in the usual way, while the necessary criminal reform would require a fundamental law amendment.
The instrument is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although in experimental mode it has already been installed in some industrial and public service vehicles.
The Chamber of Deputies will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party to install the system in school buses, following the example of France.
In Mexico, in closed shoes
At 5:40 p.m., the Spanish Air Force’s Asturias Princely Party aircraft landed in the presidential hangar at Mexico City’s Benito Juárez Airport.
The sun was already setting, but it was still so hot that we could only see the royal couple coming out of the plane using our hands as blinders.
At the foot of the stairs stood the Spanish ambassador and other dignitaries.
A few hours before, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew the Spanish Prince and Duchess were coming to town for an official visit.
- Well, then there won't be an airport transfer for a while today...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish. She just lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, well...
But the Mexican press, they know all about the Duke and Duchess of Asturias and the significance of their visit.
Many are waiting at the red carpet of the airport hangar, a cordon made up of 27 marines who serve to protect dignitaries.
The Prince appears, smiling, in a sea-blue dress, and then the Princess too, with her long hair caught in the wind, in restrained dress, but not in the usual toe-flashing shoes—perhaps a warning that Mexico City was threatened by a storm.
They stop for a moment and smile for the cameras, then enter the room, where the official reception will take place.
At the gate of their hotel, which is one of the four largest hotels in the city, they are greeted by a chatty reporter from Mexican television.
The Most Valuable Fashion Award
Paris is undoubtedly the most suitable place in the world to present a fashion award, and Valentino is undoubtedly the most sophisticated and the coolest of all fashion designers alive today.
Mango recently announced the second edition of the El Boton-Mango Fashion Awards, which aims to introduce young talents of the fashion industry to the international scene.
The prize is 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first tender, saw her own-designed clothes in the Mango shop window at 54 boulevard Haussmann in Paris, and was almost tearing from emotion.
By the way, this is the company's second largest store in Europe and recently opened on 1,335 square meters.
The biggest business is in London.
Amidst the many events and thanks to Valentino for chairing the jury, we finally found ourselves at a luxury dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
In the company of the most enjoyable Chagalok, the presidential table for the gala dinner, prepared by Mango, looked even more spectacular.
Nati, who came with a heavy heart and sadness because of the recent death of her brother, wore a piece of the Company and some of the breathtaking ornaments of ELAH. She accompanied Valentin to the main table of the dinner in his honor, together with his son Luis, who was nearly two meters tall.
Andik, the owner and host of Mango, entertained the guests. Together with Baron Rotchil, they were so chivalrous that in the end they were left without a suit, since each of them gave it to a lady.
Monica Cruz arrived at the shop in her own-designed trousers and shirt, and at dinner she was wearing a sexy long black dress. During the night visit to the opera, she became so enthralled with Gaya Toledo’s company in the ballet hall that, recalling the old days, she slithered to one of the bars and improvised a grand plie.
Inés Sastre did not participate in the visit to the palace, but before that he showed me some photos of his son on his mobile phone.
The next morning we could admire Oliver Martinez - he is almost two meters tall and rides a motorbike - and John Travolta arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris. He also brought his own sheets and towels and told us in advance that he did not want any perfume in the room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh l<0xC3><0xA0> l<0xC3><0xA0>, c'est la vie.
1001, the stress-relieving number
Not 1,000, but 1,000 and one ways to turn off chaotic and messy weekdays.
Another good news is that you can find them all in a single book that arrives in bookstores on September 30th to bring you peace of mind.
The bell ringing at 7 a.m. is almost excruciating, but it’s even worse to think about how fast the world is forcing you to live every day.
The name of the office is tension, and the name of the computer is back pain.
Stress is a disease of the 21st century.
But there are not one or two ways to overcome daily exhaustion and overcome problems at work.
No, this number is exactly equal to 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classic massages or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in her book so that everyone can find the solution that suits their needs and free time.
The stress-relieving work is called the 1001 relaxation method, and the calm emanating from it comes to bookstores from Pearson Alhambra y DK.
If you are convinced that stress in the world of work or personal relationships can hardly be eliminated, this manual will certainly shake your faith.
What’s more, it also offers other ideas to help you relax, such as tips on how to get closer to nature or how to prepare 100% natural foods.
If your adrenaline levels are already too low to refresh your body and stress has become a central problem in your life, it’s time to sit back in your chair, relax and focus on reading.
Those who speak in dreams
Some kids talk at night.
I don’t mean those who wake up and tell me what happened to them that day, but those who talk while they sleep.
The phenomenon may seem frightening at first, but it is actually completely harmless.
This benign sleep disorder is called somniloquismus.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
I'm sure some of you have been told that you spoke at night.
It can be completely rhapsodic in frequency (for example, it occurs only once in a disease with a high fever) or more regular (once a day, week or month), and usually the child does not remember anything the next day.
Its appearance cannot be traced back to a single cause.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night terrors, nocturnal urination or sleepwalking, but this is not normal.
As mentioned above, it can be a symptom of a high-fever condition, or even a stressful situation or a state of heightened excitement.
It has been studied little so far.
The intensity of speech also varies greatly.
It may be quiet, it may consist of words and muttering that are not related, but in contrast, it may be in the form of shouting, crying, or longer speech.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is advisable to observe the child and consult a specialist. The examination may reveal whether there is a problem that is causing great anxiety and therefore may offer a solution.
As mentioned above, this is a benign phenomenon and therefore there is no cure unless it is accompanied by another treatable form of sleep disorder (such as insomnia or stress).
However, there are a few things we can do, here is a bunch of preventive measures:
Make sure the child stays calm before going to bed.
Choose calming toys and avoid watching fear-inducing or more aggressive TV shows or series.
For children who are prone to nervousness or are more difficult to relax, we teach some relaxation methods to help them find inner peace.
This will help the child to sleep better.
If you start talking while you sleep, try to stay calm.
Remember, this is harmless for the child, and the next day they will remember nothing.
Helpful advice
Do not wake the child.
It would be unnecessary, because the child is not conscious, but he would be out of sleep.
In fact, even though he’s talking, he’s still sleeping and resting.
Remember, if the phenomenon is accompanied by intense anxiety several times, it is recommended to consult a specialist or explore what provokes a high level of anxiety in the child.
If he speaks clearly (this is a rarer case), do not start asking him questions in order to learn anything from him.
It would be useless anyway, since during sleep you are not so conscious to collect your thoughts.
On the other hand, you can only hear the speech, but you cannot see the dream images associated with it, so be careful with the interpretation of what you hear and possible conclusions.
Never tell a child that they can ask about their secrets at night.
Not even a joke.
This causes a great deal of anxiety.
So the most important thing is not to worry, as it is only a harmless episode of a few minutes.
Illhaeusern at last
After a long dive, the Illhaeusern team finally gained new momentum and won again at home.
Although it wasn’t a spectacular match, the yellow-blacks got into a situation several times, one of which they were able to win in the end.
The pace of the match was not too tight, as the attackers found it difficult to find the right rhythm.
The first shot was attempted by Kauffmann, the captain of the away team, but the distant ball just touched the top corner of the goalpost. Then the Illhaeusern came to the fore, and the shots followed one after the other: Fonderflick tried a distant shot, then the shot of Hirn flew over the goal.
On the other side, the players defended in a block in the midfield, and only the ever-moving Riahi was placed in the shooting position.
The start of the second half was crucial: Riahi and Temporale took the first position on the Dannemarie side. The first goal was immediately scored: after Diebold’s first shot, the ball was bounced by the Marais of illhaeusern with an excellent position and then into the goal (53rd minute).
The Illhausern goal scorer, however, did not enjoy the glory for long: twelve minutes later, he was forced to leave the pitch, and his teammates had to continue the fight with a human handicap.
The Dannemarie, however, could not take advantage of this advantage: they didn’t cause much trouble for the home team, who just pulled back a little to strengthen their defense. The last few seconds alone held some excitement, when after a lot of haste the ball came very close to the goalpost.
Sarkozy Meets Angry Fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy makes a detour to Brittany.
On Monday, the fishermen’s demonstration crippled traffic in several Breton and Norman ports. Therefore, the President of the Republic decided to pay a visit to the port of Le Guilvinec in Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re on Tuesday morning to meet with representatives of the demonstrators.
The latter promised to welcome the president in a “constructive spirit” and expressed their hope that Sarkozy “will come with concrete proposals”.
The presidential visit coincides with the meeting of the "crisis committee", which was set up by Breton fishermen with the aim of taking action against the rise in the price of diesel oil, as the price of oil exceeded the average record price of 1.14 euros per liter.
David Martinon, a spokesman for the president of the Republic, said: “The president will discuss with fishermen how to help companies regain their competitiveness and make working conditions and wages safer for seafarers.
The fishermen are eagerly awaiting the arrival of Nicolas Sarkozy.
On Tuesday morning, in Morbihan and Calvados counties, demonstrations were held to slow traffic, causing congestion of nearly 10 km in length.
Traffic at Quiberon's marina was also halted, but roads to Belle-<0xC3><0xAE>le were not blocked.
There are roadblocks on the Quiberon Peninsula.
On Monday, the sailors had already demonstrated their determination, and at dawn they burned tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots in the ports of Brest, while demonstrations took place in Concerneau and Saint-Brieuc.
In the Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, for example, fishermen did not board a ship, while in Le Havre, some twenty ships were blocking commercial vessels.
In the evening, fishermen from La Turballe and Le Croisic in the department of Loire-Atlantique lifted the blockade of the giant Total oil refinery in Donges.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer, on the other hand, decided to wait for a meeting at the ministry on Wednesday to decide on further steps.
In Le Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will have to decide on Tuesday on its next move and its participation in a meeting scheduled at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want their interests to be represented by the leaders of the national fisheries committee, which did not support their efforts.
"The strike will go on" because "fishermen refuse to give in to their demands" and "they refuse to go to Paris", for example, said Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Commission.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay tax on diesel fuel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but believe that the only way to make a vessel profitable would be to reduce the price of diesel fuel to below EUR 0.30 per litre.
The Wonderful Paul Newman
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, 83, died of cancer at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes paid tribute to Paul Newman, a movie legend and aspiring actor who passed away at the age of 83.
Embraer does not change its transport plans for 2008
Despite the crisis threatening the world economy, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer plans to deliver 215 aircraft this year.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, is on track to deliver 215 aircraft in 2008, according to Fredrico Fleury Curado, president of Embraer.
In the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturing company is heavily expecting the Chinese market, especially for its 30-120-seat aircraft.
Embraer has delivered a total of 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG to sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, an insurance company set up by the US financial authorities, intends to sell more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion it has advanced, the Dominican edition of the Financial Times reported.
In addition to its international life insurance and U.S. pension insurance operations, AIG would be divesting most of its other businesses, the newspaper said, citing sources close to the case.
According to the Times, AIG’s board of directors met on Sunday evening to discuss the sale.
AIG has not confirmed this information.
The assets to be sold by AIG include the company’s aircraft leasing company International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments.
However, according to the newspaper, there is no final decision on the sale.
AIG needs to obtain liquid assets quickly to repay the $85 billion loan approved by the U.S. government, taking the risk of having to divest up to 80% of its capital and losing a corresponding proportion of its shareholders.
Study by Paris Historique on the Historic Morning Meeting of the Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange announced a historic downturn on Monday after the Senate rejected Paulson’s bank rescue plan. The Dow Jones index fell by 6.98% (an unprecedented fall of nearly 800 points) and the Nasdaq by 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
The largest decline in the index to date (684.81 points) was recorded on September 17, 2001, when trading resumed following the September 11 terrorist attack.
Based mainly on technology papers, the Nasdaq closed at 1,983.73 points with a 199.61-point drop, while the Standard & Poor's 500's expanded index fell 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points, according to official closing data.
The Wall Street Stock Exchange was already weak at the time of its opening, and when the Senate unexpectedly rejected a bank rescue plan aimed at restoring market equilibrium, it plunged into a depression.
With 228 votes against 205 votes against, MPs refused to provide the funds requested by Finance Minister Henry Paulson.
The plan was rejected by nearly two-thirds of Republicans.
“The market has picked up some bad signals because Congress seems unable to approve a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza, an analyst at FTN Financial.
“This shows how much the market was counting on this plan,” he added, expressing concern that if such a plan were adopted a few days later, it would be “too late.”
“If the plan is truly doomed, it will be up to the Fed and the other central banks to address the crisis, and credit conditions will continue to tighten,” said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
To further heighten the sense of urgency, Piegza adds: “Every day that passes, more and more financial institutions fail” in the United States.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, authorities made sure that Wachovia’s banking businesses would be acquired by rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated abruptly, which has necessitated emergency measures to rescue banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany. This indicates that the market has "evolved into a crisis not only American, but worldwide," adds analyst for FTN Financial.
The bond market has picked up significantly.
The yield on the 10-year government bond fell from 3.827% to 3.632% on Friday evening, while the yield on the 30-year-old fell from 4.357% to 4.161% on the previous day.
Obama wins first televised duel
The first debate between the two candidates on Friday was followed by another, which had to decide whether John McCain or Barack Obama would emerge from the duel as the winner.
Unsurprisingly, both Republican and Democratic campaigners claimed victory in a televised duel that was watched by a third of American households.
According to political analyst David Gergen, while John McCain’s performance was respectable, it did not prove “impressive” enough to halt the decline in popularity, as evidenced by polls conducted five weeks before the presidential election.
According to Gallup, the Democratic candidate is better in the fight: According to the results of the poll published on Saturday, Obama has a five-point advantage over McCain (44% and 49%).
Among the most prolific, yet indecisive voters, 39% say Obama will win, while 25% expect McCain to win, according to a survey conducted by CBS.
Obama is expected to increase his lead with his party’s Joseph Biden, who is preparing for Biden’s first and only public debate with rival Sarah Palin.
Bill Clinton, however, warned over the weekend: “It would be a mistake to underestimate Palin.
He has good instincts.”
McCain, in his seventies, never fails to bring to the fore his own indisputably vast foreign policy experience, while emphasizing his opponent’s “naiveness” on these issues, which were at the heart of their first face-to-face meeting.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that," the attack was repeated several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and the knowledge to be president,” McCain said.
This is the main attack platform that has been exploited by Republican TV ads running since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, emphasized that he represents the future.
He did not allow himself to be embarrassed: he spoke concisely and accurately.
He stressed his ability to make good decisions and restore the world’s image of the United States.
“McCain still doesn’t understand it, Obama does,” the Republican leader said in a statement on Sunday, saying he still hadn’t assessed the impact of the crisis on America’s “street people.”
“In the 90 minutes of this debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me and nothing to say about you,” Obama said at a rally in North Carolina in front of 20,000 people.
He did not even utter the words "middle class" or "workers". The chaotic situation in the financial world undoubtedly favors Obama, whom the Americans consider the most suitable to save the economy on the verge of collapse.
“Next week could prove to be a turning point,” said Charles Schumer, a prominent Democratic senator.
Democrat Rahm Emanuel, a veteran of the Clinton administration, said Obama had "excellent instincts in the field of the economy" as Bill Clinton did during the financial crisis in 1998.
In the eyes of the Democratic presidential candidate, the current crisis is the “final verdict on eight years of bad economic policy created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain.”
The Illinois senator has reaffirmed that despite the fluctuations in the stock market, he will be able to reduce the tax burden on 95% of Americans. He added that his primary goals include the possible creation of the country’s energy independence through the use of renewable energy sources, as well as the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
However, both presidential candidates cautiously avoided questions about the $700 billion (470 billion euros) bank rescue plan, a highly unpopular plan passed by Congress last night.
Minsk: "Did you notice that there was an election here?"
On Sunday evening, young people and members of the opposition demonstrated in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the expected results of the parliamentary elections.
On Sunday evening, after the polling stations were closed, hundreds of Belarusians gathered in the main square of Minsk to protest against the falsification of the election results.
Although the results have not yet been published, a number of young people have protested against President Alexander Lukashenko with the words: 'Mr Dictator, resign'.
Some people admit that they didn’t even go to the polls: “Why would I go? They can do whatever they want with my vote anyway!” says one young person.
The protesters do not believe that the regime, which has tried to present itself to foreign observers in order to establish relations with the European Union, is ready for a democratic change of regime.
If the elections were judged to be clean by observers, they could lift sanctions against the country, which denied visas to 40 Belarusian leaders and froze some bank accounts.
According to the opposition, the elections were not conducted purely.
“We were kept away from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to take part in the vote count,” lamented Yuri Potemkin, a spokesman for the United Democratic Forces coalition, which is composed of twelve parties and is thus very heterogeneous.
"The changes were only nominal," stresses Alexander Milinkievich, the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement. "The main thing is who counts the votes, and in our case it is the executive power.
If the opposition delegates get into parliament, it means that they have been appointed, not elected.
But their access to parliament allows them to get a seat on television, meet in the regions of the country and submit legislative proposals.
The opposition must therefore take the stage in political life, because “dialogue with the European Union must be initiated”.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis and we are unable to renew itself, we run the risk of falling under Russia’s control.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitors the electoral process, will accept the results of the vote as valid.
They stress that the turnout seems too high, and the widespread organisation of advance voting (in which 26% of voters in Minsk participated) has allowed for any manipulation.
“Did you notice that an election was taking place here?” asks Social Democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, who was the last person to be released from prison in August this year as a political prisoner.
No one was present in the polling stations.
There will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in the parliament, and they will be the ones best suited to the leadership.
The silence of the night falls again on October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission are cheering.
The blood is safe again.
Yesterday, Héma-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of its foundation. President Francine Décary had good reason to celebrate, because Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood donation companies in the world.
And most importantly, he managed to regain people’s trust, which was severely shaken by the tainted blood scandal of the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood supply treated by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Service was infected with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
In February 1994, the Canadian government, led by Judge Horace Krever, launched a formal investigation into the drama and the general outcry to shed light on the circumstances that led to the tragedy and to make recommendations to avoid similar incidents in the future.
While Judge Krever delayed submitting his report, some provinces set up their own committees aimed at designing a new blood-treatment system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Commission was responsible for this task.
The Gélineau and Krever reports led to the creation of two blood services in Canada: the Hema-Québec blood service for Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Association for all other provinces and territories.
“When Héma-Québec started in 1998, only 38% of the population had confidence in Quebec’s blood supply system,” recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was desperate.
"In the following years, however, as a result of improving the safety of blood products and our work in the field, we managed to regain the trust of the people." Décary proudly states that at the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the Quebec population considered Héma-Québec to be reliable.
But Dr. Décary does not forget that “trust is a very fragile thing.”
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the principle of prudence.
During this period, several cases of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, have been discovered in Europe, says the doctor, who has been managing the company since its foundation in 1998.
"We had no idea that this disease was transmitted by blood.
Therefore, we relied on one of the most important recommendations of the Krever and Gelineau reports. According to this, if we are uncertain about this and there is a risk of developing a serious disease, then we should apply exclusionary measures. In this case, it was Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which causes a change in the brain, so inevitably leads to death.
Therefore, in April 1999, we did not accept blood from persons who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was established beyond all doubt that the disease was transmitted by blood.
This case convinced us that it made sense to apply the principle of prudence.”
In 1999, a technique appeared on the market that allows a more sensitive diagnosis of HIV. This is the nucleic acid test (NAT), which is able to directly detect the virus itself in the blood of blood donors, and not the antibodies against the virus, on which previously used tests were built.
With the help of the NAT test, we were able to shorten the window period, which lasts from infection until we can detect the virus in the blood with the help of our technical tools, the specialist explains.
This period could be reduced to less than one week.
Thus, the risk of unknowingly infecting the blood was significantly reduced, as well as the risk of undetectable infection by blood donors.
These improvements have greatly reduced the risk of transmission of AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, the risk of getting HIV-infected blood is 12 million to one.
“In other words, we would have to distribute 12 million blood products until someone is infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Québec dispenses between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it would take more than 24 years for such a case to occur and for someone to become infected with HIV through a blood product.
I think that today anyone can safely accept or prescribe a blood transfusion in order to restore health, says the number one leader of Hema-Québec.
“The challenge for the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
You never know what new pathogens are going to enter the system.
It was only last year that the chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, enters the blood through insect bites.
Therefore, we have to be constantly on guard," continued Dr. Décary, then emphasized that in addition to emergency reserves, Hema-Québec must provide sufficient permanent reserves.
With the ageing of the population, the needs are also increasing.
Because anticancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need to replace red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has an impact on the stock of blood donors, as the number of people in the network who are able to donate blood is only 3% of the Quebec population.
However, every healthy person, at least 18 years of age, who meets the eligibility criteria, can give blood every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of applicants do not accept blood because they are infected with, for example, AIDS or malaria, and those who have been to a country where malaria is spreading are not eligible to donate blood for a year.
“With this 3%, we have enough reserves to meet the needs of hospitals.
It's very rare for us to run out of supplies.
However, the number of blood donors should be increased as the existing ones age, because after a while they can no longer give blood.
But it is very difficult to persuade people to give blood, but it is even more difficult to keep them and persuade them to become regular blood donors.
In today’s fast-paced world, you don’t have an hour to go and give blood.” – Francine Décary
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec supplies not only blood products but also human tissues, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin, which are used almost exclusively for severely burned people.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed, and frozen, and then placed at Hema-Québec, which also treats Québec’s only public stem cell bank.
The umbilical cord, once treated only as medical waste, produces blood that is rich in stem cells, making it possible to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago we celebrated the arrival of the 1,000th umbilical cord blood sample in our bank, and we plan to collect more than 1,000 new samples each year.
We will probably start offering them for organ transplants early next year,” said Décary, who said the cord blood removal program is very popular today.
“Many mothers are saddened that this is not possible” – indeed, it is because Hema-Québec is not in a position to make this complex and costly program available in every hospital in Quebec.
Football - Impact in the semi-final
The Montreal Impact team defeated the Seattle Sounders 3:1 yesterday in the USL-1 qualifiers and reached the semifinals with a combined 4:3 result. This was the second match of the quarter-final and crucial for the overall results, which took place at the Saputo Stadium.
The final goal was scored by midfielder Antonio Ribeiro in the 90th minute of the match.
While the first half passed without a goal, in the second half the Montreal team's two midfielders, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, also found themselves in the opponent's net.
Roger Levesque was the only Sounders player to outsmart Matt Jordan.
Recall that in its first match on Friday, Impact was defeated 2:1 by the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
Impact will play in the semifinals with Vancouver Whitecaps.
In Minnesota on Saturday night, Thunder, who lost 3–1 to Whitecaps in the first match, won 4:3, but Whitecaps reached the semifinals with a 5:4 overall.
Impact are scheduled to meet Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the matches will be clarified today.
In a nutshell - Kovalev's winning goal
The Canadiens' favorite triad is ready for another season.
The trio of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led great attacks, and in the end the Canadiens won against the Florida Panthers in a 3:2 penalty shootout last night at the Centre Bell.
Kostitsyn, the number one star of the match, scored a goal. Plekanec finished the match with two goals and Kovalev with one goal pass, which was the fourth victory of the team's six preparation matches.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who scored the only goal of the shootout.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian player warns.
“I need another game to feel good.”
“He tried too hard in the first trimester,” said Guy Carbonneau.
“But I think he was happy with the final result of the game.
It was a huge ovation.”
Charest North 's
The Prime Minister does not rule out that the election will begin this year
Just as the Liberal Party's meeting was over, Jean Charest was yesterday travelling to the Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left) is trying to win the by-election today.
"To push back our last great northern border": this is the ambitious long-term goal that Jean Charest set at yesterday's meeting of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Lévis. The speech was enriched with visual elements, but at the same time the President tried to focus on the essence.
During his presentation, behind his back, a series of images similar to "Moulin <0xC3><0xA0> images" were projected.
The three giant projectors were followed by stunning images: hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec on "Google Maps", maps...
Such spectacular tools are usually used during election periods.
At the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to guarantee that the election will not begin this autumn, although he added that his schedule is very tight.
The “Northern Plan” is the fourth pillar of the Prime Minister’s “vision” for the future of Quebec, embodied in a “new economic area” that includes a labor agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and a series of agreements with Ontario.
Lately, the opening towards the North (i.e. the northern area starting at 49 degrees latitude) has often been mentioned in the Prime Minister’s speeches, but he has never given a lecture on this topic.
The head of state, however, merely explained why he considered the North to be a “treasure mine full of great opportunities”. He did not, however, speak about the time factor, investment amounts, or specific priorities for future projects.
It highlighted only a few opportunities for development, mainly hydropower, forestry and, in particular, mining, which are further stimulated by the growth of emerging countries and the rebuilding of public infrastructure.
In the north, there are "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds," Charest said.
This area, which is "twice the size of France", "is our territory, the territory of Quebec.
It is found not only in us, but in us," the head of state repeated, stressing that this is intended to create a national founding myth.
He pointed out that Quebec’s development was largely determined by its relationship with the North: the gold rush in Abitibi, the design work in Quebec, the James Bay...
"This is ours, our future!" he added, after taking a theatrical pause and looking at the huge map behind him.
The North, which covers 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister said at a press conference.
“This is our historic position, which has been confirmed by all governments.
There is a line on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and when the time comes, I reaffirm the same resolution on behalf of the government."
On the other hand, “in the light of climate change, we need to rethink our view of the North”, the Prime Minister said, speaking about the Northwest Passage, which opens every year due to the melting of the Arctic ice.
In the Prime Minister’s opinion, in this new geopolitical environment, the occupation of the area is an important task.
And what about the natives of the area, the Indians and the Eskimos?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec is paying special attention to them and that the plan will bring many benefits, especially for young people.
The two ministers of the different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (the latter was a delegate of the Parti Québécois from Hungary), have already started consultations with about thirty local communities.
The Interministerial Commission chaired by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Minister for Transport and Natural Resources) plays an important role, has also become operational.
The Prime Minister does not exclude the possibility of a large-scale meeting, “not necessarily a summit”, where “a common vision is created”.
The development of the North would otherwise be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be coordinated, organised and at the same time environmentally friendly,” the Prime Minister promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in line with the ideas of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
“Like previous liberals, we think differently: our goal is to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend that began with the big cocktail party celebrating the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s election as party leader on Friday.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes that the Beauharnois power plant be renamed the Adélard-Godbout dam.
“The politicians of our party, including Godbout, the founder of Hydro-Québec, Lesage, who implemented the silent revolution and the national expansion of hydroelectric power plants, or Bourassa, known as the father of James Bay, all knew how to forge the future,” Jean Charest said.
At the press conference, he also quoted another – albeit conservative – work, namely John Diefenbaker’s “Roads to the North” by the Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the plan for the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam, President Charest pointed out that the commissioning is planned for 2012.
“Let this be between us, but I plan to be there,” he told his followers, and his statement was met with a loud applause.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a vote to be held this autumn, which is also permitted by law.
However, he stressed that his calendar is already full, as he undertook tasks at the meeting of the Federal Council in China and at the Quebec-New York summit.
The party meeting held at the end of the week proved to be an excellent platform for the liberal president to explain the nationalist resolutions, which were approved almost without hesitation. Here it is mainly about "constitutional aspirations": the liberal party demands, in particular, recognition of the "specific character" of Quebec in the Constitution.
They also want Quebec to be able to appoint members of Canada’s Radio and Telecommunications Council, and for these members to have veto power over decisions made in Quebec.
The opposition, however, was skeptical of the main points of the Northern Plan.
The leader of the Parti Québécois, Paulina Marois, once again raised the issue of the development policy for northern Quebec, which was introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to Marois, the liberal government that came to power in 2003 refused to apply this policy.
If they had not done so, "we would be much ahead of the game today", said Marois, in agreement with Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure, who was nominated as a candidate in today's Jean-Talon vote.
The opposition party ADQ supports the government’s approval of the Nordic Plan.
“But we want it to be more than a charade,” said party leader Sébastien Proulx, who replaced Mario Dumont, who returned from his freedom today.
Letters - A Disgraced Country
Vic Toews, the Harper cabinet minister (and by the way, his “justice minister”), had the courage last summer to call Louise Arbour “the shame” of Canada.
So to insult a woman who has fought unceasingly for the truth and deserves all our admiration - that says a lot about the people around the Prime Minister and about Stephen Harper himself.
So this is our government, which, among all the Western countries concerned, has not brought home its own citizens from the Guantánamo concentration camp alone.
This is the government that absolutely ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was still a teenager at the time of the crimes he was accused of.
It is the only government that, despite Canada’s signature of the Geneva Convention, has refused to do so and has allowed a child soldier to suffer inhumane conditions.
The only government to turn justice into a puppet show while investigating the guilt of a defendant.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Lawyers' Association are also calling for Omar Khadr's repatriation so that he can be given a fair trial in Canada.
Our government turns a blind eye to torture: it does not matter to it that a young adult has already been psychologically destroyed, and the many years of torture have probably sealed his fate for life.
Although we are not yet aware of this, at the moment we are witnessing the insidious destruction of our rights, our freedom and our democracy. "Democracy": Harper unceasingly utters this word, which from his mouth sounds like an empty phrase.
The time has come, then, when morality no longer exists: any Canadian citizen can be arbitrarily beaten, tortured and imprisoned at the behest of a leader of a government that has been in the minority until now (and what comes after October 14...?).
Many electors believe that they can find salvation in a party that glorifies virtue, law and order; they do not see that this government tramples underfoot the values to which our country owes its good name and dignity.
My dear Mr. Toews, the shame is this - don't look anywhere else.
The Orwellian Oratory of Barrick Gold
In the September 17 issue of Le Devoir, a letter was published from Patrick J. Garver, Deputy President and CEO of Barrick Gold Mine in Canada.
Garver claims that the world’s largest gold producer has filed a $6 million defamation suit against three authors and a small-money publishing company in an effort to initiate a so-called “public debate.”
Although judges are independent and impartial, their decisions, especially in defamation cases, are made not on the basis of the truth, but on the basis of the law.
Not surprisingly, Garver remained deeply silent about this fundamental difference.
Would the best way for Barrick Gold to have a public debate really be to destroy anyone whose point of view is contrary to his?
Regardless of the outcome of the lawsuit, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada must spend considerable amounts of money on defense and struggle in an unequal struggle with an army of lawyers backed by the almost inexhaustible resources of the mining industry on the other side.
In such an unequal struggle, moreover, the tactic of ruining the defendant and making a friendly agreement is often employed, which not only silences the opposite, but also intimidates those who would try to deal with the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it should have spoken to the public.
While in many other countries where Barrick Gold operates, this is not the case, in Canada the parties to the dispute usually do not strike each other with a stick, but tell their thoughts.
The mine would therefore have had to open its books and dossiers and prepare for a real debate in the press, media and publications, paying independent research groups that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn’t seem to trust the public and sweeps aside petitions and letters written to protect Noir Canada’s copyright.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he can start a 'public' debate while ignoring the opinion of this public?
In the mind of the vice president, this word probably means only the well-paid lawyers, not the entire population of Canada: the meaning of the term is narrowed down.
In a democratic state, even those who denigrate others are entitled to freedom of speech.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that Noir Canada's authors and publishers are supported by the public, above all, because it condemns the mine's harsh practices.
The public is willing to listen to Barrick and form a verdict, but it would do so on the basis of civilized arguments rather than through a lawsuit aimed at silencing many. (By the way, in connection with the term "public debate", Barrick Gold recently called on the authors of Noir Canada in writing to refrain from using this term.)
In addition to Garver’s surrealistic expositions, Barrick Gold’s approach is an open attack on the freedom of academic research and the search for truth, which are the building blocks of any democratic society.
On the whole, the procedure denies the right to cite authentic sources, as well as the right to debate the facts and their interpretation, which form the basis of intellectual activities.
If, in a country like Canada, it is only possible to study and discuss issues that do not please the rich companies of today’s world, under the weight of litigation, who will have the courage to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wants an open and transparent debate, it could do so according to the scientific standards applied by Noir Canada’s authors.
You have the right to answer.
In our university circle, we have long been able to handle disputes, disagreements and conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s ill-advised approach shows that, contrary to his assertion, he has no desire to engage in open debate.
This represents a loss for both the university world and the institution of public debate in Canada. It is time for governments to finally put in place measures to limit legal proceedings launched with the aim of such abuse.
Wall Street Rescue: Republicans and Democrats Agree
Yesterday, the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Bush administration and Congress finally reached an agreement on the economic bailout, the largest such plan since the Great Depression.
The $700 billion plan, which aims to stem the financial crisis that has been raging on Wall Street for months, still needs to be approved by the two Houses of Congress.
The key elements of the plan are: more effective monitoring of implementation by Members; new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the earmarked public funds; new provisions to keep the number of houses seized due to non-payment; the right of access to the salaries of directors of companies receiving assistance.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Judd Gregg announced the good news a few minutes before midnight yesterday after the two-day marathon session ended.
“We are making great progress toward a solution that will work effectively in the markets,” Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson said in a statement.
“We’ve done everything we can to save the real economy and save American citizens from the current Wall Street crisis,” he said.
“The bottom line is that if we don’t do this, there will be a tremendous amount of shock, chaos and turmoil in Americans’ daily lives,” said Republican Rep. Judd Gregg.
The negotiations were accelerated in the last few hours for fear that another failure would have a detrimental effect on investor sentiment.
They gave themselves a deadline for the deal to open this morning.
The two presidential candidates who joined the negotiations late showed willingness to reach an agreement, but they expressed their disapproval of the fact that the situation has escalated to the end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has ascribed to himself the extension of the agreement with elements such as provisions related to the preservation of home ownership or the payment of directors of state-sponsored companies.
“When we ask taxpayers to take some extraordinary action because of other people’s irresponsibility, that’s not very welcome.
These steps are necessary,” he said in a televised interview.
And when his opponent, John McCain, was asked by another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, he replied, “I’d like to know the details, but I hope so.”
“From what I’ve read in broad outlines, it’s clear that this is something we all need to digest and move forward with.
The possibility of doing nothing is simply unacceptable,” he said.
Under the $700 billion plan, taxpayers' money would be used to buy the dubious claims of U.S. financial institutions and some risky, non-sellable assets.
The plan was preceded by a 14-month crisis triggered by the bursting of the real estate bubble, which led first to the collapse of risky real estate loans (secondary mortgages), then to the spread of other debt (commercial) securities, and finally to the freezing of liquid resources and the commotion of banks and financial institutions.
The first draft deal was struck by a group of Republican MPs last week.
We seem to have managed to get out of this dead end since the Democrats agreed that certain “toxic” assets of companies in difficulty should be secured by the government rather than bought up.
To satisfy all members of Congress, the plan also includes a provision that if the government has to bear losses under the program for five years, it can impose new taxes to recover its funds.
As part of the new plan, a $250 billion tranche would be paid first; a further $100 billion could follow if the president deems it necessary.
The remaining $350 billion would need to be approved by Congress.
In exchange for the aid, Washington acquires a stake in the subsidised companies, through which it receives dividends from the profits, which it can sell after the crisis has passed.
The federal government will have the possibility to delay the seizure of real estate to cover the mortgage loans covered by the plan. In addition, it can set the maximum value of wages and severance payments that can be paid to the managers of companies affected by the crisis.
The plan is expected to be approved by the House of Representatives today and by the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite their efforts, however, it is still not certain that the plan will be approved.
Yesterday, there were repeated objections to the plan among both Republicans and Democrats.
"It is absolutely clear that Washington is not hearing your voice," Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told voters.
“We have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is nothing that will benefit the taxpayers.”
Brad Sherman, the Democratic leader of a small congressional group called the “skeptic faction,” presents things differently, but he comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred distinguished economists, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written to us asking Congress not to hurry and to look carefully at which path to take,” Sherman said.
At the same moment in Europe, it was again understood that this was a global crisis.
Following a crisis conference, the three Benelux states announced that they would nationalise part of the Fortis banking group for €11.2 billion (US$16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French BNP Paribas announced that it would not buy its near-bankruptcy competitor, after losing EUR 2 million (USD 2.9 billion) as a result of the crisis of secondary mortgages in the United States.
With 85,000 employees, Fortis is one of the 20 largest European banks and one of the 10 largest insurance companies.
"It's not wasted money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said.
"In return, we will gain the right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what depositors and households appreciate now that the situation promises to be precarious.”
Meanwhile, across the English Channel, the British government seems to be about to nationalize another bank that has been swept away by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all ongoing loans from Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which real estate loans amount to <0xC2><0xA3>41 billion (US$75.5 billion).
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will acquire the subsidiaries and customer base of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock to be nationalised by the British government since the start of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Farewell to the Idol of the Actors
His beautiful azure eyes were considered by some to be his main trump card, by others to be his main weakness.
Has the American actor ever gotten rid of his daffodil mirror?
Yes and no.
Because of his shyness, sensitivity and innate talent, he was also far from the loud style that is the essence of the true great monsters of the art world.
But what a huge course it has run!
Paul Newman, 83, died of lung cancer on Friday at his Connecticut estate, one of the last icons of the heyday of American cinema.
He was less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled, and who had long been his rival on the screen. In his role, he was more restrained and undoubtedly more vulnerable, but he also advocated freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
From the mixing of blood, often extraordinary children are born.
Newman was born in 1925 in Ohio to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
European roots contributed to the birth of one of the symbolic figures of the American dream.
He did not think much of himself, which only increased his merits.
In the early 1950s, he studied drama at Yale University, then at Actor's Studio in New York City, before he exploded into the world of theatre, television, and shortly thereafter into the world of cinema.
In addition to being a champion of civil rights, he also finished second in the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans as a racing driver, and was considered a sex symbol, although he had been happily married to actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
We shall never know what the dark sides of this mysterious, aloof, devoted actor, who hated the glamour of show business, have been, and will always remain, a mystery.
He was an honest man in the best sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman at the end of the week has shocked movie fans: we can only see him in his big roles on the black screen of memories.
Looking through his oeuvre, we can see the seventh American art: cinema has been constantly changing for more than fifty years.
We remember the charming cowboy "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) and the estranged young man from his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor), in the role of whom we saw the Tennessee Williams cover of "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" in 1958.
In recent times (1990), we can remember him as the sensitive Mr. Bridge, who is faced with the fact that his marriage has not lived up to his expectations.
Paul Newman has seen many other faces in his films.
In Robert Wise's "Someone Upstairs", he played the turbulent criminal-boxer Rocky Graziano, the role that started Newman's acting career in 1956, originally intended for James Dean and taken over after his death.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in the brilliant film "The Great Controversy", which won an Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
In Robert Rossen's brilliant 1961 film The Swindler, he played a bitter, vengeful billiard player, and returned in a similar role in Martin Scorsese's 1987 film The Color of Money, for which he received his only Oscar nomination in nine nominations.
Times are changing, but it's always the same face: that's who he was.
He's always been like that.
The period of his career was marked by periods of change.
He is best known for his role as Reggie Dunlop, an unconventional ice hockey coach, in George Roy Hill's 1977 cult film The Icebreakers.
His fans saw him in the 1994 Coen Brothers' "The Great Leap Forward."
Sam Mendes' 2003 film, Path of Perdition, was his last appearance as an Irish mob boss.
Unlike many movie legends who left the screen relatively soon, Newman remained in the spotlight for a long time, although he condemned Hollywood for its glamour, luxury, and hypocrisy.
French film director Bertrand Tavernier did not without humor view it as a "living rebuttal of underplaying": he thought his play was too powerful.
The profession, however, was not always kind to the handsome Paul Newman, who for a long time just fell into the lap of the film roles.
However, he played young and successful characters less often: rather, he played figures living on the fringes of society - neurotic, alcoholic, malignant or hopeless - whose drift and rebellion he was able to reproduce with perfect authenticity.
As a director, Newman showed a lesser-known face: a truly modest and sensitive man deep down in his soul.
In the 1968 film "Rachel, Rachel" (an adaptation of the novel by Canadian author Margaret Laurence), he and his wife Joanne Woodward starred in a delicate portrait of a melancholy woman.
In the 1984 film "Harry and His Son", he pays tribute to his son, Scott, who died of a drug overdose.
Yesterday, Newman was remembered by countless admirers, and his close friend and longtime comrade-in-arms, Robert Redford (with whom they played together in "The Great Controversy" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid") lamented, "His presence has made my life and the world a better place.
Generosity and the joy of being: that was the secret to the vibrant personality of this great actor that we have now lost.
Alongside his legendary career, he blurs his focus on civil rights, the environment, independent filmmaking, and criticism of Hollywood's excesses.
Many times we could see his picture smiling on the packaging of sauces, sauces, biscuits and other foods. He did it with a rather bad taste in his mouth, although in the beginning he thought it was funny.
However, the proceeds from such sales have always been transferred to his foundation for children with the disease.
Newman never rested on his laurels: he remained committed to the profession throughout.
In a letter to her five daughters, she wrote: "Your father was and has always been incredibly grateful for his star of fortune.
It was a privilege to be here.”
It is also a privilege for us to follow the career of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
He was a model citizen, above all.
What was produced at Zuschlag & Tsai’s invoice factory?
Soon, on October 8, the trial of János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
The politician and his associates are accused of fraud and other crimes, including forgery of documents, that have caused particularly significant damage, and that have been committed in a criminal organization on a continuous and commercial basis.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the tender funds were used for their own purposes, and the performance of tasks was often proven by false invoices.
The state and local government funds - in total about 65 million forints - migrated partly into the coffers of the Young Left and partly into the pockets of certain individuals.
The method described by the investigative authority was that the funds received were collected on the basis of cost accounts that were not backed by actual performance, and the associations never complied with the commitments they had made.
According to the indictment, most of the accounts were forged.
The bill blocks for these were purchased at the market in J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefváros, and the round stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And which companies are responsible for the production of invoices was decided, among other things, on the Balaton-felvidék boulevard, to which János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
According to the testimony of the latter, he had to look at bed-and-breakfasts and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption there, which was then modelled on the invoices to be submitted to the applications of the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour and the Municipality of Budapest.
These were mostly written by István Lados and his partner, András <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, wrote mostly the reports necessary for obtaining the grants.
One of the targets of Lados’s “study trip” was a beer house.
According to two invoices issued by the Zuschlags in 2003, the restaurant provided meals for a group of ninety members of the Sure Point Association.
However, according to the company manager, they would not have been able to get into the restaurant at the same time.
In the same way, the bill issued to the Foundation for a Better Future – later Together for the Third Millennium – in the summer of 2002 was riddled with errors of form and content.
A pension in Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it in one night, yet the bill was for one hundred and thirty guests.
However, the imaginative fillers of the forms were also overdone when they marked Pigal Kft., a company also engaged in catering, which, according to the information given to the prosecution, did not even have the documents concerning the Better Future and the name of the Opposite in its books.
The head of the company, Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, told hvg.hu that when he was called to the prosecutor’s office and showed him invoices, he immediately knew that they were false documents.
"The wrong place on the stamp was our business name and our tax number."
He added that, beyond the formal reasons, it did not make sense that according to the bill, 100 people were accommodated, as they have a total of eleven rooms that do not have as many seats.
In addition, the bill was for catering, while their restaurant had been out of operation for a long time.
The avid bill makers did not investigate the fact that the Budapest travel agency they looked for only organizes trips abroad, so they mistakenly marked travel to Hungary as a service on the cash payment account, which also did not match the company’s invoicing practices.
In addition, as the investigation revealed, VAT was also included in the document, even though the travel activity to countries outside the European Union was VAT-free.
Among other things, the rate of VAT was also wrong on the four documents issued by Hotel Révf<0xC3><0xBC>l<0xC3><0xB6>p Kft. for Better Future, because the service of the company is not subject to the 25 percent but 15 percent VAT indicated, in addition, the hotel employees issued only a machine invoice, but the manufactured invoice was manual.
In addition to this, the “exhibitors” also spoiled the invoice by marking the road transport of goods in the case of a company as an activity performed – it turned out through the prosecution procedure –, which the company originally based on investment advice did not carry out.
In addition, due to formal discrepancies - inadequate account format, not a real stamp - it was also revealed that the accounts for the Together for the Third Millennium Foundation, the Cultural Association of the 21st Century and the Sure Point are false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehért<0xC3><0xB3> Sports Camp, whose representatives denied that they issued the invoices.
For example, the forgers did not pay attention to the fact that the Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyháza HIB Kft. was under liquidation at the time (2001) when the group of the Young City Association was eating there, which is why the liquidator of the company – as far as we know – denied that he had issued the paper.
Consciously Presented
The other group of account issuers are those who were aware that they had to issue fictitious accounts.
The Chance for Budapest Foundation issued an invoice for the Together for the Third Millennium Foundation at the request of the Young Left - Young Socialists for about four million forints.
According to the indictment, one of the accused, Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rfi Ludovic convinced the head of Collab Kft. to issue the fictitious account.
He also cooperated with the Zuschlags at present under liquidation Biogate Kft., which in 2003 provided the Better Future Foundation, the Atlasz Association and the V<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>sfeny<0xC5><0x91> Association with roughly HUF 5 million worth of invoices, which were not backed by any real economic activity.
Neither did money, because the completed invoices were then towed, but the organizations had forgotten to include this in their documents.
The next group of companies issuing invoices are those that are linked to the accused.
Thus, the delivery agent of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3> Kft. dealing with fuel and motor vehicle trade, although not located in Budapest, was Iván Kubatov.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 for the sale of computer equipment worth approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the data of the investigation, these invoices were purchased by Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since September 14, 2005.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian man, to whom Iván Kubatov would also forward the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We understand that Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he issued an invoice to Atlasz, Hoppa and the Together for the Third Millennium Foundation on behalf of the company, and took their consideration.
Specifically, at the request of Iván Kubatov, Romanian masons founded the Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the companies actually operated, which the defendant claimed was due to the fact that they did not get a job.
However, it was useful for the companies, because at the request of Zsolt Szente, his accused partner, who also prepared the papers for the foundation of the company, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations related to Zuschlag: Atlasz and Y-Generation.
On behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave the organizations a total of 15 accounts worth HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecutor’s office said that 10 percent of the amounts indicated on the invoices and VAT hit Kubatov’s mark.
The man even used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, which were manufactured for the Sure Point tender.
In January 2006, Y-Generation and the Association for Modern Hungary submitted a tender to the public benefit organization of the Socialist Party, the Táncsics Mihály Foundation (TMA).
They won between 500 and 500 thousand forints, but the money was not used for the purposes indicated in the tender.
In order not to reveal this, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were submitted to TMA.
These bills were found during a search of <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei’s office at his educational portfolio.
At the trial, some of the defendants, as they did at the prosecutor’s office, are likely to report on the process of invoice production.
It may be most interesting if the prime defendant himself, János Zuschlag, decides to expose everything.
His testimony so far is not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to speak comprehensively, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in the best interest of the socialists to make a deal with him in return for paying the majority of the damage, fifty million forints, and Zusi will take the blame.
By the way, he may even have been offended by the fact that his requests to alleviate the circumstances of his detention, i.e. to place him under house arrest, were constantly falling on deaf ears.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes that cause much more damage and do not compensate for it are free to walk around, or at least to wait in their own homes for the proceedings against them to end, they are not allowed to do so.
The psychology of overbidding: why do we give out more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more money, overvalue the goods.
Neurological-economic foundations for this known—and seemingly irrational—behaviour have been explored by neurologists and economists at New York University.
According to a study published in the journal Science, people don’t want to be beaten in a type of competition like eBay’s auction, so they tend to pay too high a price.
The research tried to map the neural pattern of this "game" by means of experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers participated in a lottery and the other group participated in a player auction, while using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method to examine the subjects’ active brain regions.
In both games, the participants could win money, but during the auction game, in which an essential element is the overbidding of the other party, the striatum, a subcortical complex, was activated intensively when the game was lost.
This area of the brain, among other functions, plays a role in the "self-rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the surge in the price can be explained by avoiding a violent reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, the economists of the research group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In it, three groups bet against one partner under different circumstances.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was, and they placed their bets.
Another group was promised an additional $15 if they were to win the game.
The third group had just received $15 before the auction, but the members of the group also lost that money in the event of a losing auction.
The only difference between the two groups was that they emphasized winning for one group and losing for the other.
However, proving the neurologists' hypothesis, members of the team playing "against loss" were willing to bet higher than the control and "winning" groups.
“These results cannot be deduced from any pre-existing economic theory.
Until now, they have only explained the phenomena of the auction with the joy of winning and avoiding risks.
Neurological imaging alone has helped to resolve the conflict between these two theories by providing a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, a professor of economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor?
About half a billion people around the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and chronic liver disease is one of the leading causes of death in Hungary.
The number of people infected with hepatitis at home is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, the reason for which: patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the common name for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities in their symptoms, they are characterized by hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and the diseases they cause are different from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on the pathogen, are transmitted in two main forms: hepatitis A and E through the gastrointestinal tract (for example, with infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (vomit, vaginal discharge, saliva).
Travellers should definitely protect themselves against A and B viruses, there is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating an infected food, generally accompanied by malaise, weakness, abdominal discomfort, nausea.
After that, the yellowness visible on the skin and the whites of the eyes develops, the stool is light, the urine becomes dark, the healing can take two to three weeks.
Worldwide, one million people die each year from a more serious form of the disease, hepatitis B liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected people receive medication.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, because the pathogen insidiously destroys the cells of the liver, in many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20-30 years.
Thus, it is very important to carry out early prevention and regular screening tests.
Three groups have significantly higher than average rates of this disease: people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users, and people with tattoos.
There are currently 200 million people worldwide infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory test, it is advisable to consult your GP if you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
When recognized in time, the disease can be cured, the virus can be eliminated from the body, thus, the infectivity ceases and the development of cancer can be prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first celebrated in 2004 by organizations representing patients around the world.
Its aim is to draw attention to the chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Does anyone who believes in God feel any less pain?
According to a recent study, religious faith acts as a painkiller that may have eased the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment to investigate how belief in God affects people’s perception of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
The study involved electroshocking 12 Catholics and an equal number of atheists, all studying a painting of the Virgin Mary.
The results showed that Catholics were able to rule out much of the pain.
Thanks to the technology that scans the human brain, Catholics have also been able to activate the part of the brain responsible for controlling pain.
The study is the first in a series of studies involving academics, as well as scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university.
The study was conducted by attaching a sparking device to the subject’s left hand, which provided the electroshock.
The researchers asked the participants to look closely at two paintings, the 17th-century Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato and the 15th-century Lady with Hermeline painted by Leonardo da Vinci.
The authors of the study hoped that the spectacle of the Virgin Mary would bring about a religious state among the believers, while the da Vinci image was chosen because it was not too different from the others and was thought to have a calming effect.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner machine, receiving 20 electroshocks in four consecutive parts while either looking at the religious theme or the general picture.
Catholics reported that when they saw the Virgin Mary, they felt "safe" as if they were "taken care of" and "calm down, they were at peace."
When they looked at the religious-themed picture, they reported 12 percent less pain than when they saw Leonardo’s work in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself was involved in the study, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any powerful image, even for atheists, you just need to find the right photo.
“We should find an image that they feel very positively about, like a mother or a father,” he said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the findings.
“The practice of faith should and in many cases will change our personality,” Wright added.
After the excellent results, the only question is: if Leonardo or a similar-calibre painter is shown a picture of one of the Madonnas to the faithful, what effect would it have on their pain control?
Would seeing the quality of the Virgin Mary mean even better results?
You are what you share about yourself
On his tenth birthday, Google can tell you: it can be found in people’s pockets at least as much as above their heads in the sky; he knows where they vacationed, what specialist appointments they attend and what they are interested in.
And that's still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's top people.
As for the skeptics who draw parallels with the Orwellian nightmare, they don’t see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to collect more personal information about its users, which is necessary to keep up with the original goal of the founders of Google, which was “to gather all the information in the world.”
According to the CEO of Google, after ten years of world subversion, the company is still at the beginning of being able to handle all the information.
Asked what will happen in five years, Schmidt said he wanted Google to answer questions such as “what should I do tomorrow?” and “what kind of work would really suit me?” – but until then, software can’t answer such simple questions because it doesn’t know enough about its users.
Not all Internet users are aware of the fact that during internet searches, the search words are recorded exactly, from which IP address they searched and to which page the visitors left after the search.
For example, Personalized Search, launched two years ago, allows users to store their own surfing history, look back at what they were looking for, what they clicked on, and in the long run it will generate much more personalized results for them - the same logic will be used in Recommendations, with which the system will offer us products and services based on our previously stated and recorded preferences.
What if they use my data against me if they look at what I do?, users who are worried about seeing Google’s data monopoly ask.
In most cases, the potential power represented by the company can be daunting, not the guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom, or even rebellion against power that triggers counter-reactions among Internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all searched terms are not only recorded, but in justified cases they can also be passed on to third parties, in such cases the privacy rights of internet users are not protected.
Perhaps the loudest example of this in recent times was the coordinated action against pedophiles in Brazil, in which Google provided the Brazilian government with information about pedophiles from the social network Orkut, which it maintains.
Internet users concerned about privacy rights, however, may have sighed in May when the company, along with the EFF, successfully proved its case in court against the FBI: according to which Google cannot be forced to disclose any information secretly requested by the FBI by any point in the Constitution in the future.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully fought off some 50,000 web addresses and thousands of search terms, which it has obtained by citing the ratification of the Child Protection Act passed years earlier, but it has not managed to obtain the individual user search lists and the full two-month list of websites and keywords.)
Google’s judgment is rather contradictory: it is scolded by those who are afraid to give their personal data away because they feel that their intimate sphere and privacy are being eroded by the fact that they are starting to use Google’s services and are rebelling against them in a way that is worthy of the multinationals that shine in a conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its raucous network of computer enthusiasts, activists, and users in many countries see them as the next generation of big companies, the “cool corporation,” unlike its rival, Microsoft, which is considered a conqueror of the world because of Windows, no matter how hard they both struggle for the same goal.
This may be because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not charge its users for identification codes, it does not charge for its applications, and the open, free, constantly updated source code and software package seems to be much more accessible, younger and cooler than the official software giant’s practices.
However, it can also happen because geeks have a clear understanding of the very problematic relationship between personality rights and the Internet, which has been brought about by one of the most frequently cited keywords of recent years, web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is all about collaboration, about deliberately leaving clues behind and taking advantage of the communication channels available to us, and while these vary from person to person, the point is the same: we show ourselves.
An average young person can also manage profiles on multiple social media sites, from Facebook to Xanga, connect them to other services such as Twitter or last.fm, which lists their musical habits, and connect them all to tracking systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and they can also manage a blog on which their latest photo galleries are automatically displayed on Facebook or Flickr.
While we can read about several exemplary cases that shed light on it: a girlfriend can easily find out from the morning photo stream of a group of friends that a fraudulent friend spent the evening with, or she can fire an employee of a company just because she writes her honest opinion about the top management in her blog: one thing is for sure, the concept of privacy has been completely re-evaluated by now.
Those who live online are made up of what they show themselves to be able to formulate the basic tenets behind the behavior of today’s young people.
Anyone who wants to hide something, or at least avoid the Google monopoly, can do so (starting with Scroogle, which uses Google’s search system, but leaves no trace at the same time).
For example, the number of people who deliberately choose not to sign up for social networking sites so that they cannot be found can be replaced by alternative versions of Google’s online applications, from word processor to image manager and newsreader, which are not tied to huge server parks and do not make us the best profile ever.
The public is not so secretly waiting for Google to reveal its teeth.
With a current value of $156 billion, the company is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising platforms are threatening the revenue of advertising agencies, and the ever-accelerating introduction of services is causing serious headaches not only for Microsoft, but also for many other software developers.
Critics, however, also find counterpoints that may seem disturbing: for example, the top management completely rejected the protest of the employees after doubling the fee of the company kindergarten, the company management found too expensive to feed the employees multiple times a day for the Chinese company, but according to the Chinese, all of this is dwarfed by the fact that Google was still in charge of the Chinese government in 2006.
One of the company’s internal rules is that they don’t announce a new service in advance, only when it is ready for use, but it is certain that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years may move the world to a new point: while some believe that our previous Google book and magazine scanning and archiving project with our health care profile has taken on such a scale that the company will soon have to face the US Supreme Court’s system of Health.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database could be good material for the next generation of sci-fi writers, and the popular Cory Doctorow short story Scroogled dot Orwellian overtones describe a future in which a person can only be approached alarmingly well from Google’s data.
Two juveniles helped <0xC3><0x93>zd’s double murderer in the search for clues
Two juveniles were questioned by the police in the case of the double murder in <0xC3><0x93>zd, and there are reasonable suspicions that they helped to cover the traces of the crime, the spokesman of the Borsod County Police Headquarters said on Tuesday.
The young people have admitted to the charge and are currently being charged with complicity.
The two juveniles – two girls, according to MTI’s information – are free to defend themselves.
Prosecution may be punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment.
The suspect in the double murder in <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
He's being charged with premeditated, profiteering, multiple homicide.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old man owed a larger sum to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt, so last Wednesday he lured his creditor to a site in <0xC3><0x93>zd, where he killed him and his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the young man was preparing to commit the crime in advance, which is also indicated by the fact that he committed the murder with a concealed weapon at the scene.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are investigated by the police with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros – about five billion Czech crowns – for the purchase of a 100% share package on the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer, which was made by the Poles despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange had previously been excluded by the Czechs from the list of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in state hands.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which intends to sell more than 60% of the shares within a few months.
The Czech economic daily E15 knows that the offer of the Poles represents the highest amount ever offered by those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche B<0xC3><0xB6>rse have submitted bids so far.
Petr Koblic, chief of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner, and did not rule out that this could lead to the termination of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at between 5 and 10 billion kroner.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, about 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The largest shareholder of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance with a 25 percent share, followed by Ceská Sporitelna bank with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments on Tuesday on the deepening international financial crisis, leading European newspapers are already talking about “the second September 11”.
The global financial catastrophe is due to the US president, accused Rome’s La Repubblica, who has not even been able to rally his own party behind a hastily concocted bill aimed at remedying the desperate situation.
Instead of another Pearl Harbor, mentioned by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to talk about a second September 11.
A part of the Madrid press sees Washington as the scapegoat.
In El Mundo’s view, the lack of political leadership there has put the world economy on the brink of collapse.
The threat of collapse of the American financial system is growing, and the whole world will suffer.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, but with the Congressional vote, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger points out.
Some states today can provide a lifeline for failing financial institutions and use taxpayers’ money to save them from bankruptcy.
But if even more banks collapse like dominoes, neither the funds nor further improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union need to overcome their national egotism and centralise control over fragmented financial markets.
The ailing financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros on Monday alone, according to Vienna’s Der Standard, according to which concerns that European taxpayers, like Americans, will have to dig deep into their pockets to remedy the crisis are becoming more and more realistic.
So far, the EU has not seriously addressed the crisis, which is sweeping the old continent like a tsunami.
The "rescuers" do not have to rush hundreds of billions of euros, but it would be good if they could fix when it makes sense to use taxpayers' money to prevent more damage.
The Bumblebee's Flight Is Imitated by the Intelligent Car
What would be the best way to develop technologies to avoid collisions, if not to imitate the barrier sensors that occur in the world of nature?
The bees, for example.
In a surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, bumblebees provided Nissan engineers with the strategic starting point for building the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C bio-inspired auto-robot control system, a robotic mini-car with bee features, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that eliminates all collisions.
During the flight, each bee forms its own oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our safety protective shell, explained Kazuhhiro Doi, technology PR and R&D brand manager at the exhibition.
An important role is played by the complex eye of the uterus, which can see at a viewing angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions.
To replicate the function of the complex eye, the engineers used the idea of a laser rangefinder.
This detects obstacles within 2 meters in a 180-degree field of view ahead of the BR23C, calculates their distance, and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which is immediately converted into a collision avoidance operation.
In a fraction of a second, the obstacle is detected, and then the autobot changes direction immediately, imitating the movements of the bee, by turning its wheels as much as necessary to avoid a collision.
Unlike any current system, this avoidance maneuver is completely instinctive.
“If this were not the case, the auto-robot would not be able to react fast enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the auto-robot project.
You need to react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the safety shield, a layer within which collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process has to reflect what a bee does in order to avoid other bees.
This process must take place in the blink of an eye.
But unlike bees, the deviation cannot be directed upwards, downwards, or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the rotation of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the endless possibilities available to bees to avoid other bees, only rotational motion and acceleration, as well as deceleration, were used here as the option available to the autobot.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means they have a longer life than the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, the instinctive intelligent response is important, not the ability to process data, much less store it.
This device only needs to process and respond to a few incoming signals per second.
There is no need to preserve them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so you constantly use only a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
There is no need for gigabytes or megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in the development of an instant-avoidance technology that Nissan estimates could be in production vehicles within ten years.
An additional application is the integration of the unit with the GPS-satellite navigation system to guide the driver to the specified destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
The name of the precious child.
There is a written version of the multi-tranche $700 billion economic rescue package law, which aims to buy bad loans from banks.
In the first round, half of the amount is spent.
In a new round of talks that will last until after midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders have come to a close in the days-long debate surrounding the $700 billion bailout, Reuters reported.
“We have made serious progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the US House of Representatives.
The compromise on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson, speaking about the result of the compromise, said that the program will work and be effective, but more needs to be done. According to Pelosi, this is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the cart of the economy around.
The written version of the package was released before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday night at 8:00 a.m. Washington time (i.e. 2 a.m. Central European time on Monday), but did not cause a spectacular run on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote on the draft law on the program, which is called the Economic Emergency Stabilization Act of 2008.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night and the White House welcomed the news of the deal.
“We are pleased with the progress made last night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy,” White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program deviates from the Bush administration’s original proposal to spend $700 billion on one-to-one purchases of low-quality, credit-backed securities.
Now, in the first round, up to half of the $700 billion can be spent, with $250 billion immediately spent after Congress is expected to vote on Monday, from which the Treasury Department buys credit-backed, poorly rated securities, and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the president’s decision.
The program will be overseen by a special board, including the president of the Federal Reserve.
Spending the other half of the 700 billion depends on a new resolution from Congress.
Under the law, the Treasury Department can use a combination of tactics: you can buy bad loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities at the same time, as well as other types of "toxic" loans.
Purchases can be made through auctions and directly, the ministry said.
The law allows affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the Treasury guarantees assets of concern, for which the companies will pay a fee commensurate with the expected damages.
Henry Paulson said the law would provide the necessary funds to meet the urgent needs of the U.S. financial system, whether it’s buying bad assets on a large scale, insuring them, or avoiding the systemic risk of a large financial institution collapsing.
“We will take the necessary steps to be ready to implement the law as soon as it is signed into law,” he added.
On the other hand, the bosses of banks in trouble and waiting for government assistance can expect their exit money, which the overseas slang simply calls a golden parachute, to be restricted by the government.
Salaries are restricted only in certain cases, and the limits depend on the way in which the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
The restriction essentially means that if the ministry buys by auction, an additional tax will be levied on the golden parachute unless the bailout banker is retired.
When buying bad loans outright, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that its management funds are not exaggerated.
As part of the picture, the existing golden parachute contracts will remain unchanged, with the restriction applying only to new ones, in order to encourage participation in the program.
This is the first time in U.S. history that there will be a legal restriction on CEO remuneration, said House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank.
In addition, the state acquires the right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the scheme, thus reducing the risk for taxpayers, as they can ultimately win the transaction once the economy and the bank that was rescued recovers.
The bill will require the president to submit a proposal to Congress over the next five years on how to return taxpayers' expected losses from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were those who expressed doubts about the plan.
“It’s not what the American people are asking us to do, it’s not protecting taxpayers’ dollars,” said Republican Congressman Darrell Issa of California.
His Ohio Democrat colleague Mary Kaptur said the measures were being pushed by the same people responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
The domestic sales prices of industry increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007, reports KSH.
The prices of industrial export sales were 1.1 percent higher than in July 2008, and decreased by 3.9 percent year-on-year.
As a result of domestic and export price changes, industrial producer prices were 0.7 percent higher than in the previous month and 3.2 percent higher than a year earlier.
The domestic sales prices of industry increased only minimally, by 0.1 percent compared to the previous month.
The domestic sales prices of manufacturing sectors also increased slightly, by 0.1 percent compared to July.
The biggest price increase occurred in August 2008 in the leather goods and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8 percent), mainly due to the 4.6 percent and 2.5 percent monthly price increase in the bag and strap manufacturing and footwear manufacturing sectors.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical and product manufacturing sector (1.6%).
There was a price decrease in the sectors of petroleum processing (1.4 percent), electrical machinery and instrument production (0.9 percent) and - to a minimum - wood processing (0.1 percent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In the other manufacturing sectors, price growth was between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, which plays a significant role in the domestic sales of industry, prices increased by 0.3 percent in August, mainly due to the delayed impact of the official gas price increase implemented from 1 July.
In a twelve-month comparison, in terms of domestic sales of the manufacturing sectors, prices increased the most in the petroleum processing sector (32.4%).
The manufacture of metalworking products increased by 13.2 percent, and the manufacturing of food, beverages and tobacco by 11 percent.
The price decrease occurred in the manufacture of textiles and textile articles (2.5%) and the manufacture of electrical machinery and instruments (0.3%).
In the other manufacturing sectors, the rate of price increase ranged from 0.6 percent to 9.1 percent.
In the manufacturing industry as a whole, prices increased by 10.2 percent over the past year.
The prices of the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors were 18.7 percent higher than a year earlier.
Among the intended groups of industries, domestic sales showed the highest monthly price increase in August in the manufacturing of capital goods (0.7 per cent).
In the consumer goods sectors, prices increased by 0.3 percent, while in the energy and downstream sectors, prices remained unchanged compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the biggest price increase was observed in the energy and downstream sectors (16.8%).
In the consumer goods sectors, we recorded a 6.8 percent price increase and in the capital goods sector, a 1.4 percent price decrease.
The industry’s export sales prices in HUF increased by 1.1 percent in August, compared to the previous month, and decreased by 3.9 percent in 12 months.
In one month, our domestic currency weakened by 1.7 percent against the euro and 7.1 percent against the dollar, and by 7.5 percent against the euro and 15.9 percent against the dollar compared to August 2007.
Will I need a visa for the United States next year?
Kinga G<0xC3><0xB6>ncz sees a good chance that the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will enter into force around January 12 – the Foreign Minister spoke about this in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In his opinion, “almost everything now depends only on whether the electronic access and control system will be established in time overseas.”
At the same time, he drew attention to the fact that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists will have to register themselves before departure.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington from today.
He will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will confer the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary Middle Cross with the Star, and will hold talks with foreign policy advisers of Barack Obama’s Democratic Party and John McCain’s Republican presidential candidate.
The bailout package includes Barack Obama and McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for president of the two major US parties, pledged their support for the government’s $700 billion bailout package on Sunday, but some politicians are demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
Representatives of Congress and the administration announced after days of marathon negotiations in the early hours of Sunday morning that they had reached an agreement in principle on the bank rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package aimed at defrosting the frozen credit market have become central issues in the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain claim to be better suited than their competitors to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest surveys, with the rise of economic issues, Obama once again gained some advantage, the advantage of McCain, which he gained after the Republican convention with the nomination of vice president Sarah Palin, melted away.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that the law on the $700 billion package would be quickly passed by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal includes the consumer protection clauses that he also supported.
“We have to act now, with responsibility ... your jobs, your savings, your entire industries, the stability of the entire economy are in danger,” he said before a crowd of 35,000.
He did not fail to call McCain’s economic ideas outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said, “We’re all going to have a hard time swallowing this, but doing nothing is simply not a viable option.”
The Republican senator said the proposal included setting up a committee to oversee the finance minister and limiting the severance pay of top executives, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no meaningful role in the talks, but that he was in daily contact with the minister.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House would vote on the bill on Monday.
Review of the German-speaking area
The right-wing camp is untouched, only within the camp the voters have become more self-aware - this is how Der Spiegel analyzes the CSU's weak performance in Bavaria.
The Haiders are ready to govern Austria to prevent the Red-Black Coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine Franz Walter, the Bavarian revolution devours its fathers, he analyses the causes of the CSU’s dramatic defeat.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
For decades the Christian socialists have been renewing Bavaria - and now it is these modern citizens who are turning away from them.
The change of era is also the problem of the entire Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday, a process that was almost exactly ten years ago likely came to an end: the indisputable hegemony of a state party had ended.
In 1998, the CSU hit 47.7% for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, so back in the so-called Stoiber era.
This is due to the CSU’s consistent modernization of the province, which devours its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were very wrong about the pace. However, it could not be without consequences for the loyalty of the voters of the CSU to secularization, educational achievements, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developing regions of Bavaria.
Modernisation is accompanied by an increase in opportunities, and the political consequences of this are also visible.
The right-wing camp is untouched, only within the camp did the voters become more self-confident, more critical, more stubborn.
It is also remarkable that in the last few weeks, it was precisely the classic bourgeois groups that most distanced themselves from the CSU; the liberals, the industrialists, the high-school graduates and the university graduates.
Support for the CSU is down 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative Viennese daily’s article entitled “Who, with whom? Party leaders on moderate coalition issues” deals with the confused domestic political situation that arose after the Austrian elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the SP<0xC3><0x96> from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open to negotiations in all directions, and the Greens do not yet want to discuss the coalition.
The election has taken place, everything now revolves around the coalition; in the debate on public television, the party leaders barely allowed any insight into their cards.
SP<0xC3><0x96> President Werner Faymann confirmed his intention to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that it is possible for the two parties to cooperate - in some provinces and in the social partnership.
The question of whether a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current <0xC3><0x96>VP President as Vice-Chancellor, could be imagined, was left open by Faymann.
In any case, the Sch<0xC3><0xBC>ssel-Molterer course was voted down.
There is no question of repeating this course.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be effective if Faymann attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is completely open in the party for the time being, and the issues must necessarily be discussed within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
President J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider BZ<0xC3><0x96> has once again shown himself to be open in all directions.
“To prevent a red-black coalition, we are ready to take government responsibility,” Haider said.
Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Equal Opportunities Summit, which this year will be hosted by France representing the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union, began today in Paris.
L<0xC3><0xAD>via Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ka, Fidesz MEP of the European People’s Party, in her message to the plenary as one of the main speakers of the professional meeting, drew attention to educational segregation, because it is one of the most serious violations affecting Roma children and, moreover, it is the most serious obstacle to their enforcement.
The high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, on behalf of the French Presidency.
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, European social partners and the most important European human rights and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ka warned, according to the press office of the Fidesz MEP group, that in addition to discrimination in recruitment, Roma are excluded from the labour market primarily due to their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma young people do not have upper secondary education and only a minor part of them can obtain tertiary education as a result of poor quality primary education."
Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ka also stressed that, as a fundamental human right, education plays a key role in the implementation of other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children can strengthen the economies of the EU Member States.
According to the Member of Parliament, it is necessary to raise awareness of these connections among the Roma and non-Roma.
The earlier a Roma student starts school, the more chances they have of becoming productive members of the labour market; they contribute to the national budget through taxes on income and consumption.
“Roma must be guaranteed their right to quality education on the basis of their EU citizenship, and the elimination of their low-quality and segregated education must be guaranteed,” Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ka said.
According to the MEP, the goal and action-oriented cooperation of the European Union is necessary for the immediate acceleration of the desegregation processes in schools, for which the correct enforcement of the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is essential.
“The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and Roma children must be given the opportunities provided by the democratic space to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens,” Jár<0xC3><0xB3>ka said.
As part of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, the aim of the European Summit on Equal Opportunities for All, which has been held annually since last year's meeting in Berlin, is to provide a unique forum for promoting the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and Member State level.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
At the end of October, the fate of the cast-off Huber-Beckstein duo will be decided
Despite the ugly election failure, heads have not yet fallen, and the discussion of personnel issues has been postponed at the peaks of the Bavarian CSU for the time being.
Party leader Erwin Huber and provincial prime minister G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Beckstein can still stay in place, the question is how long the grace will last.
The fate of the tandem, which has suffered a catastrophic loss of 17 percent, will be decided by an extraordinary party congress on the last weekend of October.
In any case, the members of the much-criticized pair made it clear that they do not hold on to their chairs with all their might.
This was an attempt to appease the angry members of the faction and the base, who the day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who was still at the top of his game, the Christian social union gained 60.7 percent, but now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, it only managed to get 43.4 percent of its strength.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "dominant" in Bavaria, which accounted for 18 percent of Germany's GDP.
Although the conservatives continue to count high in the southern province, which is crucial for the Hungarian economy, they will be forced to form a coalition in the future.
As one of the first signs of the party’s rearrangement, Vice President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, a potential successor to Huber, will also be part of a tight-knit reconnaissance team that will begin exploratory talks with the liberal FDP and the right-wing Free Voters over a possible government coalition in Munich.
It is a strange irony that Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was used by Huber-Beckstein as a coup d’etat, gets into the legislature on the list of the Free Voters, and then they ruthlessly dealt with the ambitious municipal politician.
The CSU leaders are now putting all their energy into somehow stabilizing Beckstein.
Stoiber, the former provincial prime minister and former CSU president, has called September 28 the bitterest day of his political career.
Huber made some bitter comments to the CDU on Monday, saying they deserved much more support from the siblings.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to both the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel cannot become chancellor if the CSU, which played a significant role in the 2005 national success, is not somehow brought back to life.
Merkel, who was disappointed by the fiasco, said the loss of CSU soil would not have a negative impact on the Grand Coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, of course, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to deal with, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will continue.
The SPD achieved its weakest result in Bavaria since 1946 with 18.6%.
Lukashenko's opposition: 110–0
Not a single member of the opposition was allowed into the Belarusian parliament following Sunday’s elections.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), by the illegality of counting votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election.
Although the 110-member legislature of the country of 10 million has been without opposition for more than a decade, the United Democratic Forces (UDF) opposition, united before yesterday’s elections, seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who renewed his presidential mandate for the fourth time in the disputed clean elections in 2006, would this time “allow” the appearance of some opposition members in the parliament.
The ODSZ also withdrew from the previously contemplated boycott.
Against the background of opposition expectations, Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia – which has taken a loan to reduce the constantly increasing price of Russian natural gas imports, and has also contributed to the transfer of Beltransgaz to Russia, which owns several gas pipelines through the country – wished to improve its relations with the EU.
He referred to the easing of the OSCE’s emphasis on positive moves rather than shortcomings in the assessment of the election campaign, such as the suspension of one-third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's Monday's flash report also objected to the campaign - during which opposition candidates were essentially not allowed to appear in the press - and, in particular, that the opposition was not allowed to be present at the count of votes.
Nevertheless, according to the opposition, there is a noticeable improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is willing to engage in minor confrontations with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which are separated from Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus is a federal state on paper, has been considering the two areas independent for a month.
“We have taken two steps forward, one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun,” Milinkevich told the paper.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this should remain, despite the fact that “the power was afraid to allow even one opposition member to enter the weightless parliament”.
The opposition is not planning any protest action in view of the results, but rather is trying to convey its message about the need for economic reforms to the electorate.
“Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, we have to print the opposition papers in Russia, the local authorities are putting obstacles to the dissemination, but I can still see that more and more people are supporting the change, even among the elderly,” Milinkevich said, referring to the fact that Lukashenko’s regime, which considers the creation of social security as its main result, is not even the most officially supported pensioner layer.
“Because of the country’s indebtedness and the increase in the trade deficit, it is a matter of time before social security is disrupted, which is reminiscent of the silence of the cemetery,” Milinkevich said.
As opposed to the opposition politician, Russian observers declared the elections democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, head of the CIS mission, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in deeds", so the lack of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "Breakfast only before work"
Uniquely in the history of the Chigi Palace, revolving doors have been installed for the entry and exit of employees.
As of today, this new measure will go into effect against the crafty, to filter out those who block and then go out for a coffee during working hours.
The anti-sloppy novelty was presented today by Minister of Public Administration Renato Brunetta and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Office of the Prime Minister.
“Swivel gates,” said Brunetta, “are designed to make work better and more efficient, reduce absenteeism and increase services.”
“A new, more responsible and transparent period is coming.
This is real reform," Brunetta said.
The Chigi Palace completes the installation of all the buildings of the Council of Ministers.
According to Masi, “the installation of revolving doors is also symbolically important.”
There was no opposition from the employees, the secretary-general confirmed: "The employees approved the measure, everyone cooperated."
In a word, breakfast is over during business hours, no more coffee and brioche.
Brunetta smiles and says, “A good cappuccino at seven in the morning can do wonders.”
The College of Administration of Rome
“In three months, the absences of public sector employees due to illness decreased by 50 percent, which means that 60,000 more people go to work in one year.”
He added that the Italian administration should be made more efficient.
According to the Minister, the wage dynamics of which have been twice as high as those of the private sector in the last 8-10 years, and have also exceeded the inflation rate by far.
At the same time, thousands of civil servants gathered to join a petition sponsored by the Italian Association of Environmental and Consumer Protection Associations to protest against the Brunetta Decree.
“While the Minister of Public Administration boasts data supporting the reduction of absenteeism due to illness, the army of ‘tireless idlers’ is constantly growing,” the Consumer Protection Association writes.
“Thousands of honest and hard-working public servants from all over Italy have gathered to declare war on the unlawful provisions of the decree.”
The Regional Administrative Court is challenged, among other things, the abolition of supplementary sick pay for illnesses due to service reasons, the extension of the period of stay at home of workers on sick leave, which means the period during which the patient visitor may appear, and several other aspects included in the new provisions prescribed by the Minister.
Workplace accidents: Napolitano says prevention is more important than anything else
In Italy, 2,500 accidents at work occur every day, of which 3 lead to death and 27 to permanent disability.
According to the data of the occupational accident insurance company, there were nearly 1,200 deaths at workplaces in 2007.
The figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death and claims almost twice as many victims as homicide.
Today, for the 58th time, Anmil is organising the Day of Victims of Accidents at Work, traditionally held in all Italian counties on the second Sunday of October, to draw the attention of institutions, social organisations and the mass media to this dramatic problem.
"The alarming data provided by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of the last few days, confirm that prevention plays a particularly important role in workplace accidents," President Giorgio Napolitano said in a message to Pietro Mercandelli, President of the National Association of Workplace Accident Invalids.
The head of state sincerely praised the association’s “persevering commitment to the prevention of accidents at work, the protection of the interests of workers in accidents, the assistance of the victims’ family members and the sensitization of public opinion”.
“These tragedies, which are natural and frankly shared by everyone, and which are of such a size, arouse the interest of the media and the general public, but in reality we have to face dramatic cases every day, which are repeated over and over again.”
Napolitano openly admits: "There is undoubtedly a lack of resources, the funding of education and information is crucial.
Initiatives within the school aimed at directly educating young people who are about to enter the world of work are particularly important.
It is our duty to maintain interest in the phenomenon, not to allow attention to be lost to the social importance of the issue, and to have more effective legislation that must be enforced.
For his part, the President of the House of Commons, Gianfranco Fini, stressed “the grave social significance of fatal accidents at work, which weighs on the conscience of all of us, and the institutions are required to put an end to it as soon as possible.”
"The data on accidents at work show a slight improvement, but the number of deaths of this kind is still incredibly high," said Pietro Mercandelli, president of Anmil.
"But we don't want this downward trend to be accompanied by a downward trend of attention, because it's precisely when attention is slack that the greatest tragedies occur."
"We believe that, at a general level, we are still not doing all we can to combat this phenomenon, which could be solved through a complex programme of action.
We believe that there should be stricter supervision and control, Mercandelli stressed, as well as stronger intervention in the field of workforce training, starting with school education."
“Further efforts are also needed to inform and sensitise the public,” he added.
What is most needed, however, is a more responsible employer environment in the face of a phenomenon that is a social problem.”
Mr Mercandelli then criticised the "gradual deterioration of the safety net for victims of accidents at work" and the "aid trend towards which the system has drifted in recent years".
“The aim is therefore to give back to the workers the security provided by insurance, because the fate of the victims of an accident cannot depend on the arbitrary and sometimes divisive measures of the legislators.”
MP3 players can cause hearing loss
Permanent hearing loss can be caused by listening to portable playback devices such as MP3 players for extended periods of time and at high volume levels.
In its report published in Brussels, the European Commission, citing an opinion published today by the EU's Scientific Committee on New and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR).
“The report shows that 5 to 10 percent of people who listen to their portable music player at a high volume for more than one hour per day for five years may have permanent hearing loss,” the report said.
“It is worrying that young people who use high-volume portable music players and mobile phones on a large scale and often do not realise that they can cause irreversible hearing damage,” said Meglena Kuneva.
“Scientific surveys indicate an undisputed risk that we urgently need to respond to,” he added.
The most important task is to inform consumers and disseminate this information widely.
In the light of this opinion, we also need to review existing control systems to ensure that they are effective and keep pace with the latest technologies."
Brussels has asked the independent scientific committee to examine the problem in the light of the proliferation of personal music players and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise.
"Researchers confirm that there is cause for concern, and the European Commission, in cooperation with Member States and stakeholders, is ready to explore possible measures to protect children and young people exposed to noise from portable players and similar devices," he concluded.
The current European safety standard specifies a maximum noise level of 100 dB that can be emitted by personal music players, but there is growing concern about data on hearing loss resulting from the excessive use of such sound sources.
At the same time, there are solutions, such as reducing the level and duration of noise pollution, which can significantly reduce these hearing impairments.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee states that users of portable players who listen to music at high volume levels (over 89 decibels) for five hours a week are exposed to noise levels above the current maximum levels for noise at work.
If a person listens to music for a long time in similar circumstances, there is a risk of permanent hearing loss after five years.
This affects about 5-10% of users of portable devices, which could mean 2.5-10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno set up commission for the future of the capital
Starts today, runs until March, results are expected in June.
This is the timetable set by the Metropolitan Municipality for the operation of the "Future of the Capital of Rome" committee, which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the baths of Caracalla.
Over the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop Rome’s policies.
After the closing speech in March, the study and the plans will be evaluated in the general assembly and the municipal committee, so that the strategic plan of the capital, officially approved by the Municipality and Mayor Gianni Alemanno, can be submitted in June.
“It is a completely independent commission, in which all political, social and cultural ideas are represented,” Alemanno emphasizes, “and its task is to draw up proposals for Rome’s development ideas on which the political decision-makers, i.e. the General Assembly and the Municipal Commission, can rely.
We are not talking about any conflict of competence, we just wanted a platform where great plans can be made for the good of Rome.
In March, after completing its work, the committee will be dissolved because it has a fixed-term mandate.
In June, we will submit a strategic plan based on the work of the "Future of the Capital of Rome" committee, the Mayor said.
To those who consider the Commission's work superfluous, arguing that the opinion it has set up is not binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will do and the quality of the proposals it will put on the table.
If the standard proves to be adequate, as in France for the Attali Commission, which I am sure is the case for Rome, its contribution will play an important role.
The power of politics is often dissipated in dealing with day-to-day affairs, as well as in dealing with urgent cases that arise from time to time.
We, on the other hand, take a long-term view and plan for the longer term and are committed to Rome’s development and future.”
The mayor of Rome would like to make it clear that “this Commission cannot be considered a useless “head of water” because it will be completely free, it will not cost the citizens of Rome a single euro, but instead serves as an inspiration and aims to attract the best minds of the capital”.
“We need an open-ended and flexible strategic framework that will enable our city to make the leap in quality it so desperately needs, thinking unitedly about its future,” he said.
The future, in which the Mayor of Rome emphasizes that “it will not only be limited to the current framework of self-government, but will look much further”, is not only the future metropolis and the status of the capital, but also “the role that it can and must play as the capital of Rome, of Europe and of the Mediterranean”.
Obama, the first anti-American president, we'll show you why.
A prominent, self-proclaimed American politician wrote: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
Jimmy Carter was the first to ruin the American economy with his decisions, and he had a close relationship (as he still does as a private individual) with hostile Islam.
As the election day approaches, the attacks on Obama are intensifying.
A Miami woman wrote on the Internet: "This man is full of ambition.
“Obama arrogantly believes he can win the highest public dignitary of a nation that has so far only had two black governors and five black senators.”
These attacks are, in fact, meaningless; they are racist, of course, but they do not answer the voters' question as to whether he will be a good president. Then there are the polls: they indicate that Obama will win, and he will win by a considerable margin.
In this case, too, there are those who listen to their emotions and not their brains.
Inside the southern United States, a Mississippi newspaper wrote in its editorial, "We know very well who the true American patriot in the polling booth votes for.
There is a side of the American way of thinking that has remained hidden until the last moment.
“Just say what you want and we’ll know where to put it, Obama or McCain.”
Some people swear that if Obama wins, they will leave the United States.
Such words have never been uttered until now, when the success of the black candidate is almost certain.
Yet, despite all these speculations, the Democrats’ winning weapon is George Bush himself.
A total of 1,500 people were asked what the mistakes were during Bush’s tenure: 89% said Iraq.
America is changing.
This nation lost 50,000 troops in Vietnam, and it was kicked in the ass by flying home.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers were killed, and the Americans did not have to pack.
Most of us think that Iraq was Bush’s weak point.
There is a huge task ahead for anyone who takes the place of George W.
USA: the economic collapse is already felt by journalists, the time of austerity has also come in the editorial offices. Many blame the Internet, because of the “death” of the printed press.
The PEW research institute asked 500 American journalists what they thought about the future state and intellectual power of their profession.
At the moment, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their own future.
However, they did not explicitly state that their concerns about credibility had diminished.
They don’t feel as isolated as they used to.
The problem with American journalists is money.
The 2008 financial crisis was the failure of a weak economic model.
Another serious problem is the restrictions imposed on newsrooms, or newspaper editors.
“If we don’t want traditional journalism, in the sense that it is understood by the public at large, to shrink to a minimum, this problem needs to be solved,” the journalists said.
Today, American journalism is characterized by a highly visible and complex pessimism.
Sixty percent of journalists and top executives working in the print media are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
At the local level, 65% of journalists are in senior management positions.
Printed versus electronic press.
The press has no difficulty in seeing where the Internet is heading.
The biggest publishers are making their way to the Internet, which many believe is the “killer” of the printed press.
The “economic pressure” felt by journalists has risen to 79 percent.
The 500 journalists surveyed have admitted to voting for technology in the hope that it might benefit journalism.
Today, in the American press, there is a gulf between the editorial directors, that is, the directors, and the correspondents who work for them.
At the national level, 56 percent of executives are confident that their correspondents share their information with others, compared to only 23 percent at the local level.
Some people associate this with a secure job.
At the national level, 47 percent of managers fear losing their jobs within three years.
In the case of journalists, this figure is 30%.
In America, the issue of "secure work" at team level (in the case of our editors, ed.) is constantly on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists have a contract.
In a nation as vast as the United States of 300 million people, with thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and Internet service providers, employers usually offer as much as they want, so it works on a “must or not” basis.
Directors usually receive high salaries, and editors can earn up to $10,000 per month, in addition to their pension and health insurance premiums.
Freedom, on the other hand, works on a rather complicated principle: in the first year x days, in the third also until after a certain time the maximum of 15 days is reached.
But American journalists, by their own admission, often get “sick” during the year.
Everything depends on the climate.
UNIPOL: COURT OF ROME: STAYING IN DANILO COPPOLA GROTTAFERRATA
Carmelo Rinaudo, President of the Second Criminal Division of the Court of Rome, rejected the application of Danilo Coppola, a real estate professional, who wanted to move from his residence in Grottaferrata to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for economic bankruptcy as part of an investigation into the Unipol - BNL share exchange agreement.
Last week, during the proceedings initiated against him, the house arrest was lifted and it was changed to a ban on abandoning residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, requested that the real estate professional be allowed to move from the small rural town to his apartment in the capital.
According to the court, however, these commutes (for which the prosecutor had made a proposal to refuse) would allow the company’s affairs to be influenced and access to the evidence against it.
Elites in Danger
The phenomenon was already felt a few days ago, when the House of Representatives did not vote for the $700 billion rescue package put forward by the White House: a significant number of Americans were and still are more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
As evidenced by yesterday’s New York Times, which reports that the current crisis has created a rupture within the Republican Party, which is increasingly divided between the traditional, subdued East Coast approach, which supports federal institutions and business circles, and the growing anti-Washington and anti-financial world trend in the Central and Southern states.
This line was expressed in a critical manner during the House vote mentioned in the introduction.
However, the above event is only one of the significant changes that the ongoing economic restructuring predicts or allows to be seen, not only in the United States, but throughout the Western world, and perhaps even beyond.
It seems that the crisis, both in the USA and in Europe, is only speeding up those phenomena that have been latent for a long time and which are solidifying in this new atmosphere and are finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the re-establishment of the dual category of state sovereignty, in connection with a kind of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis affects those banking and financial institutions that, although they have close relations with the rest of the world, are primarily, and to a fairly large extent, attracting people and families who live in a single country, a single state.
This, in turn, poses a direct political difficulty for those in government: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people who are also voters.
Thus, while the crisis appears to be global in economic terms, it is almost exclusively national in political terms.
Political internationalism seems to be essentially off-line: the European Union is a shining example of this, unable to define a single political direction, juggling different interests and different national strategies.
So everyone is waiting for the intervention, the rescue package, the recovery and the new rules from the individual national governments, but most of all for the opening up of the funds: because only the individual states have economic resources, financial resources that are capable of putting things right.
They have the means and the authority to use them: under certain circumstances, they have two invaluable resources that probably no other market and no international organisation will ever possess to such an extent.
Moreover, the new emphasis placed by the crisis on the nation-state is fully in line with the fact that economic growth in recent times attaches increasing importance to a factor that is closely related to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had already entered the abstract world of the network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, and we were convinced that the global financial world was destined to rule the world, we had to realize that our future increasingly depended on things that were not at all abstract, such as water, crops and oil.
Things that can be transported from one side of the planet to the other, yet they are completely bound to a limited place, a territory.
So the man who controls the area has a lot more trump cards than the man who, unfortunately, was born in a place where there is no crop, no oil, and no water.
This brings me to the second novelty, which suggests a kind of fault line.
Whoever says territory, state, government, necessarily also says politics, in other words, leadership.
From this point of view, the economic crisis seems to be producing two parallel phenomena:
On the one hand, the objective recognition of the need for credible leadership, someone who can take control of events.
On the other hand, the current leadership, especially the economic leaders, is bringing a complete loss of credit, who have proved completely inadequate and have proven that there is still a lot of vague ground ahead of them.
Together, the two are even more profound and, in a sense, more disturbing: a sense of loss of credibility, impatience, inadequacy and isolation that affects the entire leadership elite in more and more Western countries.
It seems, therefore, that there is a growing belief among the population that the era of the social elite, which has been at its peak so far, has come to an end, even before they have embraced their actions, their experiences, their way of life, their culture, in the complex sense of the word.
In a word, the demand for leadership, in a veiled form, fosters a diverse but strong delegitimation movement against the ruling class and the traditional political system. This may be manifested in the unanticipated "revolts" of the voters, or in the sudden changes in the mood of the American Congress in recent times.
It seems that the traditional elite, with its parties, programs, and we might even say that together with its customs, press, and renowned intellectuals, it is less and less able to understand, and therefore less and less to represent, what has been happening in the deeper layers of Western society for some time.
Nevertheless, to speak of “the impending revolt of the masses” would, frankly, be an exaggeration.
But it doesn't hurt to walk with your eyes open.
We can walk on the wall with super-strong glue
Use a super-strong glue to defeat gravity and walk the wall like Spider-Man.
This goal has been set by several U.S. research centers, and a group of four institutions is close to a solution.
Using a piece of glue measuring just 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to glue a 100-pound body to a vertical wall and keep it there.
The American journal Study-A Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team was born from the further development of previously existing special carbon nanotube materials.
“The principle of the glue should be thought of as a tubing system similar to a pack of spaghetti,” says Zhong Lin Wang, a researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The researchers drew the idea from the gecko’s microscopic folds on the covered leg, which provides the animal with perfect traction.
Tests with materials such as glass, Teflon, and sandpaper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more effective than the feet of these reptiles, but at the same time it "easily peels off the wall," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's School of Engineering.
"This material can be useful as a temporary adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe, but researchers are thinking more of a less impressive use of the connection of electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes conduct heat and electricity well.
You can also find other applications in the field of space research.
Superheroes can wait.
THE OTHER RESEARCH - University of California, Berkeley is also experimenting with a new adhesive.
According to an article published in the journal American Chemical Society, scientists in California have demonstrated a hair-like adhesive made of microfiber material that undergoes self-cleaning when moving on the surface, so it always provides perfect adhesion.
With fruit juice, it's forbidden!
Be careful with grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These thirst-quenching drinks with a high vitamin content, which are especially popular in the summer, if they are introduced into the body together with certain life-saving drugs, alter their absorption, increasing or decreasing their effect, depending on the case.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, spoke at the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia about the risks associated with the combination of canned or fresh fruit juices and certain medications. The professor announced at the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia that a glass of grapefruit, orange or apple juice could reduce the absorption of certain life-saving drugs, preventing their beneficial effects and putting them at risk.
Grapefruit juice has been on the stand before the defendants when it was found to be able to increase the effects of some antibiotics, antihistamines, anti-anxiety drugs, heart rhythm regulators and nerve medicines to levels considered toxic.
DANGEROUS MEDICINES - Two years ago, the Italian Institute of Pharmacy itself published the news in its official gazette and also warned doctors and patients to take the risks associated with this combination seriously and to watch what they drink when taking drugs such as Diazepam or Methadone.
GRAPEFRUIT – According to the researchers, both orange and apple juice contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of medications.
A long list of active substances, the absorption of which is hindered by grapefruit and other juices, could be listed.
Michele Carruba, professor of pharmaceuticals at the State University of Milan, points out: “Such discoveries are usually immediately reported to the various national and international pharmaceutical institutes, which, if necessary, make sure to change the information on the product’s leaflet.
That’s why you should always read the information on the medicine you’re taking, and if something isn’t clear, don’t let it get to you, but ask your doctor or pharmacist clearly.”
Paul Krugman wins Nobel Prize in Economics
Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for his analysis of the spatial relationships between trade models and economic activity.
The 55-year-old neo-Keynesian Krugman is a Princeton University professor and a well-known New York Times publicist.
Krugman is one of the Bush administration’s most critical critics of economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 2001 terrorist attack, when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman predicted in an editorial published in the New York Times that the latter event would have even more decisive consequences for the history of the United States than the collapse of the Twin Towers.
This forecast has provoked quite a lot of controversy, and it has been reproached on several occasions by the economist, but we now know that it was accurate.
“I’m surprised, and a little shocked, at how quickly public interest has moved beyond the scandalous collapse of Enron or Worldcom,” Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a “very valuable economist” and “rather aggressively spreads his criticism of the Bush administration’s excessive liberalism.”
Open Office, third edition was worth the "anti-Microsoft" package
Today, OpenOffice.org 3.0, an open-source application suite designed to increase personal productivity, is being released as a free alternative to Microsoft Office, targeting an increasing number of people, from home users to office users, from the liberal professions to public administrations.
After nearly a year of work under the supervision of SUN Microsystem and by volunteer developers, the new Open Office brings more new features to the public: in addition to the welcome screen and the redesigned, less spartan user interface, it also offers more essential features, such as compatibility with Apple’s Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ISO-standard ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2.
Special attention has been paid to compatibility with Office 2007 so that Open Office can open Microsoft documents with the new extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Another interesting feature is the specific functionality of some modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations. This can be useful when sending files by email. Another feature supports importing PDF files into a graphics module, while maintaining a page-place layout.
In the same interface, you can also create "hybrid PDF" documents, which combines the typical Adobe format with spreadsheet or word processing elements.
Sharing within applications has also undergone several improvements: the spreadsheet supports the shared use of workbooks, but prevents overwriting of each other's work. Each employee's comments are marked in a different color, which helps to make them easier to recognize during the verification phase.
Some companies are already working on making some of OpenOffice’s features available from the Internet (on the cloud), so the final version is likely to be released in the coming weeks.
The Italian version can be downloaded from http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html.
In addition to the usual Windows and Mac OS operating systems, the software package is also available for Linux.
Upon request, we can take over the installation CD at home or at our workplace.
Free is probably the biggest attraction when it comes to the home application, but the Open Office suite is now trying to get into the business sector as well, as it can count on a number of administrative and school projects.
There is also a lack of education, consulting and service services ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open up new business prospects.
Open Office consists of five core modules: Writer, a word processor for Word; Calc, a spreadsheet to replace Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint-like presentations; Dbase, the most well-known, similar to Access database management; and finally Draw, the graphics module.
The target for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, but if you consider that the new version is now at 3.6 million, that number is likely to be higher than expected.
Kohl’s results are also positive, this is the fourth doping case
At the last stage of the Tour de France, one of the participants, Austrian Bernhard Kohl, who competed in the Gerolsteiner team, once again set a positive pattern and won the bronze medal as well as the jersey of the best mountaineer.
The news was published in the Equipe Internet newspaper.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth contestant to be selected, after Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepol from Italy and Stefan Schumacher from Germany, another Gerolsteiner contestant, who scored a positive result in the third-generation EPO Cera test.
Kohl’s blood sample, like the one tested in recent weeks, has been tested in laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the control tests confirm a positive Cera result, the Austrian will lose its third place and will be banned from racing for two years.
Pierre Bordry, head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, confirmed the positive results of Kohl’s third-generation EPO test and told the Associated Press that he had reported the positive results to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian won the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, as well as the polka dot jersey for the best mountaineer.
IMMIGRANTS: NEW YORK TIMES IS ASKING THE QUESTION, ITALY IS A RASSIST?
Italy has only recently changed from a country of emigrants to one of the favourite destinations of reluctantly received immigrants.
Based on the case of Abdul William Guibre, a young man in Burkina Faso who was murdered last month in Milan for stealing a box of crackers, the New York Times has a long article devoted to the debate on racism in Italy.
The case characterizes what the New York Times calls the “northern paradox”: the “strongest integration and highest employment” in the northern regions, while “anti-immigrant sentiment and support for the Northern League” are also the strongest in the country.
In support of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also cites incidents in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
In fact.
The new laws demanded by the League, which would tighten the reins on immigration and make it easier to deport illegal immigrants, were also cited as an example of a mood shift in Italy.
Both the Pope and the President of the Republic point out this tendency: “Giorgio Napolitano met Benedict XVI at the Quirinale Palace and proposed that the State and the Church work together to overcome racism.”
Students suffer from expensive rents, a room can cost up to 900 euros
The market for student accommodation is not affected by the crisis.
According to a recent survey by Sunia, the Union of Tenants, a student can pay up to €900 for a single room in Milan, €700 in Florence, €650 in Naples and €600 in Rome.
"The scale of the phenomenon is now so staggering that, because of the huge costs that families have to bear, it prevents large numbers of students from learning," explains Laura Mariani, head of the study office at Sunia. "The high demand from students in these cities has distorted the market to such an extent that a general price increase has also started to affect local residents."
In most cases, real estate offers also contain a number of irregularities: unregistered contracts with no rent limitation, with linked sublease.
According to Sunia, an exceptional measure would be needed to allow prices to be maximised by revising the tax system.
The survey shows that in Milan, around Brianza, a bed costs 450 euros; a single room costs 650 euros (near Bande Nere) to an average of 800 euros (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) or 900 euros (near Vittoria).
In Florence, a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, and a room costs about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where most students live near the university, a single bed costs €250/280 for a double room and €370-500 for a single room.
In Rome, in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), they charge about 600 euros for a single bed and 450 for a double bed.
Slightly cheaper (550 euros for a single room) are the prices of other universities around (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
Some savings can be made in the suburbs: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar districts.
For a bed in Naples, 300/450 euros is charged, for a room from 400 to 600 euros. The price range is the highest in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, a single bed costs 250/350 euros and at least 350 euros for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they represent a greater weight within the city budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where students from outside the EU often seek accommodation, there is another anomaly: the rent charged to foreign students is about 25 to 30 percent higher than that charged to Italian tenants.
Good-bye, old Cinema Paradiso, the time of the old cinema halls is over in the cities
Traditional cinemas close in favor of Multiplexes.
“A city without cinemas, a blind city, is like a face without eyes.”
The images by director Giuseppe Tornatore are a powerful illustration of what is happening in the Italian cities and rural regions.
The displacement of cinemas - the emergence of large multi-screen cinemas in the suburbs and the consequent withering away of single-screen cinemas in city centres - seems to be an inevitable and irreversible process, but at the same time it bears all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
When places full of history and memories disappear, "it's like having a friend go away, an acquaintance with whom we shared our journey and many experiences," says Cinema Paradiso director. The film, which 20 years ago may have been an Oscar award, as well as the lost Grand Prix of the Cannes Festival Tornatoré, tells the lyrical story of a small-town movie after a yearning,
The figures provided by the largest association of operators, Anec, are clear: 316 traditional cinemas closed in the last five years. The biggest losses were recorded in cinemas in large cities: 10 cinemas closed in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin, and 5 in Palermo.
Emilia-Romagna is in the lead among the most affected regions, losing 82 one-room cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And that the proliferation of multiplexes is responsible for their disappearance is no better evidence than the fact that Italy has the highest number of newly opened multi-room cinemas in these three regions: in the last five years, the number of cinemas has increased by 195 in Lombardy, by 81 in Tuscany and by the same amount in Emilia-Romagna.
“The number of units in Italy has increased irrationally,” says Paolo Protti, president of Anec. “It’s okay to build new facilities, but you should also ensure the survival of those that already exist, because when an urban cinema closes, not all of its entrants are willing to go through the multiplexes.
Not to mention the unfilled funds intended to support the operators: the overdue debt of the State is estimated at around EUR 10 million.
From an ethical and moral point of view, it is shameful that the government does not comply with the legislation in force.
We would need 16 to 18 million euros a year to maintain the market.”
The case of Bologna deserves special attention. It is the first Italian city that, in its concern over the closures, decided to remedy the problem through an agreement between the municipality and Anec in order to protect and boost the one-room cinemas in the outer and inner city.
The provisions would include tax incentives for operators and benefits for the public to facilitate accessibility: viewers would be able to enter restricted zones and park in certain parking areas at reduced rates.
“I like this initiative,” says Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope that other cities, even with other measures, will follow Bologna’s example.
But it’s also certain that traditional cinemas, in order to be able to fight back against the domination of multiplexes, have to improve the sound and image quality, because today’s audiences are much more demanding.
The preservation of traditional cinema has always been an important issue for me: the closure of Supercinema in Bagheria, where I spent my childhood and adolescence, gave me the spark that made me finally make Cinema Paradiso, even though I had been thinking about it for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, so when I go to the Via Nazionale to see the closed Rialto or the Quirinale, so as not to see the blackened posters, I turn my head away.
Close ties between politics and 'ndrangheta, arrest of mayor Gioia Tauro
“The mayor of Gioia Tauro supported the interests of the Piromalli clan in municipal decisions.”
The judges of the Calabria Anti-Mafia Directorate have made serious accusations against the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno, Carlo Martelli, who were arrested this morning on charges of outside involvement in a criminal network.
He was handcuffed to Gioacchino Piromalli, a senior interlocutor between the clan and the administration, as well as to his nephew, a lawyer of the same name as the boss, who had previously been convicted of involvement in a mafia-like criminal network and charged with 10 million euros in damages.
"Ignorance of all legal and moral rules, and even good taste," state prosecutors write. The two local governments declared their intention to pay an advisory fee to the lawyer Piromalli.
“So the clan would have had official access to City Hall, which would have given them additional control and direction over the administration, which is already significant.
Agazio Loiero, president of the assembly of the region of Calabria, does not hide the fact that in the region "there is a lot of collusion between local institutions and the organized underworld": There are areas where the spread of the mafia is stronger than elsewhere, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But many local politicians resist the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, the heroes who stay clean."
The arrests this morning are a continuation of the July events when the police announced that they had succeeded in decapitating the Piromalli clan.
The municipal committee of Gioia Tauro was dissolved once in 1991, due to alleged mergers between organised crime and the local government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the Christian Democratic mayor at the time of the dissolution, led the center-right coalition in the second round in 2006.
He shouted a scandal when the County Hall ordered the dissolution of the municipal committee.
The then Interior Minister, Marco Minnini, was summoned to appear before the court, accusing him of plotting everything politically, but the court, in an arrest warrant signed this morning, said that the Piromalli clan had gone so far as to demand that the A3 project be changed.
According to state prosecutors, the wiretapping ordered against Dal Torrione showed that “it was willing to meet the demands of an entrepreneur, who is known to represent a large group known to be close to the Piromalli family, and subordinate the decisions of the municipality to the clan interests.”
The energy comes from the waves, and now comes the big ones
An inexhaustible source of energy that makes up 70 percent of the planet’s surface and is still being discovered by major international energy companies.
Waves, ocean currents, tides, are all a renewable source of energy that giants like Chevron, who are now trying to get their hands on.
In the 1970s, during the first oil crisis, research intensified into the possibility of extracting energy from the sea.
Around 1980, when the price of oil fell, the idea of using marine energy was discarded, but today the demands of environmental protection and the renewed rise in oil prices give new impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity demand could be met by offshore installations.
This is twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there would be currents and tides.
The giants are moving.
Enersis was the first company to commit to offshore energy and in 2005 signed an agreement to build a power plant in northern Portugal.
It seemed like a revolutionary move when the signing was announced.
Two years have passed since then, and more and more companies are opting for marine energy, including some who have been committed supporters of conventional energy.
“Chevron is studying technologies that harness the energy of the oceans and is considering working with us,” a spokesman for the U.S. oil giant’s associate firm, the Wall Street Journal, said in a statement.
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a licence issued by the US Energy Commission for the launch of a project in Alaska for the exploitation of marine energy.
The matter is not insignificant, especially when you consider that the United States is currently extracting oil in Alaska, and President Bush has recently launched a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the New York-based Verdant Power Inc. and the New Jersey-based Ocean Power are on the road to extracting energy from the sea. The amount invested so far, as far as the details are known, shows a growing interest.
The technology is waiting to be developed.
According to experts, this is still a rudimentary technology, not least because the energy from the sea does not dispel doubts about its environmental impact.
Existing facilities such as those in Portugal or Scotland are all small and therefore do not pose a major problem for the ecosystem.
However, in order to produce energy on a larger scale, we need facilities with a greater environmental impact.
There are several options: Ocean Power, for example, uses an interconnected buoy system.
The shocks generated by the waves and moving the buoys up and down are converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders placed in them.
The pressure rotates a turbine, which in turn feeds a generator.
The electricity is transmitted to the land by cables under the sea.
At the moment, there are four similar facilities at the planning stage, which are only waiting for federal approval. Some of the energy produced would be used in a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, has already started generating energy for a shopping mall and a parking lot with six submarine turbines in the East River Strait of New York.
At tide, the movement of the water rotates the blades of the turbines, and this rotational movement feeds the generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of partners who are only waiting for permits to use energy.
Waves followed by tides.
At present, the opportunities to be exploited through the tidal wave deserve special attention.
Although it is a periodic phenomenon, tidal activity is more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and can therefore be considered a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine, Alaska, and other coastal states spent $7.5 million in 2008 to harness the energy of the tides, which is expected to rise to $35 million in 2009.
