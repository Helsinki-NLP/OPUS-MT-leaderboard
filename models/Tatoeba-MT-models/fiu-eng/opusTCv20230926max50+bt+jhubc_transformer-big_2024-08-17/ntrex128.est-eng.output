Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear they will look like the Muppets
Some members of the National Assembly have been dismayed by the suggestion to change their official title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The idea is to change the name of the National Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Representatives of all political orientations in the National Assembly are concerned that this may lead to ridicule.
A Labour member of the National Assembly said his group was concerned because it rhymes with “Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside of Wales, the Welsh word daft means goofy and pwp means poop.
A Plaid member said the group as a whole was “not happy” and had suggested other names.
A member of the Conservative Party of Wales said his group was "receptive" about the name change, but noted that the word "MWP" was very similar to the word "Muppet".
For clarification: in Welsh, the pronunciation of the letter w is similar to the pronunciation of Yorkshire English u.
The National Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting a bill on the name change, said: “The final decision on all the names by which the members of the National Assembly are invited will, of course, be made by the members themselves.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the National Assembly of Wales the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the name proposals, on the basis of which the idea of renaming the National Assembly into the Parliament of Wales is widely supported.
With regard to the official title of the members of the National Assembly, the committee preferred the name "Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMPs", but those who took part in the public poll were most in favour of the "MWP" option.
The members of the assembly are likely to propose other names, but reaching an agreement could prove challenging for Chairman Elin Jones, who is expected to table a bill on the changes in the coming weeks.
The Reform Act also includes other changes in the working principles of the National Assembly, including the rules on disqualification of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
The final vote on the nomination of the members of the National Assembly shall remain the final vote of the members.
Macedonia to hold referendum on changing country name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to rename their country the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is aimed at settling a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province, Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim on this territory and has repeatedly objected to its candidacy for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to a referendum on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
Proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, argue that the name change is just the price the country would pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s bells are silent as churches in Harlem struggle
“Senior people I’ve talked to say there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“There is no longer either one.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People communicate differently today,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people stay every day.”
As far as the churches are concerned, however, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders hope, and “sooner or later, they will be back at the beginning.”
Adams added that churches can be replaced with apartment buildings with apartments full of people who would not lend a helping hand to the remaining churches in the neighbourhood.
“The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings are white,” he added, “who are therefore hastening the day when all these churches will close their doors because it is unlikely that the majority of the people who come to live here will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by White parishes before Harlem became a black metropolis—the Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, St. Martin’s Church ten years later.
The original White Methodist church left in the 1930s.
The black congregation, which had been worshipping nearby, took ownership of the building.
St. Martin’s Church was seized by an African-American congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led a boycott of stores on Harlem’s main shopping street, 125th Street, when they refused to hire or promote blacks.
The building was badly damaged by a fire in 1939, but when members of Father Johnson’s Congregation were planning to rebuild the building, they adopted the carillon or chimes.
Father Johnson’s son and heir apparent at St. Martin’s Church, Reverend David Johnson proudly called the carillon “the watches of the poor.”
But an expert who played the carillon in July gave it a different name: “cultural value” and “an irreplaceable historical tool”.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it is the first carillon in the world played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who 18 years ago continued to play the greater carillon at the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's Church didn't replace him.
What has been played at St. Martin’s Church in recent months has been a story about architects and contractors, some of whom have been involved by the church’s secular leaders, others by the diocese.
In July, the Church presidency, a congregational body made up of secular leaders, complained to the diocese in writing that the diocese was “trying to pass on costs,” although the presidency was not even involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some members of the association complained about the poor transparency of the bishopric’s actions.
California shark injures 13-year-old boy after diving for lobsters
Authorities say a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark while diving for lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy’s cries for help and then swam in with others to help pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, he initially thought the boy was expressing his enthusiasm for catching the lobster, but “then realized that the boy was screaming, ‘I was bitten!
I was bitten!".
His whole collarbone was torn off,” Hammel described the sight he saw when he reached the boy.
“I shouted to everyone to come out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
He was taken by plane to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego.
The species of the shark is still unknown.
Lifeguard and captain Larry Giles told a press conference that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was then determined not to be a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim's injuries were located at the top of the body.
The authorities closed access to Ponto Beach in Ecinitas from Casablanca to Swamin for 48 hours for research and safety purposes.
Giles added that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to take over the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s takes over the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains, creating supermarket-style beauty aisles with expert advisors.
As part of a major push into the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.7 billion beauty market, which continues to rise as fashion and home goods sales decline, wider lines of beauty products are being tested in 11 stores across the country, to be rolled out to other stores next year if successful.
The reason for investing in beauty products is that supermarkets are looking for ways to take advantage of the shelf space previously reserved for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury’s said it plans to double its range of beauty products to 3,000, including for the first time including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw.
Existing product lines from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in brand areas such as those currently found in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also relaunching its make-up line Boutique, in which most of the products are suitable for vegans, as young shoppers demand more and more.
In addition, Fragrance Shop, a perfume retailer, is experimenting with exclusive distribution in two Sainsbury’s stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will open this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Shopping online and switching to small amounts of food from local grocery stores on a daily basis means supermarkets will have to try harder to convince people to visit them.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe has said that outlets will increasingly resemble supermarkets as the supermarket chain seeks to combat low-cost chains such as Aldi and Lidl by providing more services and manufactured goods.
Sainsbury's has put Argos outlets in hundreds of stores. The same has been done with Habitats outlets, as Sainsbury's bought both chains two years ago, which has allegedly supported the sale of groceries and made acquisitions more profitable.
An earlier attempt by the supermarket to upgrade its beauty and treatment departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury experimented with a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but this ended in a dispute over how to share the proceeds from the sale of pharmacy goods in supermarkets.
The new strategy was shaped after Sainsbury’s sold its 281 sons to Celesio, which owns the entire Lloyds Pharmacy retail chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds also plays a role in the strategy by adding luxury skin care products to its four store portfolio, including from brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Operating Officer at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have changed the look and feel of our beauty product aisles to enhance the environment around them for our customers.
We have also spent money on specially trained employees who are always ready to advise.
Our brand selection meets every need. However, the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a competitive beauty trade destination that can change old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones is furious that Holly Willoughby has dropped the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal.
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left in a fit of rage when TV presenter Holly Willoughby dropped an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal in his lifestyle brand business to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby is short of time for the household goods and clothing brand Truly.
The couple’s business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s trademark Goop.
The 37-year-old head of TV show This Morning announced on Instagram that he was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones in a hissing rage, stepping out of their luxury lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on her new successful contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was “angry” when a television star girl testified at a tense meeting held Tuesday at the man’s corporate empire headquarters in Marlows Buckinghamshire that her new contracts worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million meant she didn’t have enough time to dedicate to the household clothing and clothing brand Truly.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was thought to double Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left the UK for one of his holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly was definitely Holly’s main preference.
It was supposed to secure her distant future, so she thought she would be dealing with it for the next few decades.
His decision to leave left everyone completely puzzled.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday because it was so close to the launch of the product line.
Marlow's headquarters has a warehouse full of merchandise for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of This Morning, one of the UK’s most-paid celebrities, could cost the company millions, as a hefty sum of money is invested in products ranging from sofa cushions and candles to clothing and homewear, as well as the later launch of the product.
It could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and his wife Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby formed Truly with Cappi in 2016. Jones, 52, joined the brand as chairman in March.
Couples go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby becomes M&S brand ambassador and replaces Ant McPartlin on ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
One of Jones’s closest sources said last night, “I don’t want to comment on his business affairs.”
A difficult conversation, "after what we fell in love"
Trump joked about criticism directed at him in the news for comments that some deemed “unworthy of the president” and for being overly positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump, in his mocking “news anchor voice,” said:
“I haven’t given up anything.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after Trump welcomed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step toward North Korea’s denuclearization.
However, the negotiations on denuclearisation have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a “corresponding reaction” by the US to North Korea’s initial disarmament steps.
He added that the United States would continue to impose pressure on the country in the future.
Trump’s cheering speech was much more lifelike.
“We’re doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“There was a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Everything is very good between us now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded good results: missile tests have been stopped, hostages have been freed and the relics of American officials have been repatriated.
He also defended his unusual relationship with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside waiting to get into this crowded stadium, it’s better to have nearly 200 people here,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquake destroy Indonesian island, killing hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population had to be relocated, no national disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have often made it very clear that they do not want international assistance, so things are a bit complicated," Ms Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to go to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreigners will be able to work in the area.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, Mr Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu in order to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is surprisingly unprepared to deal with the forces of nature.
Although shelters from the tsunami have been built in Aceh, they are not particularly common in other coastal areas.
Although a tsunami warning was issued, the apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren likely increased the number of deaths in Palus.
Traveling between Indonesia’s numerous islands is quite challenging even at the best of times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship halted in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the new crash site.
President Joko Widodo has made repairing Indonesia's fractured infrastructure a central part of his election campaign and has redistributed money on roads and railways.
However, budget deficits threaten Mr Joko's government, as new elections are to be held next year.
Mr Joko is also under pressure from the sectarians in Indonesia, where members of the majority Muslim community have turned to the more traditional form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands left their homes as a result of street fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs using machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores a draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeating Chelsea in the Premier League by drawing a tie in the 89th minute of the game at Stamford Bridge, London on Saturday.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqir, being approximately 27 meters from Chelsea Gate when his team led 1-0.
He hit the ball to his left before hitting it in the direction of the far post.
The ball flew high over the penalty area and hit the upper right corner of the net.
It fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get in that position, get to the ball, and players like Shaq are pushing the ball as far forward as possible, so I was just trying to win as much time for myself as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming, took one touch and hit him without thinking long enough.”
At the end of the first half, Chelsea led 1-0 thanks to the goal scored by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward pitched the ball back to Mateo Kovacic in that game before turning around in the midfield and pitching to Liverpool's side.
Kovacic made a quick pass in the midfield.
He then created a beautiful aerial feed, leading Hazard to the penalty area.
Hazard missed the defense and hit the ball with his left foot past Liverpool player Alisson Becker towards the far post in the net.
Liverpool will play in the Champions League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Euroleague match on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Death toll in Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster management agency said on Sunday.
A number of people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed as a result of a 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a press conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was buried under collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after stabbing woman to death
The murder investigation began after the body of the woman was found this morning in Merseyside, Birkenhead.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 07:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street, where a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are calling for people who may have seen or heard something in the area to contact them.
Police inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is still at a very early stage, but I would ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and heard or saw anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also ask anyone, particularly taxi drivers, whose onboard cameras may have recorded something, to contact us as they may have vital information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman found in one of the buildings was a local resident of Birkenhead.
This afternoon, alleged friends of the woman came to the scene, asking questions about where the woman was found in the morning.
An investigation is underway and police say they are currently reporting the matter to the woman's close relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews wanted to go back to the apartment, but police told him no one could enter or leave the house.
The man was stunned by the incident.
Residents were told it could take hours to get back into the house.
A police officer reportedly told a man that the entire area was now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman was in tears at the scene.
He kept saying, “That’s terrible.”
At two o’clock in the afternoon, two police buses were still in the closed area, and the third one was right next to it.
A number of police officers stood in the area and watched the apartment building.
Anyone with information about the event is invited to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 using the September 30th log 247 keyword.
Parliament’s Cromwell statue is the last monument to be the cause of the ‘rewriting of history’ controversy
Eliminating it would be poetic justice for the Taliban-style destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts by the man’s inhuman pious followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as foolishness and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was impossible for Oliver Cromwell’s memorial in front of Westminster Palace to remain intact.
Cromwell did not loot the pictures during the English Civil War, nor did he order others to do so.
Perhaps the false Cromwell man's ancestor Thomas was sacrificed for the deeds of the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s excellent presentation of Cromwell is proof of 19th-century opinion and part of the person’s historical description to whom, in the opinion of many people, respect should still be paid.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people saw Cromwell’s parliament as a defender at the end of the 19th rather than a defender today of external pressure and, in this case, of course, of royal power.
Whether this is an accurate reflection is a never-ending historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century strife has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell clearly represents one side of that divide.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and remembered.”
Chinese Farmer Killed by Killer Pig
According to local media reports, in southwestern China, a farmer was attacked by a pig on a market and killed the man.
The man, identified only as Yuan, was found dead and covered in blood in an injured artery near a pig market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China newspaper Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On 30 May 2005, the pig farmer was preparing in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, to vaccinate pigs in his barn.
He and his cousin had reportedly come from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at a market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found that the piglet next door was open.
He said there was a big, bloody hog in the pig song.
Forensic investigation confirmed that the 249.47 kg hog had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were all bloody and crushed,” Wu, the victim’s cousin, told the Guiyang Evening News newspaper.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 04:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so he could not attack anyone else while the police were gathering evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and market leaders are reportedly discussing compensation for the man's death.
Although rare, it has also been observed in the past that pigs attack humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm. The man was seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 294.83 kilograms had nailed a Welsh farmer to a tractor until the man’s wife frightened the animal away.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs don’t usually attack, but because of the taste of blood, they can get very jittery.
“They’re just playful.
They're very inquisitive raccoons who don't want to get hurt.
You just have to respect them enough,” the man said.
Hurricane Rosa’s aftershocks bring heavy rainfall to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is projected to weaken, moving across the northern coast of Mexico toward cooler waters.
Nevertheless, Rosa will bring flooding rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
At 5 a.m. on Sunday morning, with winds blowing at 136.78 kilometers per hour, Rosa was classified as a Category 1 hurricane, located 619.59 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a low pressure is forming over the Pacific Ocean, heading east toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula in a tropical storm on Monday, it begins to channel deep tropical moisture toward the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will arrive in Mexico, where it will rain up to 25.4 centimetres.
Then, the approaching low-pressure reactive tropical humidity in the southwestern part of the country will create extensive heavy rainfall in the coming days.
At times, 2.54 to 10.16 centimetres of rain can cause dangerous flash floods, floodwaters and potential landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes precipitation to increase to five to about seven-and-a-half centimeters per hour, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Also, 5.08 to 10.16 centimeters of precipitation is expected in certain areas of the southwestern United States, especially in Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible due to the dispersal of tropical rains in rapidly deteriorating conditions.
Certainly, one should not walk in the desert in case of the threat of tropical rains.
Heavy rain can cause canyons to turn into fast-flowing rivers, and thunderstorms are accompanied by occasional gusts of wind and volatile dust.
The approaching low pressure will at times result in heavy rainfall along the coast of Southern California.
A total rainfall of more than 1.27 centimetres is possible and may result in less flooding and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain in the region during the rainy season.
Scattered tropical rains begin to approach Arizona late Sunday night and early Monday morning, with heavy rains on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will reach the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, the U.S. is forecasting large temperature fluctuations due to Arctic cooling, while temperatures in tropical areas will remain high.
Sometimes this leads to large temperature changes in small areas.
Sunday’s weather is a great example of significant temperature differences in the central United States.
Temperature differences between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska), as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), reach almost 20 degrees.
In the next few days, the long summer heat will try to gather itself again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm beginning of October with temperatures ranging from 80 degrees Fahrenheit [80<0xC2><0xB0>C] across the southern plains to the northeast.
New York City is expected to have 26.6 degrees of heat on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that there is a likelihood of high average temperatures occurring in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial was watched by more than 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched six TV shows on Thursday that aired compelling confessions of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual violence in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, a political deadlock continued, with broadcasters interrupting conventional broadcasts to cover Friday’s last-minute turns: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake drafted a contract for the FBI to hold a one-week indictment investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh had grabbed her drunk and tried to rip off her clothes at a high school graduation party.
Kavanaugh said in his passionate confession that he was absolutely certain that this did not happen.
More than 20.4 million people watched the broadcast on Friday, according to a Nielsen report.
The company calculated the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels showing it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has trouble calculating the number of people who watch transfers in the authorities.
In comparison, this is about the same size of audience as at the finals of the football tournament or the Oscars.
Opinion leaders on the Fox News Channel, who have been a strong supporter of Kavanaugh’s nomination, ran all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers in a full-day session, Nielsen said.
ABC with 3.26 million viewers came in second place.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high even after the trial.
Flake was the central character in Friday's drama.
After the Office of the Moderate Republican made a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught the man Friday morning, after he had been hit by a mob of protesters trying to get into an elevator to go to a meeting of the Justice Committee.
He stood there for several minutes with his eyes closed when he was accused, and this was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right here in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
He was told, “You have power while so many women are totally powerless.”
Flake said his department issued a statement and added before the elevator closed that he had more to say at the Legal Affairs Committee meeting.
Cable and broadcasting networks broadcast live several hours later when the Legal Affairs Committee had to vote to forward Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate Plenary for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate next week, as demanded by the minority Democrats.
Flake was partially persuaded by a conversation with his friend Senator Chris Coons, Democrat.
After a later conversation with Coons and other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision had an impact, as it was obvious that Republicans would not get Kavanaugh’s votes together without confirmation of the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh’s allegations.
British Prime Minister May Accuses Brexit Critics of Political Gambling
In an interview with the Sunday Times, the prime minister accused those who criticized his plans to leave the European Union of “playing a political game” with Britain’s future and harming the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with a newspaper that featured Theresa May on the cover with former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Johnson pressured his attack on May’s so-called Brexit picket plan, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect tariffs on each other was “totally nonsense.”
Wayde Sims Shot: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson for Murder of LSU Player
Police have arrested a man suspected of shooting 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and jailed on second-degree murder charges, Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson. Police added that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they were carrying Simpson's DNA, a WAFB television channel owned by CBS reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said the man confessed to shooting Wayde dead.
The lawyer said his bail was set at $350,000 ($308,600.30).
An East Baton Rouge coroner released a preliminary report Friday that said a bullet wound to the head in the neck area caused the death.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police’s Refugee Operations Team, the State Police’s Forensic Laboratory, Southern University Police, and residents of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the region’s law enforcement agencies for “taking care and getting justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
A 1.98-meter man grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
The average of his games last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the entire team had been "struck" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"It's something you worry about all the time," Wade said.
Volcano erupts over Mexico City
The ash from a volcano called Popocatepetl has reached the southernmost parts of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano as activity resumed in the crater, which resulted in 183 gas and ash discharges recorded over the course of 24 hours.
The centre was monitored by several noises and tremors.
The images shared on social media depicted ash-covered car windshields in various parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists noticed an increase in the activity of a volcano 72 km southeast of the capital after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police. Thousands joined the anti-protest demonstrations to mark Catalonia's controversial vote to withdraw.
A group of masked disengagement fighters, held back by riot police, attacked the latter with eggs and powder paint, creating thick clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
The fighting also occurred later, when the police had to use clubs to control the fights.
Proponents of independence, who had spent several hours singing "No Forgetting, No Forgiveness," clashed with pro-union protesters chanting "Long live Spain!"
Local media reported that 14 people who suffered minor injuries during the demonstration received medical care.
Tensions remain high in the pro-independence region a year later, when Madrid outlawed the October 1 referendum, but was still celebrated by pro-secession Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, although voter turnout was low, as those who opposed it largely ignored the vote.
Catalan authorities said nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to block voting in front of polling stations across the region, sparking violent clashes.
Pro-independence protesters had stayed in front of polling stations on Friday night to avoid pro-police protests.
There were protests, but they had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a pro-secession rally with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of seeing Catalonia as an independent state.
“Last year we had one of the best moments of our lives.
“I saw my parents crying with joy over the opportunity to vote, but now we are stuck,” he said.
Despite the important but small victory in the regional elections in December last year, it has been difficult for the parties supporting Catalan independence to maintain their will to act this year, as a number of the best-known leaders have either gone into exile themselves or have been detained and are awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who records a protest with her mobile phone to support the police, said the row was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since last year, announced that he will take part in the European Parliament elections next year.
“Candidates to the European Parliament elections are the best way to condemn the withdrawal of democratic values and the pressure exerted by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Man Arrested for Car Crashing House
Three men, ages 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car was repeatedly rammed into the house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. British time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the damage was done to the gates and the building.
It was also possible to shoot a bow towards the car at some point.
Menga's strike gives Livingston a 1–0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston
The promoted Livingston beat the Rangers to lead Steven Gerrard to his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga’s punch proved decisive when Gary Holt raised the level to Hibernian by a second.
Gerrard is undefeated in the first league this season and will face the leading Hearts next Sunday, eight points down.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Euroleague on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston expanded his undefeated attack to seven games, while head coach Holt was still feeling the taste of defeat since Kenny Miler’s replacement last month.
Livingston Loses Opportunity Against Dull Visitors
Holt's team should have been leading long before the goal was scored, as their outspoken style of play caused the Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but his efforts faltered in front of the gate, where Alan Lithgow made an effort to capture Craig Halkett's head shot across the gate.
The hosts calmly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for the guests in certain places.
And this is also how the decisive gate was struck.
The Rangers gave up a free-kick, and Livingston had a chance to play Declan Gallagher, Robinson, and Menga, who took the ball and managed to get it from the center of the penalty area.
By this time, the Rangers had mostly possession of the ball, but were unable to break through the defense, so the side of goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly calm.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos once forced Kelly to defend the gate.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor rebuffed Scott Pittman's shot and Lithgow shined brightly in Livingston's new team effort.
The shots reached Livingston's penalty area continuously and were kicked out of there consistently. Two penalty shots were also sent out, one to Halkett for attempting to replace Glenn Middleton and the other for touching the ball with his hand.
A phenomenal achievement from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Phenomenal performance and result from Livingston.
Each player was excellent, completely surpassing expectations when moving up the ladder.
Their playing style and players have hardly changed since returning to the top level, but Holt must be honored for the way he has tempered the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, organizing a perfectly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their back legs throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
Despite their good standing in the meantime under Gerrard’s leadership, this was not enough according to the examples of the locals.
Their last possession of the ball proved to be incomplete: reaching home only happened once, which could serve as an alarm bell for the Rangers at the center of the table.
Erdogan's controversial reception in Cologne
There were both smiles and clouds of worry in Berlin on Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have been excluded on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police referred to security by banning a crowd of 25,000 members from gathering in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters appeared near it to see their president.
Hundreds of people protesting against Erdogan, many of whom are Kurdish, also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to host the Turkish president in their country.
Fighting demonstrations show that attitudes towards the guest are divided: some Turks in Germany welcome him as a hero, while others despise him as an autocrat.
Road accident on Deptford Road: cyclist killed in car crash
A cyclist who crashed into a car in London was killed.
The collision took place on a high-speed road near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, at about 10:15 a.m. British daylight saving time.
The driver stopped and the ambulance doctors arrived to provide help, but the man died at the scene.
The crash occurred a few months after another cyclist was killed in a collision nearly two kilometres from Saturday’s crash site on Childers Street, where the driver who hit the cyclist fled the scene.
London police said authorities were working to identify the man and inform his loved ones.
At the scene, traffic is closed and buses are diverted, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Prison Officers Injured in Riots
The prison authorities said six prison officers were injured in the riots in a heavily guarded men's prison.
The unrest broke out at Her Majesty’s Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30am British Summer Time on Sunday and has not yet ended.
Expert riot police officers have been involved in dealing with the riots, which have involved eight prisoners.
Prison officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison service spokesperson said: “Specially trained prison staff have been called in to solve an ongoing case at HMP Long Lartin prison.
Five crew members received medical attention due to injuries.
We will not tolerate any violence in our prisons, those responsible will be handed over to the police and their sentences may be extended.”
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was taken to hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, however, the riot police were called to prison to try to calm a serious unrest in which prison officials were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash floods (Drought areas may benefit from the hurricane)
Tropical depression doesn’t hit Arizona often, but it’s likely to happen early next week when the languishing hurricane Rosa moves across the desert in the southwest of the United States, bringing with it the threat of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already arranged to monitor flash floods Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, California and southeastern Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to the forecast, Rosa will head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the area as early as Monday with heavy rains.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted: “Since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or low pressure levels within a radius of 321.86 kilometers from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed within 64.37 kilometers of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict a rainfall of 5.08 to 10.16 centimeters, which can reach up to 15.24 centimeters in the restricted areas of Mogollon Rimi, Arizona.
In other desert areas of the American Southwest, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, rainfall is likely to range from 2.54 to 5.08 centimeters, reaching up to 10.16 centimeters in restricted areas.
Rainfall can be a blessing for areas suffering from sudden floods, as the area is suffering from drought.
While the floods are very concerning, such rainfall is also likely to be beneficial as there is a drought in southwestern America.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, at least 40% of Arizona's population is in extreme drought, the second-largest category, according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa Baja crosses the California Peninsula on the Mexican mainland.
Rosa, which was still at hurricane-level on Sunday morning with the highest winds of 6.43 kilometers per hour, is now 619.95 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19.31 kilometers per hour.
The storm comes into contact with the cooling waters of the Pacific Ocean and therefore subsides slightly.
Rosa is expected to arrive on the Mexican mainland with a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or afternoon.
The amount of rainfall in certain areas of Mexico can be high, bringing with it a significant risk of flooding.
"From Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, rainfall can be expected in the range of 7.62 to 15.24 centimetres in total, reaching up to 25.4 centimetres in some places," weather.com reported.
Rosa then heads north across Mexico in a tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that travels across Arizona and reaches southern Utah late Tuesday night.
“The main threat following Rosa or its aftermath is very heavy rainstorms in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the desert in the southwest U.S.,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These torrential rains can cause life-threatening flash floods and floodwaters in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests in connection with attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of premeditated murder after a 16-year-old boy with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at 4 a.m. British daylight saving time on Sunday.
The victim was taken to hospital in a “stable” condition.
A 17-year-old, 18-year-old and 20-year-old man was arrested at night in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset, police said.
Officials are asking to contact anyone who may have cell phone records of the incident.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'suffered' from Democratic Party 'evil and hate'
“Supporting Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party’s merciless and unacceptable tactics,” Trump said in a speech in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered “evil and hatred” during the Democratic Party’s inauguration process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vehemently and emotionally rejecting allegations by Christine Blasey Ford that he attacked her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also issued a statement at the hearing about his allegations.
The president said Saturday that "America saw Kavanaugh's glory, quality and courage that day."
“The vote to appoint Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to appoint one of the most respected lawmakers of our time, with an impeccable background in public service,” he said.
The president indirectly referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of the Republic's voter turnout in the mid-term elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
“I’m not running, but I’m running,” he said.
That’s why I’m everywhere to fight for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats were on a mission to “stand up and stop.”
The first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh's candidacy on the Senate floor is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican party leader's aide told CNN.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have killed thousands, death toll rises
At least 384 people were killed and many washed away when giant waves hit the beach after a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in Palu on Friday, when six-meter waves hit the beach, killing a number of people and destroying everything on the road.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still doing their thing on the beach rather than running away immediately, remaining victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency, told a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it took cars, logs and houses with it, wiping everything off the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving offshore at a speed of 800km/h before reaching shore.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to the Palu 24 centre.
Air photos published by the Disaster Management Agency showed a number of destroyed buildings and shops, shattered and collapsed bridges and water-walled mosques.
The raids on the coast continued on Saturday.
There were waves of earthquakes in the region of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released on Friday following a strong earthquake was nearly 200 times that of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, located along a long and narrow bay, may have increased the strength of the tsunami, BPPT said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be higher in a coastal area 300 km north of Palus called Donggala, which was closer to the quake's center.
The reports from Donggala “are completely incomplete and do not contain any information,” Nugroho said.
"The region has a population of over 300,000," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its team and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“This is a tragedy that could get worse,” he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for failing to report a tsunami in the city of Palu, although authorities said the waves reached the beach at the same time the warning was issued.
Amateur images on social media show a man on the top floor of a building panickingly warning people on the street below of an approaching tsunami.
Minutes later, the water wall reaches the beach, carrying houses and cars with it.
Reuters was not able to confirm the authenticity of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a large-scale power outage, hampering communications in the Palu region and making it difficult for authorities to organise rescue operations.
The military has begun sending transport planes from Jakarta and other cities to provide assistance, authorities said, but the evacuations are still in dire need of food and other essentials.
The airport in the city was reopened for rescue operations, remaining otherwise closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit the evacuation centres on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to more than 800.
This is very bad.
While World Vision employees from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where they are sheltered in the tarpaulins erected in their office courtyard, they saw devastating sights along their way, Mr. Doseba said.
“They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
This is very bad.
Although relief efforts were vigorously initiated, some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive experience were prevented from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian rules, foreign funding, supplies and reinforcements can only be sent when the crash site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster at provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can start accepting international aid, but it hasn’t been announced yet.”
When the second night of the Palus came after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and families of the missing people were still full of hope that their loved ones would be those miraculous occurrences that would lighten the gloom of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman trapped under the rubble of her mother’s body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia’s national team of gliders, trained the two missing gliders for the Asian Games, which took place in Indonesia earlier this month.
The rest of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel are his students, Mr Mandagi added.
“As a senior skydiver, I have a personal burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon spoke about how, after the news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse spread among the glider community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu’s competitors who were at the beach festival.
His messages, however, were marked with only one grey tick instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means the messages didn’t get through,” he said.
Thieves claimed €23,585.88 while cashing in an ATM at Newport on the Levees
On Friday morning, thieves stole €23,585.88 from a Brink employee at the Newport on the Levees ATM, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver emptied an ATM at an entertainment center and prepared to bring in more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
When the man acted, “another man ran behind Brink’s employee” and stole a delivery bag full of money.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, a press release said, but police did not specify the number of people involved.
Anyone with information about the early victims is asked to contact the Newport Police Department by phone at +01633) 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper will change his name to Ye
Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
In a tweet announcing the change on Saturday, he wrote, "Former Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time, and the name was also used as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change comes ahead of his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled her concert “in the name of emotion,” the show’s author said.
In addition to being an acronym for the man’s current stage name, West has previously said that it is a word of religious importance to him.
“I think ‘ye’ is one of the most commonly used words in the Bible, which means ‘you’ there,” West said earlier, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“I am you, I am you, I am you.
I changed my name from Kanye, which means “the one,” to Ye, which is just a reflection of our good and bad, our confusion, and everything else.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye West is not the only rapper to play under his own name.
Sean Combs is primarily known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year the musician announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
Jay-Z, who previously collaborated with West, has also used his name with and without a dash, capitalized and lowercase letters.
Mexican politician AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
As the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody attacks on students, Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador vowed at the Tlatelolco Plaza on Sunday that he would "never use the military to contain the Mexicans."
The military attacked a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were rallying across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by paying monthly grants to students and opening more free state universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young people towards criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
“As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount allocated to research in this field,” said Kai-Fu Lee, a financier and AI specialist who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were published after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about artificial intelligence, although the U.S. does not have an official strategy on artificial intelligence in general.
At the same time, China last year unveiled its plan to be a player in the renewal of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Dualning the AI research budget would be a good start, given that other countries are so far behind the U.S., and we are working towards the next AI breakthrough," Lee said.
Double funding would double the likelihood of the next major AI achievement in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinnovation Ventures, which funded one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with an artificial intelligence system that defeated America's best Othello player. He later served on the board of Microsoft Research and was president of Google's China branch.
Lee recognized technology competitions from the previous U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would be held to help identify future dreamers.
“U.S. scientists have to work hard to get government funding,” Lee said.
“China is not taking over the intellectuals, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired brilliant scientists from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. support AI efforts.
“I think people with a PhD in artificial intelligence should automatically be offered a green card,” he said.
China’s State Council published its next-generation AI development plan in July 2017.
“The National Science Foundation of China distributes funding to people working in academic institutions similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government agencies allocate funds to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Unified Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to engage partners from both industry and educational institutions. The White House, however, announced the formation of an artificial intelligence select committee.
Earlier this month, DARPA announced it was funding a $2 million AI Next initiative.
But the National Science Foundation is currently funding over $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not been amended.
Macedonia to vote on changing country name in referendum
Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to change the country’s name to the Republic of North Macedonia on Sunday, a move that would also settle a decades-long dispute with Greece over its refusal to confirm Macedonia’s EU and NATO membership applications.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour is a requirement for this territory and has banned Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on a new name for Macedonia, but nationalist opponents argue that the name would damage the national identity of the Macedonian Slav majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he did not intend to take part in the referendum and that the campaign of irregularities had raised doubts as to whether turnout would reach the 50% required for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum asks: “Do you support Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU by agreeing to an agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to ensure Macedonia, one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, joins organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of our country and for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protective hands of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgiyevska, 79, who voted in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have said that they will follow the result of the vote in order to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament is needed to change the name.
The National Electoral Committee said that as of 1:00 p.m., there were no reports of irregularities.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the 2016 parliamentary election, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko, voted in a referendum on 30 September 2018 to change the name of the country, which would give them the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage, raising chairs in front of tents for those who ignored the referendum.
“We want to belong to NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not through the door of the servants,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and get from Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring the necessary investments to Macedonia with an unemployment rate of over 20%.
“I believe that a large majority is in favour of changing the name, as more than 80 percent of citizens are in favour of belonging to the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He said that a “yes” would be a “confirmation of our future.”
The results of a poll published by the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies on Monday revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters intend to take part in the referendum, which is below the required voter turnout.
A poll conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV revealed that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would say yes.
The success rate of the referendum is 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the Western policy of the government since it took over in May last year.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes all the way to Brighton for the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through Brighton's defence, securing a 2–0 win for Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, on Saturday.
Aguero looked like the goal he scored in his 65th minute came ridiculously easily.
The Argentine striker passed the midfield at the beginning of the order.
He broke through three of Brighton's defenders before reaching the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He broke through another defender before running past several players on the edge of the Brighton Penalty.
He then hit the ball to his left, where Sterling was.
An English striker used the first strike to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to strike Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a blow to the right of the net.
“Aguero has leg problems,” Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We said he was going to play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at that point.”
However, Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues an initial head start in the Premier League battle.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in this game clearly in the territory of Brighton.
He sent the ball nicely from the air to Leroy Sane on the left side.
Sane hit the ball a few times before leading Sterling farther.
Sky Blues pushed the ball into the net just before it slipped out of bounds.
Manchester City will play in the Champions League with Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at Rhein-Neckar Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies.
When the Nationals missed the finals, there was little reason for a fresh start.
Scherzer hopes to take down the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if Rockies, who leads the Los Angeles Dodgers in one game at NL West, still has a chance to make it to the final.
The Rockies guaranteed at least a wildcard position with 5-2 wins over the Nationals on Friday night, but the team still wants to secure their first division position.
“While we’re not playing for anything, we can at least try, knowing that playing in the atmosphere here with the audience and the other team in Denver is probably at a higher level than any other game that I can expect this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete here?”
The Nationals have yet to name a striker for Sunday, but are reportedly leaning toward Scherzer’s pass in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th feeding, did a warming-up session on Thursday and fed on Sunday as usual.
This Washington right-handed player draws 18–7, his ERA is 2.53, the number of kicks is 300 and the favorable odds are 220 2/3 this season.
Trump to give speech in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh's election to the Supreme Court, while talking about the importance of the Republic's voter turnout in the mid-term elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before the most important election of our lifetime.
It's a big event and I'm not running, but I'm actually running, so I'm here everywhere to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrible, extremely horrible extremist group of Democrats. You see it happening in front of your own eyes.
And they have decided to take back power by any means. You can see their vicious and dirty game.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over for power and control, the only thing they want is power and control over everything, and we're not giving it to them."
The Democrats are on a mission to “stand up and prevent.”
“And you’ve seen that in the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “angry, evil, vile and lying.”
He referred by name to Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who shouted down in the audience.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak that document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, um, no, wait, that was one of the worst body language examples, actually the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a big party.
It is intolerant of those who express their opinion
When activists from my local party, Momentum, voted to condemn me, it was not very surprising.
After all, I am the last on the list of Labour Members to be told that you are not welcome, and all for expressing my opinion.
My colleague from Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way because she stood up strongly for anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was condemned by the critics for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Responsible economic policy, national security and European affairs, which are strangely similar issues on which Jeremy also disagreed with previous leaders.
A statement from the Nottingham East Labour Party said: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and creative.”
For the most part, my eight years of experience as a local Labour Member with Friday evening assembly meetings is exactly that.
Unfortunately, as of today, this no longer holds true for most meetings, and the promise of being “kinder and more generous” in politics has long since been forgotten, if ever remembered.
It is becoming more and more obvious that different viewpoints are not acceptable in the Labour Party, and in each opinion it is assessed who is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
It started right after Jeremy became the leader, and the co-worker with whom I thought I shared similar political views in the past was now waiting for me to change my mind and adopt positions that I would otherwise never have accepted, whether it was issues of national security or the EU’s single market.
Whenever I make a public statement, no matter what I actually say, it is followed by condemnation on social media, inciting my recall, ignoring party politics, and saying that I should not belong to the Labour Party.
And it's not just my personal experience.
Indeed, I know that I have been more fortunate than some of my co-workers, as the comments directed at me are mostly political.
I admire the competence and judgment of those co-workers who face sexist or racist abuse every day but never give up.
One of the most disappointing views of this policy area is how levels of abuse have become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is, however, that we are no longer such a big community, and with every “unreliability” initiative or change in election rules, the party becomes narrower.
I’ve been given a lot of advice over the last two years to keep my head down, talk less, and “that’s all right.”
But that’s not what I came into politics to do.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, motivated by Thatcher’s government’s negligence, which had left my large school classroom literally on the brink of collapse, I have sought to speak up for better public services for those who need it most, both as a member of the local council and as a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, including in the last election.
There is no way that anyone in Nottingham East got confused about my political views or areas of disagreement with local management.
To all those who promoted the movement on Friday, I would like to say that, as the country is moving towards a Brexit that damages households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend my time and energy in loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: The undefeated Ayr moves to the top
The two late events may have tilted the end result somewhat, but there’s no doubt that Ayr deserves to win this wonderfully fun first league match of the Tennent.
They are now the only undefeated team in the top ten.
In the end, it was the team’s high level of protection and better risk-taking that led to the home team’s victory, and coach Peter Murchie has every right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been put to the test all along the game and we’re still invincible, so of course I’m happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “I think of Ayr, they used their opportunities better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was taken over by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr a head start, but the yellow card given to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was surrendered by the Warriors for the game, gave Melros a chance where Jason Baggot made a failed attempt.
Climo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty shot just before the end of the half, scoring 17–5 in favour of Ayr at the end of the half.
But Melrose started the second half successfully, and Patrick Anderson's test, which was taken over by Baggot, narrowed the gap by five points.
There was then a long delay due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, after which the man was taken away on a stretcher. As the game continued, Ayr further increased his lead thanks to an attempt by Stafford McDowall, broadcast by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blair Macpherson, was then on the yellow card, but once again, Melrose's player Bruce Colvine paid for the failed transmission after heavy pressure.
The home field team, however, regained strength and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for impeding Climo without a ball on the penalty line, MacPherson put the ball behind the advancing Ayrs.
Climo passed the ball, as he did almost immediately after resuming the game, when Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong boxing and sent off flank guard Gregor Henry on the fifth try of the home field team.
Still Game Star Wants to Start a New Career in the Restaurant Industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems poised to step into the hospitality industry after discovering he was named director of a renowned restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the well-known BBC television series he writes for and co-stars with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last in the series, and it seems Kiernan is making new plans for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan wanted to enter Glasgow's "flourishing restaurant business".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, without sea borders, hopes the court will open the way for them to the Pacific Ocean again
Marines are patrolling the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Ocean blue flags are flying over the buildings of the authority.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon bear the motto: “The sea is our right.
It is our responsibility to restore it.”
In Bolivia, completely without sea borders, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody resource conflict of the 19th century is still alive. The same vivid desire to sail again on the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the highest in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the ruling of the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of negotiations.
“Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and calm, and the country naturally expects a positive outcome,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
A number of Bolivians across the country are watching the ruling of the International Court of Justice from the big screens, hoping that the Hague Court will decide in favour of Bolivia, after which Chile will be obliged to negotiate with Bolivia, after decades of fragmentary discussions, in order to give the latter an independent way to the sea.
Bolivia’s charismatic native President Evo Morales, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, has much at stake in Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
Some analysts, however, believe that the court will probably not vote in favour of Bolivia, or that very little would change.
The UN authority in the Netherlands does not have the power to give up Chilean territory, and it has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the ruling comes just six months after hearing the final statements suggests it wasn’t a “difficult case,” said Paz Zárate, an expert in international law in Chile.
And moving away from Bolivia's additional causes may have worsened the situation over the past four years.
“The problem of access to the sea has been robbed by the current Bolivian authorities,” Zárate said.
Morales’ bellicose eloquence has lost the goodwill of the rest of Chile, he noted.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at some point, but after all this, the debate will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, who is Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unnecessarily quick.
Monday will give Bolivia a “extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in its relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “end 139 years of conflict with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most prominent presidents, uses the issue of the sea as an expression of political resentment.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says it will not denuclearize until it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be the first to give up nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to review the promises made to each other by rival leaders during the Singapore summit.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo almost seems to be resuming his deadlocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
According to Ri, these are castles in the air, believing that the US’s continued restrictions and refusal to declare an end to the war with Korea will cause North Korea to surrender.
Washington will be wary of such a statement unless Pyongyang takes the first important steps toward disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang intends to seriously abandon armaments, which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its own safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to set up a second Kim-Trump summit.
Parisian fashion shows bring a series of massive headwear to the viewer, brought to shoppers on their neighborhood shopping streets
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, you no longer have to look.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne brought a series of bizarre extra-large headwear to the stage during their 2019 summer season, dazzling Paris Fashion Week.
High and impractical hats are in fashion this summer via Instagram, and these designers have sent their stunning creations to the runways.
Valentino’s top piece was an oversized beige hat covering the heads of the models, which was decorated with a wide border reminiscent of feathers.
Other very large items of clothing included jeweled watermelons, a wizard’s hat, and even pineapple, but they were not designed to insulate the head.
Thom Browne also showed a strange selection of masks, doing it just in time for Halloween.
Most of the colorful masks had sewn mouths, so they resembled Hannibal Lecter more than they did in high fashion.
One part of the creation resembled a diving suit with an air tube and glasses, while the other resembled a melted ice cream puff.
And if you continue with the giant fads, you're in luck.
Fashion gurus predict that super-sized headgear can also reach the shopping streets near you.
The extra-large hats immediately follow La Bomba, a 60-centimeter-wide straw hat that has been seen on the heads of celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that created the largely impractical hat that was thrown into social media sent another big piece to the runways – a straw beach bag that is almost as big as the model wearing it with a bikini.
A dark orange raffia bag with raffia fringes and a white leather handle was the highlight of Jacquemus La Riviera’s 2019 summer collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing the big hats and beach bags on the shopping streets next summer. Since the designer has made such an impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for super-sized clothing.”
John Edward: Language skills are important for global citizens
Scottish private schools have remained at the forefront of academic excellence and continued to do so in 2018 with the next outstanding exam results, reinforced by personal and collective success in sports, arts, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland and represented by the Council of Scottish Private Schools (SCIS), these schools strive to provide the best service to their students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, for their chosen profession, and for their place as world citizens.
As an education sector that is able to design and implement a curriculum adapted to the circumstances, we can see that modern languages continue to be well-known and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it comes to his head.
If you talk to him in his language, it will reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can see that at the top of the tables are the languages with the highest exam completion rates among private schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a high score of A.
Data collected from a total of 74 SCIS schools show that 72 percent of students received an A in Mandarin, 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners, and 63 percent of Spanish learners.
This shows that Scottish private schools support foreign languages as a vital life skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages, which are now among the subjects of choice, are included in the curricula of private schools and other schools in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that 17% of respondents identified a lack of language skills as one of the reasons why employers have difficulty finding workers for vacancies.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future jobs.
To the extent that more desirable job offers require language skills, such skills are becoming essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career choice made, acquiring a second language will give a person a real advantage in the future, since language skills are lifelong.
Being able to communicate directly with foreign citizens gives a multilingual person an immediate competitive advantage.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent of respondents did not speak any foreign language well enough to have a conversation about it. The only language with a two-digit percentage of proficients was French with 15 percent.
Therefore, the funding of language learning is important for today’s children at this time.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those of emerging economies, gives children a better chance of finding a good job.
Different languages are taught in every school in Scotland.
A number of schools tend to focus on classical modern languages, while other schools teach languages that are considered the most important in the UK for 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the child’s interests, private schools always have the opportunity to choose between several languages taught by experts in their field.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares and equips children with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds for them.
It can no longer be denied that, in a globalising business environment, languages are crucial to a country’s future and must therefore also be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be regarded as ‘international communication skills’.
Private schools continue to provide young Scots with choice, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
LeBron to make Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday
Avid fans no longer have to wait to see LeBron James make his debut at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play the Denver Nuggets in the opening game of the season in San Diego on Sunday.
However, the number of minutes of play remains to be determined.
“That’s over one and under 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play for a number of minutes.
After training last week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game pre-season schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to warm up,” he said.
Trump's West Virginia Election Campaign Event, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump will begin his campaign events tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump’s first of five campaign events scheduled for next week, including stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote will stand until Trump elects whom to appoint to the Supreme Court’s vacant seat, he will seek to increase support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans are threatened with losing control of Congress following a November vote.
What time will Trump’s campaign event take place tonight in West Virginia, and how will it be viewed online?
Trump’s campaign event in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place Saturday night, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 p.m. East Coast Time.
Trump’s campaign event in West Virginia can be viewed online via YouTube streaming.
Trump is likely to speak about this week’s hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which became tense over allegations of sexual misconduct. Meanwhile, a Senate confirmation vote has been suspended for a week while the FBI investigates the matter.
But the main goal of the campaign events series is to help reinvigorate the Republicans, who will face a difficult election in November.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign manager said that the goal of these five events over the next week is to “encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to defend and expand their Senate and House majority,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so important to the president’s agenda that Trump will be diving into as many states as possible during the fast-paced campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Tonight’s campaign event, scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, could draw supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage in the Pittsburgh media,” West Virginia Metro News reported.
This is the second time Trump has visited West Virginia in the past month, a state where he received more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Senator Patrick Morrisey, a Republican from West Virginia, who is in charge of the polls.
"For Morrisey, it's not a good sign that the president is here to boost his performance," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, said in a statement.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team has nerve to compete, keeping hopes high ahead of Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon’s games may have been just what Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pivot pendulum is a completely fictional concept in sports, but players truly believe in it, especially in competitions like this one.
Where do you think the turning point is now?
“They led with six points, which is now four, so I think I can take that as a bit of a turning point,” Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has the advantage, that is clear, because it is led by four points and there are 12 more points in the game.
According to Spieth, the Americans feel they don’t have enough wind in the sails, but they have a lot of encouragement, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each got three out of four points.
Spieth has been stunning in both tee and green and sets an example.
These shouts of victory from the throat became louder with each round, overshadowing the decisive putt that would have led to a draw in the fourth match after he and Thomas were down by two.
His putt, which won the match on the 15th, sent a similar exclamation that showed the man’s belief that the Americans were not yet out of the race.
“You just have to play more focused and worry about your match,” Spieth said.
That’s all the players can do.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed stars of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s strange but beloved couple are four out of four and nothing can go wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only couple who didn’t hit bogeys on Saturday afternoons, avoiding bogeys also on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and butt nine Friday mornings.
This game, and the way their energy flows into and out of such a noisy crowd, reinforces the view that the players who will be competing on Sunday, and that when the sun sets over Le Golf National, there will be no better-known player than Fleetwood or Molinari to confirm a possible European victory.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, talk of European glories is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a quick job with Sergio Garcia, this morning's four-ball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and the two doubles in the first nine dug a hole so deep for the Spaniard and the Swede that they had no hope of digging their way out of it.
But on Saturday, there's no one to get you out of that hole.
Four-balls and doubles are extremely fascinating to watch up close because of the communication between couples, advice given to each other, unreceived advice, and how a way can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken the lead by the last day with a strong lead, but this quadrangle session showed that the US team has a nerve to fight that some, especially the Americans, have doubted.
Europe to lead Ryder Cup 10–6 on final day
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe will have a good lead, leading the United States 10–6 after Saturday’s four-ball and even games.
The great duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories ahead of the struggling Tiger Woods to raise their current score at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, which contributed to the preservation of the Cup lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American side in the morning four-ball, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in doubles, winning two games, but they couldn’t make up for the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points to keep the trophy from Sunday's 12 singles.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row. Together with Molinar, who is called Molliwood after this fun weekend, they are the second couple to have won four points in their four opening games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
Having destroyed Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they continued in the same vein, defeating Woods and American novice Bryson Dechambeauveel more firmly: 5–4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed a random shine, but has now lost his 29 four-ball and 19 doubles, losing seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested for the morning four-ball, returned with partner Henrik Stenson to doubles, beating 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are in first and third place in the world rankings.
Europe did not succeed, although the race was held in pleasant and windy weather south of Paris.
Three-time world champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas scored two points on Saturday.
They beat Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter 2–1 in four-ball, returning later and beating Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in doubles, losing two openings.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team has come back from a four-point deficit, going into single games, although as owners, Furyk only needs a draw to maintain the Cup.
Although being in second place for two days, after the counterattack on Sunday, it seems that they will not succeed.
North Korea says ‘no way’ it will not disarm unilaterally due to lack of confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued restrictions had deepened its distrust of the United States and that it would not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
At the annual meeting of the World Organization, Ri Yong Ho said North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile testing, dismantling a nuclear test site, and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see the United States responding to that," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, our country lacks security, and under these circumstances we are in no way willing to disarm ourselves unilaterally.”
While Ri reiterated familiar complaints about North Korea’s resistance to Washington’s “gradual” approach to denuclearization, on the basis of which North Korea would be rewarded for taking gradual steps, his statement seemed significant that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to move towards “the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” and Trump promised security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls for a relaxation of strict international restrictions on North Korea.
"The United States will demand the 'first to lay down nuclear weapons' and will increase the pressure on the restraints to achieve their goal forcibly, even opposing a declaration of end to the war," Ri said.
“The realization that restrictions are putting us on our knees is a dream for people who don’t know us at all.
But the problem is that the continuing restrictions are exacerbating our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader highlighted earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If South Korea, rather than the US, were one of the parties to the nuclear arms issue, the issue of the Korean Peninsula’s nuclear armament would not have reached such a deadlock.”
Nevertheless, Ri’s speech was sharply different from last year’s when he told the UN General Assembly that a North Korean approach to the US mainland with missiles was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to completely destroy North Korea last year at the United Nations, praised Kim for his courage to take steps toward disarming, but added that there was still much to be done and that the restrictions must remain in place until North Korea’s denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t have a schedule for it, saying, “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months — it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “Enforcement of the Security Council’s restrictions must continue forcefully and without fail until we can fully and definitively confirm the denuclearization process.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased restrictions on North Korea in an attempt to block funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Riga next to the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, although the last trip did not go very well.
Following his July meeting with Pyongyang, he said that progress had been made, after which North Korea condemned him for "gangster-like demands" in just a few hours.
North Korea said at a meeting with Moon this month it would dismantle the missiles and nuclear complex if the United States took “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim had told him that by “appropriate measures” he meant Trump’s promised security guarantees in Singapore and a move toward normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn how to get enough rest
This year, Harvard University is offering a new course where students need more sleep to combat a growing aggressive culture of learning through caffeine-rich night-long learning marathons.
Students who love the academic quality of the best university in the world are often helpless when it comes to the basics of taking care of themselves.
According to Charles Czeisler, a sleep doctor at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, this is the first of its kind in the United States.
He inspired the creation of the course after giving a talk on how sleep disorders affect learning.
“At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I only being told this now, in my last year of school?’
He said no one had ever told him the importance of sleep — it baffled me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which first appeared on the curriculum this year, explains to students how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic outcomes and also help improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of health at the university, said the university decided to take a course curriculum after it was found that students were severely sleep deprived during the work week.
The one-hour course involves a number of interacting tasks.
There, students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes, and books, and are explained about the effects of caffeine and light on how lack of sleep affects athletic performance and the importance of the habit of going to bed.
The second part explains how a prolonged lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interacting symbols encourages participants to reflect on their day-to-day established practice.
“We know that this does not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know — just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” Professor Czeisler added.
According to him, there is still pride in night-time learning marathons, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation is still a growing problem.
“Providing enough quality sleep should be a student’s ‘secret’ to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety,” he added. “It even helps with weight gain, as lack of sleep puts the brain into a starvation mode, making a person constantly hungry.”
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical biology from California, helped create a course for Professor Czeisler, having attended one of his classes in his previous, his first year at Harvard.
Raymond said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to contribute to the creation of a university-wide course.
As a next step, he wants all graduate students to complete a similar program of study before joining a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set an alarm clock for both going to bed and waking up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” produced by electronic screens and LED lighting, as this can damage their circadian rhythm and cause problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's Gate defeats Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another poor guest score when Dolly Menga, flanked by Steven Gerrard, scored a 1–0 victory for Livingston.
The Ibrox side had hoped to get their first away win since February, when they defeated 4-1 St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as manager, eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership manager Hearts.
Menga scored his goal seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers' poor readiness never recovered.
The Rangers thus fall to sixth place, with Livingston rising to third, beating Hibernian by just one goal.
For the Rangers, the problems may not be over yet, as their forward, Calum Spence, needed a head wound treatment after he was hit by an apparently discarded object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side leading up to the Ayr and Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, went ahead with the same Liv 11 that took the point from Hearts last week, and he would have been pleased with the way his well-trained boys suffocated their opponents every step of the way.
The Rangers may have dominated the village, but Livingston did much more with his ball.
They should have scored the goal in the second minute when Menga's first-rounder sent Scott Pittman through the Allan McGregor goal, but the midfielder didn't take his chance.
A deep Keaghan Jacobs free-kick was then found by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow was only able to make a wide-arch shot to the rear post.
The Rangers took control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in the last third of their game.
Alfredo Morelos felt confident that he should have received a penalty kick when he ran into Steven Lawless in the 15th minute, with Judge Steven Thomson not accepting the Columbia player's complaint.
The Rangers scored only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not worried about Lassana Coulibaly's head start or Ovie Ejaria's event.
While the 34-minute kick-off of Liv may have broken the rules of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it purely for their performance.
Again, the Rangers couldn't contain Jacobs' deep, heavy performance.
Scott Arfield didn’t react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept the peace and chose Menga, who just finished the plan.
Gerrard acted during the intermission, trading Coulibaly for Ryan Kent. This exchange almost paid off when the winger split Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed out of his seat.
But Livingston continued to entice guests to play the exact type of game that suits them, where Lithgow and Halkett picked up long balls.
The Holt side could have advanced from their lead in the final stage, but McGregor stood firm, blocking Jacobs before Lithgow hit the big arch from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton requested another penalty kick when he went down with Jacobs, which Thomson again refused.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and counting... the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
From that foundation of science, the Geiger counter also became the bedrock of pop culture as in the 1950 film Coronado’s Bells, starring these seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
By wearing these headphones, you can hear the sound of atoms emitted from the radioactivity of the minerals."
Evans: "Don't tell me, it's still rustling!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Immune System to 'See' Scammer Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Cheater Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Know Scammer Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory
They can then “see” a common protein for many cancers and are injected back into the body.
The study vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches her immune system to detect rogue cells had her ovarian cancer cleared for more than 18 months.
The method involves the removal of immune cells from the patient. These cells are modified in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein that has spread to various HER2 cancers, and then these cells are injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, explained: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “controls the growth of many types of cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, where immune cells are taken from patients and taught to target cancer cells, has been used to treat some types of leukaemia.
Kanye West started out as a supporter of Trump, wearing a MAGA hat on SNL live.
That didn't go very well.
In the studio for Saturday Night Live, a pejorative whistle-blower addressed Kanye West, following his confusingly delivered speech in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced his candidacy for the same post in 2020.
After performing his third song that night, Ghost Town, where he wore a hat with the letter “Make America Great,” he began to rant against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I’ve talked to so many white people asking me, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
“If I had been so worried about racism, I would have moved away from America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL started the device with Matt Damon, where Hollywood celebrity made fun of Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in connection with Christine Blasey Ford’s alleged sexual assault.
While this episode did not air, West’s noisy footage was uploaded to comedian Chris Rock’s social media.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to mock West's post.
West also complained to the audience that he was having a pretty hard time behind the scenes with his hat on.
“They made fun of me backstage.
They told me not to go in there with my hat on.
They made fun of me!
And then they'll say I'm in a drowned place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “You want to see a sunken place? I put on my Superman cape because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try it with love.”
His comments sparked viewers' outrage on at least two occasions and seemed to embarrass the SNL team. According to Variety, one person published: “The entire studio remained silent until death.”
West had been introduced at the last minute to replace Ariana Grande, as the singer's ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West amazed many with the song "I Love It", which, during its performance, he looked like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: “To one brave soul: THANK YOU FOR COURAGEING AGAINST THE PEOPLE.”
But host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just “who she is, and it’s absolutely amazing.”
“But I chose NOT to reward (by buying my music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’) someone who, in my opinion, believes in and spreads a worldview that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Just like us," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now “ex-Kanye West.”
She is not the first singer to change her stage name following Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Also, rapper Snoop Dogg has gone by the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the recently departed musical legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol.
Attempted murder charge in Belfast restaurant stabbing
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
According to police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrate's Court on Monday.
The case will be examined by the public prosecutor’s office.
Game of Thrones celebrity Kit Harington does not approve of the fangs' masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his flashing sword role as Jon Snow in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the actor (31) debunks the stereotype of an aggressive hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel the need to be tough.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit thought “something has gone wrong” and raised the question of how to solve the problem of awesome masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married her Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie (31), admitted to feeling “quite strongly” that this issue needed attention.
“I feel pretty strongly right now that we’ve gone wrong with masculinity somewhere,” he said.
“What have we taught men as they grow up about the problem we see now?”
Kit believes that television is partly to blame for the fawn’s rise to masculinity, as it shows supermanly characters.
He continued: “What is inborn and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets gives young boys the feeling that they have to be just the way they want to be men.
I think this is really one of the biggest issues of our time - how to change it?
Something has gone wrong with the boys.”
In the poll, he also admitted that after the series ends next summer, he will never participate in any of the sequels of the Game of Thrones, saying that he is "one sided with his battlefields and horses."
Since November, Kit Sam Shepard is involved in the revival of True West, which tells the story of the filmmaker and his kidnapper brother.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose to be the best thing about Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on this show, so it gave me my future family and my future life,” she said.
Rose played Ygritte in the Emmy-winning fantasy series, beloved by Kit's character Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS has soared to 14%.
According to health professionals, more than 820,000 people suffer from this disease.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, around 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most new cases have arisen from sex, thus changing the past.
In some parts of China , HIV was indigenously spread by infected blood transfusions .
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way had dropped to almost zero, Chinese health officials confirmed at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year by year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but the distinction between LGBT people is said to be large.
Because of the country’s old-fashioned values, studies show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many transmissions of diseases are associated with insufficient sexual protection of such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to use universal access to HIV drugs to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking employee GOP senator’s data, saying it’s “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned allegations that an employee of hers had posted personal details of three Republican U.S. senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that such claims are being spread by “ultra-right” trolls and their websites.
“Lies, lies, and more despicable lies,” Waters said in a tweet.
The information disclosed allegedly included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch (both from Utah).
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown individual on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing over allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked shortly after Kavanaugh was questioned by three senators.
Prolific websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the post was linked to the Waters office and released membership information of an employee of Waters, Hill said.
“This unsubstantiated claim is a complete and absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“My employees, whose identity, personal data, and safety are at risk because of their fraudulent and false claims, are in no way responsible for this information leak.
This unsubstantiated claim is a complete and irrefutable lie."
Waters’ statement was quickly reviewed online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial stems from anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that he has an emotion that is inappropriate for a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t get angry.
They must not be defiant.
They must not question the motives of the accuser.
They need to stay calm.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is running for Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“It’s important when it comes to the truth,” he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said his office had warned “relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies about their fraudulent claims.”
“We will do everything we can to find out who the perpetrators are and to hold them legally responsible for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all of my employees.”
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again - The Under-Embedded Spy Parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is now customary to look for meanings of Brexit in all new British films, and this seems to be particularly appropriate in the parody series of Johnny English’s action comedy – which began with Johnny English in 2003 and was followed by Johnny English Reborn in 2011 – reenactment.
Is it humorous to joke about ourselves on how obviously stupid we are in a country’s new export opportunity?
In any case, the rubber-faced incompetent Johnny English has been given permission to do things once again in his clumsy way – and that this broad comic creation is for non-English-speaking film territories.
Of course, this is a secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretentious smoothie glamour, reminds me a little of Clouseau, a little of Mr Bean and a little of the character who gave the tone to Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It’s also based on the character’s journey and the international mystery Atkinson, who was once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving nothing but chaos behind.
There is only one or two pleasant moments in this latest JE film.
I liked the approach to Johnny English’s helicopter when he was wearing a medieval iron suit and the helicopter’s wings swung against his helmet for a moment.
Atkinson’s talent for making physical comedy is shown, but humor seems less important and oddly redundant, especially when “serious” spy movies like 007 and Mission Impossible also confidently offer themselves as comedy.
It seems that this humor is more for children than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s clever adventures aren’t as resourceful and focused as Atkinson’s silent films Beanina.
The assumption is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain’s top-secret spy network, exposing the identities of all British secret police officers, thus creating a huge disappointment for the on-site agent – a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last straw for the Prime Minister, a celebratory and struggling figure who suffers from the burden of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does this Teresa-May character admirably, but there’s not much to work on in the script.
His intelligence advisers recommend that, since all active spies are under threat, he must recall someone who has retired.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a schoolmaster at one of the proud institutions, giving secret lessons on how to be a secret agent: here are a couple of good places where English offers a School of Rock-type spy school.
English is flown back to Whitehall for emergency reporting and reunited with his former longtime partner, Bough, who is played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married to the submarine’s captain, where actress Vicki Pepperdine’s talents have been severely squandered.
So Batman and Robin, the disgraced members of Her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action, encountering the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurolenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls under the dangerously charismatic hand of a tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve all of Britain's computer problems: the hapless Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their sleazy odyssey: hiding as waitresses, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos by sneaking Volta’s luxury yacht aboard; and English sets off a veritable mayhem as he attempts to use a virtual reality headset to explore the interior of Volta’s house.
In this last section, no brakes are used, but as cute and hasty as it is, the whole thing has a children's TV flavor attached to it.
Pretty mediocre stuff.
And like other Johnny English films, I caught myself thinking: does the British film industry really not have a role to give Rowan Atkinson that would be fair to his talent?
Labour denies drawing up a plan in which Britons work four days a week but are paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party has considered a ground-breaking plan that would see Britons working four days a week, but being paid for five days.
The party wants the company’s bosses to pass on the savings received through the Artificial Intelligence Revolution (AI) to employees by giving them one extra day off.
That way, employees would have a three-day weekend – but they would get the same pay.
According to the source, this idea would fit into the party’s economic agenda, and so the state intends to lean in favor of the workers.
Thursday’s working week has been approved by the Trade Union Congress so that workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
A Labour source told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that the bill will be announced before the end of the year.
“This is not going to happen overnight, but the Thursday working week is an aspiration that fits in with the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a Thursday working week during its 2017 election campaign.
At present, however, the Labour Party as a whole does not support this effort.
A Labour spokesman said: “The Thursday working week is not party policy and the party will not discuss it.”
Undersecretary John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to refine his vision of a socialist turnaround in the economy.
McDonnell said he had decided to take back power from “face-to-face managers” and “profit-makers” of utility companies.
The Undersecretary’s plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not get their full share back, as the Labour Party could make “deductions” in connection with a perceived misdemeanour.
He confirmed his plan to put employees on company boards and set up participatory equity funds to give 10% of the equity of private companies to employees, instead of giving annual bonuses of up to €561.65.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk on '60 Minutes' about whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on the Supreme Court nomination for at least one week, raising questions as to whether the FBI’s findings could affect the end of support for Republican senators.
In a Sunday poll, 60 Minutes co-host Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that might make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said I was going to be interrogated. I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges came out and asked, “Did you do that?”
He was decisive, firm and unequivocal.”
Graham's voice seems to be rock solid.
“I’m confident in my decision with Brett Kavanaugh and that could only be changed on the news,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know how this happened, but I know Brett vigorously denied it,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And not everyone he mentioned could confirm it.
It's a 36-year-old thing.
I don’t see anything new coming.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, the annual New York Global Citizen Festival will host the annual music event, with a hugely impressive celebrity presence and just as impressive a goal: to eradicate poverty from the world.
Now held for the seventh time, the Global Citizen Festival sees tens of thousands of people in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only enjoying singers like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raising awareness of the true purpose of the event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of lawyers hoping to end poverty by continuously increasing the number of people fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete a number of tasks or volunteer activities, send an email to a world leader, make a phone call, or do something else important to help raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when there are still 12 years left to reach their goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert a real way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another click-bait where people feel like they’re doing something important by signing a statement online or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million “actions” of its supporters, striving to achieve a number of different goals.
These actions have helped world leaders communicate more than $37 billion in commitments and policies that will affect more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, Group 390 cited commitments and communications arising from their activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or funded.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers that is committed to “help children exploit their full potential” by promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help the country end malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn malnutrition into a historic footnote to social injustice,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told a crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also reported that after more than 5,000 actions calling for improved maternal and child nutrition in the UK, the government announced a funding project, The Power of Nutrition, which reaches the 5 million women and children in need of nutritional intervention.
In response to one of the FAQs on our website, which asks, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It’s a long and hard road – sometimes we fall and fail.
But just as we face great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we are confident of our success, because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are just a couple of performers performing at this year’s event in New York City, led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use naval ‘barrier’ to block Russia’s energy exports
According to the Washington Examiner, Washington may use its navy, if necessary, to prevent the Russian energy market from being hit, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed.
Zinke argued that Russia's involvement in Syria, especially when it is at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they’re in the Middle East is because they want to channel energy like they do in Eastern Europe, on the belly of Southern Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States has this opportunity, with the help of our navy, to ensure that maritime lines are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy does not enter the market,” he added.
Zinke’s statement was addressed to the participants of an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that represents the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
“The economic choice between Iran and Russia is more or less, leverage and fuel substitution,” he said, while referring to Russia as a “one-trick pony” whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is tasked with increasing exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to crowd out the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is motivated simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said at a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. stance has suffered a setback from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the German Confederation of Industries (BDI), called on the US to stay away from the EU’s energy policy and the Berlin-Moscow bilateral agreements.
“I have a big problem if a third country interferes in our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrialists’ Union (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she was seriously considering running for president in the midterm elections.
At Holyoke Town Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed his candidacy was under consideration.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes the First Lady,” she said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.”
Warren also gave an assessment of President Donald Trump’s actions in the city hall, saying he was “moving the country in the wrong direction.
“I’m really worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has voiced criticism of Trump and its Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a poll released Thursday showed that most of Warren’s own voters don’t think he should run for office in 2020.
According to a poll conducted by the University of Suffolk’s Boston Globe, 58% of “probable” Massachusetts voters believe that a senator should not run for office.
32% supported such a proposal.
The poll showed more support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour of a possible candidacy and 48% against.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin Quotes From Donald Trump’s Gathering on Track Palin’s PTSD
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after recruiting in September.
He was arrested on Monday night in connection with a domestic violence case and charged with
“What my son is going through, what he’s going through when he comes back, I can relate to other families who are feeling the consequences of PTSD and the wounds our soldiers are coming back with,” Trump said.
Palin called the arrest of his son an “elephant in the room” and said regarding his son and other war veterans that “they come back a little differently, they come back tempered, they come back wondering if there is enough respect for what has been given to the state by soldiers and airmen and all the other military personnel.”
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and spokeswoman Dan Bennett of the Wasilla Police Department said he was accused of domestic violence against a woman, meddling in a domestic violence report, and possession of a gun while intoxicated.
18 states and the District of Columbia challenge new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that bans asylum for victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 countries and regions made a brief statement in Washington on Friday to support the challenging asylum seeker policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff’s full name, Grace v. Sessions Suit, was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said her accomplice “and her violent gang-member sons” abused her, but U.S. officials did not accept her asylum request on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries that produce large numbers of U.S. asylum seekers, including gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Council that allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "has ignored state, union and international law for decades."
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be resolved according to the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a requirement violates this principle," the court's brief statement said.
Lawyers also argued in a brief statement that denying entry to immigrants would hurt the U.S. economy, saying they were likely to become entrepreneurs and “providing the necessary workforce.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
“An application for asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear for their race, religion, nationality, or a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day.
Entertaining rescue operations in Palu, where deaths have doubled in the fight to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly threatening.
“The situation is very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who consoled her feverish baby boy at the Palu city evacuation center.
“Every minute, new people arrive in the ambulance.
There’s not enough clean water.”
Residents returned to their destroyed homes, sorting through soaked things and trying to save everything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals damaged by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including those with broken back and upper arms, rested outside Palu Army Hospital, where patients continued to be treated outdoors due to strong aftershocks.
Tears filled her eyes as she recalled how a strong earthquake shook her fifth-floor hotel room, which she shared with her husband and daughter.
“There was no time to save myself.
I think I was pushed against a wall in the ruins,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that her family had come to the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're not in danger."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of “bullying with incitement ads”
A week after China’s official newspaper ran a four-page ad under U.S. Daily News about the reciprocal daily benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American media to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to a supplement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register — the state’s largest newspaper in Iowa — after China was accused of meddling in the U.S. Congressional elections on November 6, which China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials described to Reuters as a new stage in Washington’s expanding campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to do advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war in which each other’s import tariffs are being adjusted.
China’s retaliatory measures at the start of the tariff war were intended to hit exporters in states like Iowa because they supported Trump’s Republican parties, Chinese and US experts have explained.
The U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor, as well as China’s largest exporter of agricultural products, Terry Branstad, said Beijing harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a Des Moines Register op-ed on Sunday: “China has now doubled its bullying by publishing incitement ads in our free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using America’s precious freedom of speech and free press practice by putting its paid advertising on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, Beijing’s street kiosk has only limited votes and cannot see the truly different views the Chinese people may have on China’s worrisome economic course, given that the media is firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party,” he added.
He added that one of China’s most prominent newspapers refused to publish his article, but did not say which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn Republicans will alienate female voters before midterm elections with Kavanaugh fiasco
While many Republicans are waiting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of multiple sexual assaults, analysts have warned they will see a setback in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
Feelings surrounding the situation have been high, and most Republicans have already shown that they want to move forward with the vote.
These things cannot be undone,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said the last-minute effort by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to investigate the FBI was enough to appease angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday — they will not forget it tomorrow or in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national representative for the progressive group MoveOn.
On Friday morning, protesters repeated “November is coming!” at their rally in the Senate corridor as Republicans who oversee the committees of judges decided to move forward with Kavanaugh’s candidacy despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, Mic said.
"Democratic fervour and inner conviction are starting to get out of hand," unofficial political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news site.
“People say it’s already high, it’s true.
But that may be higher, especially among suburban female voters and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who don’t like the president and often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony describing his allegations of sexual assault on a Supreme Court nominee, analysts predicted a setback as Republicans moved forward with reassurances.
“It’s become very confusing for the GOP,” Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee vote, it’s not just about the final vote, it’s also about whether Kavanaugh is going to be appointed, it’s about how Republicans have dealt with it and how they’ve treated him,” said Guy Cecil, head of the Priorities USA (the group that helps Democrats vote).
However, Americans seem to be a little divided, who, after testimony, believe Ford and who Kavanaugh, but a little more supportive of the former.
A new YouGov poll showed that 41% of respondents believed Ford’s testimony was certain or likely, while 35% said they definitely or likely believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh had probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30% thought the same about Ford.
Thanks to Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other indictment, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Ford testified last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked him when he was 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee showed him his genitals when they attended a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet that will challenge Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launched a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds the Berners-Lee open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has been granted access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal was “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data collection” or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and competent tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all available in one browser and at the same time.
What makes this personal online dataset unique is that the user can choose who gets access to this information.
The company calls it “the giving of personal authority through data.”
According to the company’s CEO John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is for the company to bring sources, process, and relevant skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers hired to work under contract on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team aren’t talking to Facebook and Google about whether to bring about a complete change if all their business models are fully supported overnight.
“We won’t ask their permission.”
In a post published on Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s goal is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new Web, built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Memorial stone for a clergyman who received the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only English church to receive the Victoria Cross during World War I celebrated its 100th anniversary in its hometown.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann fought off his medal of honor on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Belleglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper bullet and did not know that he had received the highest British military decoration.
His two grandsons opened the memorial on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it would be “brilliantly symbolic” if the stone were opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s award-winning fight.
According to the London Gazette, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918, "through a bullet blast of very thick fog and machine guns."
Later he hastened to the line of attack and carried it forward with the "greatest gallance," before he hastened alone to one machine gun and knocked three opponents unconscious.
Lt. Col. Vanni was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I’ll never be able to repeat, but for which I’ll always be grateful.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, laid out a wreath after a parade led by Brentwood's Coningry Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to be part of this parade" and added that "the presence and support of so many people shows that a true hero is appreciated."
MMA fans were up all night to watch the Bellator 206, but only saw Peppa the Pig
Imagine you’ve been up all night watching Bellator 206, but you’re not even shown this main event.
The San Jose match included 13 fights, including six from the main map, and was shown live on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom throughout the night.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to confront each other, viewers in the UK were left gagged by the appearance of Peppa the Pig.
Many were not enthusiastic about it, especially those who had stayed awake until the early hours to see just this struggle.
One fan described the transition to a children's comic book on Twitter as "no hurtful joke".
"It's government regulation that at 6:00 a.m. the content was no longer appropriate and they had to switch to the children's program," Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, said in a statement.
"Pig Peppa, yes."
Bellator President Scott Coker said they plan to work on their own schedule to take more account of UK viewers in the future.
"When I think about playback now, I think we can solve this problem in the future," Coker said.
“But if it’s 6 a.m. on a Sunday morning, we can’t do it until our own Sunday, which is their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, there was a lot of back and forth text, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical malfunction.
But it wasn’t, it was the government’s policy.
I can promise you that won't happen next time.
We’re going to show six fights instead of five — as we usually do — we tried to offer more to the fans, and we just went over time.
This is a tough situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality — but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he was in high school that “everyone is not like him.”
While attending Lauren Laverne's Radio 4 show Desert Island Discs, he said he would talk about gay rights to give others hope.
Becoming a parent also changed his attitude toward winning the Olympics, giving him the feeling that it was no longer that important.
Kirsty Young, the usual long-time host of the show, had to take a few months off due to her illness.
In Laverne's first show, Daley said she felt less valuable than the others growing up because it wasn't socially acceptable for you to like boys and girls.
To this day, those feelings of not being worthy and feeling different have given me the power and strength to succeed.
She wanted to prove she was worth “something” and not disappoint others when they finally found out about her sexuality.
The two-time bronze medallist has become a highly respected leader of the LGBT campaign, using her appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he was talking about it because he was lucky that he could live openly without consequences and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man — U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — “struck him with surprise.”
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years her senior last year, but she said the age difference has never been a problem.
“When you go through so much when you’re young” — she went to her first Olympics at the age of 14, and her father died of cancer three years later — it was hard to find someone the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his “whole outlook” has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal,” he said.
“But you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said her father didn’t agree to die, and one of the last things she asked was if they had tickets to London in 2012 — because she wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you can’t sit in the front row, because you’ll be gone by then,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he had actually stopped breathing and died did I finally admit that he wasn’t invincible,” she said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I just knew that this was what I’d been dreaming of all my life – diving in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there’s no better feeling than that,” he said.
It also inspired his first selection of songs - Heather Small's Proud - which helped him prepare for the Olympics and still gives him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson was removed from the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson sets a record Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he must improve his form to avoid an unlucky milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for the 12th time in the biennial event, was removed from the game by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday’s doubles and four-ball.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has often been for the U.S., the five-time winner split his day in two, being a cheerleader and working on his game, hoping to improve it.
Never the most direct hitter, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old isn’t particularly suited to play on the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where a long, rough course punishes consistently missed shots.
And if the pitch itself isn’t scary enough, Mickelson will face exact British Open champion Francesco Molinar on Sunday, his ninth race, who has teamed up with novice Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his races this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind at the start of 12 singles games, start hot, the Mickelson race can be extremely important.
Furyk expressed confidence in her husband, but she didn’t have much else to add.
“He fully understood his part of today, patted me on the shoulder, put his arm around my shoulder and said he was ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He is very self-confident.
He is a celebrity and he has given so much to our teams both in the past and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play two games.
I saw more coming, but it happened, and we had to choose this path.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson beats Nick Faldo's record as the most Ryder Cup player on Sunday.
It may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which has never matched his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his presence has made an additional mental contribution to the team.
“He’s funny, mocking, funny, he likes to have fun with people, and he’s just great in the team room,” she explained.
“I think the younger players had a lot of fun going up against him this week and it was great to see.
It’s more than just a game.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn Knows Big Lead Could Soon Disappear
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that Ryder Cup’s big lead at the start of a single game in the last day can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
The Dane made his public debut at the 1997 Valderrama, where he and Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but it had dropped drastically as he crossed the finish line, with a win of only 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 to 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You even remember that we had a great lead in Valderrama; we also had great success in Brookline where we lost and in Valderrama where we won, that victory came very close," said Bjorn in the picture after winning Class of 2018 5:3 on Friday and 10:6 at Le Golf National yesterday.
So history shows me and the whole team that this could happen again.
You're going to do your best tomorrow.
You go out and do the right thing.
It's not over until you have points.
We have a goal, which is to win the cup, and so we will focus on that.
I’ve always said I’ll focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we’re very aware of who our opponents are – the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with the way his players have played on this difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I’m not going to get ahead of things.
Tomorrow there will be a whole new set of obstacles.
Tomorrow will be a personal event, and that’s a different story.
It’s nice to be with your opponent when things are going well, but if you’re there in person, you’ll be fully tested as a golfer.
This is the message you need to deliver to the players - do your best tomorrow.
If you leave your partner now, he or she will have to go and get along on his or her own.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk hopes his players will perform better in person than they do with their opponents, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced both during these last few days, being part of the team of Brookline's victory before becoming part of the defeat when Europe defeated the "Miracle of Medinah".
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to a question about how in 1999 Captain Ben Crenshaw inspired his players to put everything into their last day of play.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you have to start with a fire, like Brookline and Medinah.
If the momentum goes in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the average races.
We will set up our team accordingly and put the boys on the pitch in a way where we feel like a miracle can happen tomorrow.”
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the race and he is up against Rory McIlroy, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other best Europeans in the race.
“I put my boys in that order because I think that’s how we’re properly covered,” Bjorn said of his selection of singles.
Germany's new warship has been delayed
The German navy's newest high-speed yacht was supposed to come into service in 2014, replacing outdated Cold War war warships, but that won't happen until next year due to faulty systems and increased costs as a snowball, local media reported.
The deployment of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class high-speed sailing flagship Rheinland-Pfalz has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to a military press release published in the Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship should have joined the Navy as early as 2014, but the worrying post-delivery problems did not make the fate of this ambitious project easy.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the navy in 2007 will replace the outdated Bremen-class high-speed yachts.
It is understandable that they have a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some cloaking technologies, such as reducing radar, infrared and audible signals.
Other important options include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to send the latest speedboats out of the home port for up to two years.
Constant delays mean, however, that top-class warships - which allow Germany to consolidate power abroad - will become obsolete by the time they enter service.
The unsuccessful F125 speedboat made the news last year when the German navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has sent a ship back to a shipbuilder since it was received.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of important "software and hardware deficiencies" that rendered the warship unusable if used in combat missions.
The software shortages were particularly important, as the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships were managed by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the workforce of the older Bremen-class high-speed yachts.
It also turned out that the ship is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the navy to incorporate future innovations.
Weighing 7,000 tons, the Rhineland-Palatinate is thought to be twice as heavy as the same class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including team training, also becomes a problem.
It is said to amount to EUR 3.1 billion (USD 3.6 billion) – compared to the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the newer high-speed sailboats are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German navy is losing power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy had actually "run out of ships that could be taken out of service".
The official said the issue had grown into a snowball over time as old ships were scrapped, but no replacement ships arrived.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class speedboats were allowed to join the navy.
The National Trust investigates the secret life of bats
A new study in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to search for their food.
The results are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
A study by researchers at the Scottish National Trust tracks common and soprano pipels in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross, as well as brown long-eared and Daubenton bats.
Special recorders are placed in the main places of the area to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers also carry out field research using hand-held sensors.
The competent assessment of all recordings determines the frequency of bat cries and the activity of the species.
A habitat map and report are then created to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
NTS conservation adviser Rob Dewar hopes the results will show which habitats are most important for bats and how different species use them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to conserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom, bat populations have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities, which affect their habitats and their loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as can flying papers and the chemical treatment of some building materials, as well as attacks from pet cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting, their ears are more useful for catching prey than their eyes.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
Across the country, NTS, responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who carry out regular surveys, inspections, and sometimes rescues.
The organisation has even created Scotland's first and only special bat reserve in the Threave area of Dumfrie and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says this area is the perfect territory for them.
“In Threave, we have a large area for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a great place to live.
But there’s still a lot to discover about bats, so the work we’re doing here and in other areas helps us better understand what they need.”
She stresses the importance of controlling bats before starting maintenance activities on the property, as the unwanted destruction of one place of pregnancy and childbirth can kill up to 400 mothers and young, and even destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb or destroy them.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer in the Bats Defence League, has encouraged the public to contribute.
“We still have so much to learn about our bats, and we just don’t know how many of our species and how their populations feed.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Allegations While Lawyers Plan to Sue German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed allegations of rape against him as "fake news", saying people "want to advertise themselves" using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The attacker was accused of raping Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He has reportedly paid the woman €330,643.10 to keep her from talking about the incident, Der Spiegel said Friday.
Turning to a live video on Instagram of its 142 million followers half an hour after the allegations, Ronaldo (33) said it was “fake news”.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What we're talking about today is fake news," a five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the news.
They want to advertise on my behalf.
It's normal.
They want to be famous with my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and all is well,” the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over “the disclosure of an unauthorized suspicion regarding privacy,” according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said the player is seeking compensation for “moral damage commensurate with the seriousness of the violation, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went back to the player’s hotel room, where he allegedly was raped, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told him he was “a 99 percent good man” of whom “one percent fail.”
Documents claim Ronaldo confirmed the couple’s sexual relationship, but this was not unanimous.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and took photos of the injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because he feared “revenge” and was worried about “public humiliation.”
Now a 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to refute the solution, as the alleged incident continues to traumatize her.
Ronaldo had left Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack and joined Real Madrid, and this summer he moved to Italy in connection with a 100 million euro deal with giant Juve.
Brexit: UK may regret leaving automakers forever
The UK would "regret it forever" if it lost its position as the world's auto industry leader after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border-crossing halts without a Brexit deal could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis vehicles, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see a halt in the production process at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Burnaston Toyota.
Other UK automakers have also feared leaving the EU without a deal, raising concerns about the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close the Mini plant in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to supply chain risks in the absence of a Brexit agreement.
Toyota’s production line operates on demand, with spare parts arriving from both the UK and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the border, which industry says could lead to delays and shortages.
Toyota would not be able to keep more than one day’s supply at its Derbyshire plant, so production must be halted.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan for the EU’s future relationship is “exactly calibrated to avoid such checks at the border.”
"We want the best solution that allows us to do what we want, and not just take advantage of the current success, but the opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers shows that we need to be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain set-up.”
Toyota could not say for how long production would be halted, but in the long run, it warned that additional costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a union representative for Unite who has been in Burnaston for 24 years, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “We know from our own experience that if jobs are lost, they will not come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s high-stakes meeting with Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be delayed by another week as the fight against top contender Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein will follow the work of Commissioner Robert Mueller, who will investigate Russian election interference, links between Trump’s aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and thereby threaten Mueller’s independence has been fueling Washington’s rumors for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed with Trump the use of wiretaps to record conversations and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein did not confirm this.
But last Monday, he went to the White House announcing his intention to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was then at the UN in New York.
Trump said he didn’t want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a chance encounter with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of sexual assault, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both gave lessons.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, postponing a Senate vote.
Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about his meeting with Rosenstein, he said: “That date has not yet been set, it may be this week, but it may be delayed by another week, taking into account all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But let's look at it and keep the press up to date, as always."
Some journalists would dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since Sept. 10.
Chris Wallace asked me why.
Sanders said the shortage of briefings was not a result of deliberately disappointing TV journalists, although he added: "I don't object to the fact that they've been made to disappoint."
He then suggested direct contact between Trump and the press.
The president does more Q&A sessions than any president before him,” he said, adding no evidence: “We’ve looked at those numbers.”
“If the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly from the President of the United States, that’s much better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do that a lot, and you’ve seen how we’ve done it over the last few weeks, so it’s going to happen during a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with guests.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated, perhaps, why, having been in a free-wheeling and sometimes odd-looking state before gathering in front of reporters.
Health minister writes to EU workers NHS in Scotland about Brexit fears
The Minister of Health has written to EU workers working in the Scottish NHS to express the country’s gratitude and wish them to remain in the post-Brexit situation.
Jeane Freeman sent her letter less than six months before the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the costs of the established status for EU citizens working in its public services.
In a letter, Freeman wrote: “In the summer, negotiations on the UK-EU withdrawal have continued, moving towards the expected decisions for this autumn.
However, the UK Government has also made preparations for a possible non-agreement scenario.
I know this is a very upsetting time for you.
That’s why I wanted to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare work and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
“Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head trauma
Tennessee State Tigers support player Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury and defeat on Saturday 31:27 from Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ revealed.
Tennessee State manager Rod Reed told reporters the injury happened just before halftime.
“He fell on his side and just collapsed,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on her side before she was placed on a stretcher and taken off the field for further inspection.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris (WSMV – Nashville, Tennessee) that Abercrombie’s surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center had ended.
Harris added that there are no details about the type or extent of the injury, and that Tennessee State is still trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
The second-year student in the red shirt, Abercrombie, was in Tennessee for her first season after crossing over from Illinois.
He had five fights before leaving the game on Saturday, which made a total of 18 matches this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, using this extra money to help the homeless under the new Tory plans
This step will defuse Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters
Stamp duty is levied on those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
Finance ministry hopes to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty rate if they buy property in the UK, using that extra money to help the homeless, Theresa May said today.
The movement is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide them with affordable housing and target high-income people.
The stamp duty will tax individuals and businesses that do not pay tax in the UK, channeling the extra money into the government’s desire to fight homelessness.
The premium – which is in addition to this stamp duty, including the higher levels imposed two years ago on second home and sublease purchases – can be as high as three percent.
The Treasury expects this movement to generate up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of the properties purchased in London belong to non-UK residents, which raises prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to gain a foothold when buying a home.
Many affluent areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost cities” thanks to a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping real estate prices high when they buy land but don’t use it, and urged May to give up quotas for affordable homes to remedy Britain’s “housing shame.”
Corbyn has announced eye-catching housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to harassment of innocent people.
He also wants to give more power to councils to build new homes.
Last year, as Prime Minister, I pledged to restore the British dream – that life would be better for each new generation.
And that means improving our broken housing market.
The UK is always open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is right that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies abroad, have it as easy to buy homes as hard-working British people.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and harsh sleeping conditions are a common reality.”
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland”
Sunderlans leader Jack Ross says his “ultimate goal” is to become Scotland’s leader at some point.
The Scotsman (42) is delighted with the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which is currently in third place in League One, with just 3 points behind.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Champions League last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got to class B and that was it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportssound.
“But I grew up watching Hampden in Scotland with my dad, and that’s always something that’s pulled me back.
This opportunity will only come if I am successful in managing the club.”
His predecessors as Sunderland chairman have been Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
A former Alloa Athletic manager says he had no fear of such big and well-known names, having previously held out in both Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success at the moment is if I can take this club to the Champions League.”
Because of its structure and facilities, this club is definitely part of the Champions League," he said.
It’s not an easy task to get there, but I only see myself as successful if I can get the club back there.”
Ross has worked as a manager for just three years, previously serving as Deputy Director of Dumbarton and 15 months among Hearts’ senior staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from the fall to the third level and made St Mirren's lowest position the winner of the next championship.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he did during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
“It was a real crossroads,” he recalled taking over Alloa.
“I really believed that driving was better for me than playing.
It seems odd because I made it, earned a reasonable income, and enjoyed some of the highlights.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things to do on a weekly basis.
I still experience it in light of the tension and pressure of my work, but the management just feels more right.
I've always wanted to drive, and now I do, and I'm more comfortable now than I've ever been in adulthood."

According to the study, the best time for the pint is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat has improved pub turnover in Britain’s struggling pubs, but more pressure has been put on restaurant chains.
The figures showed that the turnover of pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, while that of restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a representative of the business consulting firm CGA, who compiled these figures, said: “Continued sunshine and England’s longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July was similar to June, when pub turnover increased by 2.8%, except that restaurants went even harder.
The restaurant trade, which declined by 1.8% in June, deteriorated further in July.
Drinks-based pubs and bars were the most successful and restaurants trying to please were the worst.
Food-based pubs also suffered despite the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurateurs.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between managed pubs and bars, beverage sales increased 6.6 percent over the month, while food sales dropped three percent.
Leisure and hospitality analyst Paul Newman said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since late April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factor when it comes to sales outside the home market.
Unsurprisingly, restaurant chains continue to struggle, even though the 4.8 percent drop in sales from last year is particularly painful in addition to the ongoing price pressure.
The long and hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse time for food businesses, and only time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we’ve experienced in August provide some much-needed relief.”
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand-related institutions.
Coffer Peach Tracker’s industry sales monitor for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 action groups with a total turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is a well-established industry benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents
One in five children, including 11-year-olds, have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 high school students found a growth of “fake Instagram” pages
The news escalated the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students said they have a “basic account” to show parents
The study found that one in five children, some as young as 11, create secret social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school seniors found a noticeable increase in “fake Instagram” accounts (a reference to a picture-sharing page on Instagram).
The news escalated fears that sexual content was being posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they had both a “main account” meant to show parents and a “main account” they made acceptable to themselves.
One of the discoverers of a secret newspaper for his 13-year-old daughter saw a teenager asking others to rape him.
The Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles and half admitted to having personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s disturbing to see so many teenagers being lured into creating accounts on the Internet where parents and teachers can’t find them.”

Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director at the Scottish Athletics annual board meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most acclaimed athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from his extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh is respected throughout Scotland, the UK and other sports communities, and we are confident that Scottish athletes will take advantage of his call to management,” Beattie said in a statement.
Doyle said: “I want to be a spokesperson for the athletes and I hope to be able to make a real contribution to Scotland’s sport and contribute to its development.”
An American who won a total of four Olympic gold medals in the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and now frequently shares his opinion on the BBC, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I recover and if so, to what extent.
I’ve worked hard, but I’ve fully recovered, learned to walk again, and I’m already doing speed training!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!”
Breast-pump ad that compares women to cows splits the internet in two
The breast pump company has divided the internet into two camps with an ad that compares a nursing mother to a milking cow.
To celebrate the launch of what is rumored to be the “world’s first silent wearable breast pump,” consumer-focused technology company Elvie released a similar ad for an ironic music video to showcase the freedom this new pump gives out to moms who want to live.
Four real mothers dance in a hayloft with cows and sing, “Yes, I milk myself, but you can’t see my tail” and “If you didn’t notice, they’re not udders, they’re my breasts.”
Repeatedly the verse: "Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, I fill my ladies with milk."
However, advertising on the company’s Facebook page has sparked controversy on the Internet.
Viewers of the video with 77 000 views and thousands of comments disagree. Many of them say that it illuminates the back of the dairy tent.
“Using cows to advertise this product was a very poor decision.
Like us, they have to become pregnant and give birth to milk, but the difference is that their babies are stolen within a few days of being born.”

Another commenter said: “Obviously traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use them to promote breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?”
Someone added: “A totally inconceivable advertisement.”
Some of them are pro-advertising, and one woman thought the story was hilarious.
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would buy one of these if I were still breastfeeding.
Pumping milk made me feel like a cow.
Advertising's a little crazy, but let's just take it as it is.
It’s a brilliant product,” wrote one.
Another commented, “It’s a fun ad (often in their workplaces or toilets) for mothers who pump and feel like cows.
This ad neither praises nor condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they have all been dancing in bras with non-obtrusive pumps.
The idea of the campaign is based on the saying that many women who pump milk from the breast feel like cows.
But the Elvie Pump is completely quiet, has no wires or pipes, and is not conspicuous by its nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move around, hold babies, and even go outside while pumping.
Mother’s partner and ECD Ana Balarin commented: “Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserves a bold and irritating introduction.
With women’s expression and the comparison of dairy cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all its challenges, while at the same time presenting in an entertaining and familiar way the extraordinary sense of freedom that the new pump creates.
This isn't the first time the news has covered Elvie's pump.
At London Fashion Week, the mother of two children wearing designer Marta Jakubowski’s product appeared on the stage.
Thousands of Migrant Children Quietly Go to Campground at Texas Border
The number of children of detained migrants has risen sharply, although monthly border crossings have remained quite the same. Partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies enforced by the Trump administrator have made it difficult to establish children with the help of sponsors.
Usually, most sponsors are immigrants with documents and they have been afraid to violate the possibility of staying in their country, for which they demand the custody of the child.
The threat increased in June when national authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults in the household could provide fingerprints and data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs administration official, told Congress last week that the agency had arrested dozens of people seeking financial support for non-accompanying minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal history.
“Nearly 80 percent of sponsors or members of a sponsor’s household are in the country illegally, and a large number of them have a criminal background.
So we will continue to pursue them," said Mr Albence.
To deal with the children more quickly, officials enforced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month after arrest. Previously, according to asylum workers, it was 60 days later.
Many defend their legal content before an immigration judge by videoconferencing instead of showing up.
Those ineligible for release are quickly expelled from the country.
According to asylum workers, and based on reports from the system published in recent months - the longer a child is in custody, the more likely they are to become nervous or depressed, which can lead to violent demonstrations or attempts to escape.
Lawyers say these concerns are more relevant in large detention facilities such as Tornillo, where a child’s size can be overlooked when facing difficulties.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to get used to the feeling or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria calls for immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish occupying forces
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called on Syrian refugees to come home to the UN General Assembly, despite the country’s eight-year war.
Moualemi, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of counter-terrorism and would be dealt with accordingly.
“They must leave immediately and unconditionally,” he said.
Moualem claimed that Syria's "war on terror is almost over" and that since 2011 more than 360,000 people have died and millions more have left their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to “fight this holy war until we have cleared the entire territory of Syria” of both terrorist groups and “any foreign forces that are illegally present.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
Speaking about the war refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were appropriate and accused some Western countries of spreading unreasonable fears that would prevent the arrival of refugees.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to help us meet them,” he said.
“They’re politicizing something that’s just a humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be given to Syria until there is an agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which creates a buffer zone for the last rebel stronghold in Idlib, has created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a widespread raid by Russian-backed Syrian forces in a province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "explicit deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would hit the jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters linked to Al-Qaeda, who would be "destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convince a new committee of government and opposition members to plan a post-war Syrian constitution and pave the way for an election at the first meetings soon.
Moualem made demands for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, saying the panel's work could be limited to reviewing articles of the current constitution and warning against interference.
Why is Trump being elected for a second term?
According to this logic, Trump could win the next election in 2020, if the impeachment and scandal have not ended his presidency before, as liberal viewers are likely to want.
Which would undoubtedly be "the most exciting end of the presidency!"
At the moment, viewers do not show any signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak hour ratings have doubled to over 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at peak hours. Compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, their number has risen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" with 3.5 million viewers via cable has kept its rating high during the main evening news.
“It’s the tension we’re under because we don’t understand it,” the head of the ABC drama Designated Survivor said of the government secretary who will become president if the attack destroys the parliament building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The leader told him he would vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” he asked.
"He said he would make me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell to me.
All this chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, Washington’s rumors could be fatal to Roe v. Wade’s future and to immigrant families who want to reunite and the global economy.
Avoiding the topic is only a luxury for privileged viewers.
But a six-hour expert talk show about Bob Woodward's "comprehensive background research" for his book "Fear" and Paul Manafort's 13,225.73€ ostrich-skin Bomber jacket (Washington Post called it a "overconfidence-breathing garment") and Stormy Daniels' ulterior motive.
I will never watch Super Mario again.
“One of his actions, which may seem like a reality show, is that he shares something every night,” said Wheelhouse Entertainment CEO and show’s creator Brent Montgomery Trump’s show’s alternating cast and day-to-day agenda (a nagging NFL, praising Kim Jong Un).
You can't miss a beat or you'll be behind the times.
When Fleiss met this week, his home on the north shore of Kauai was 80 degrees, but he had snuck into a room to watch MSNBC while recording on CNN.
He couldn’t help but watch Brett Kavanaugh deal with the Senate Judiciary Committee and the fate of the Supreme Court hang in the balance.
“I remember back in the day we did all kinds of crazy shows and people said this was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Cash flows are moving elsewhere to the coolest White House mid-term elections
No wonder Pennsylvania’s 17th District receives a cash flow thanks to the reorganization of the Congressional District, getting two incumbents on the same spot.
As a result, Conor Lamb of the Democratic Republic of the United States, who won a seat in District 2 in last spring's special election, was re-elected.
The opposing candidate is Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the previous District 12 of Pennsylvania, which in the larger section overlaps with the new 17.
The maps were changed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling in January, so the old districts were divided into unconstitutional electoral districts, favoring Republicans.
The new 17th election has unleashed a campaign in which the finance departments of the major parties – the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign National Committee (NRCC) – trump themselves with money.
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the much-vaunted March 18th Pennsylvania Congressional District emergency election.
This place has been run by a Republican for several decades, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political opinion-formers have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
US punishes El Salvador for supporting China, then withdraws
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which was a minor setback for Washington.
Mr. Trump met Panama’s President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 in a friendly atmosphere and owned a Panama hotel until partners kicked out Trump’s corporate administration team.
State Department officials decided to recall American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after ministry spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month that those countries had recently stopped supporting Taiwan.
However, only El Salvador, which received $140 million in aid from the US in 2017, was to be punished, including for drug monitoring, development and economic boost.
The proposed sanctions, which included a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rate.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level meeting aimed at security and economic prosperity, in order to arrange a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a development in efforts to prevent migrants from heading for the United States.
But in mid-September, high-ranking officials explained that they wanted to continue the consultation and stop discussing any El Salvador penalties.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence is now being criticized for speaking at a meeting in mid-October to discuss the government’s positions.
And three American ambassadors secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss domestic discussions on the request to remain anonymous.
Their discussions were confirmed by an analyst close to the government, who also spoke at the request to remain anonymous.
Educational History
The next thing that could happen is that Special Counsel Robert Mueller will publish a report on a possible Trump administration of justice, about which there is a lot of evidence in the state archives.
Mueller is also reportedly investigating whether the Trump campaign is linked to a Russian attack on our elections.
If Congress were to change sides, Trump would have to report to that body as if he were going to talk to voters again, and perhaps even his peers as judges.
There is much to be said here, and I do not want to point out that the impeachment of Trump or his European counterparts is inevitable.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make a choice that affects the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready for a coup against Hitler if only the West had prevented him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of carnage.
History goes around such turning points, and the merciless march of democracy comes closer or is delayed.
The Americans are now facing a number of turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the boiling water since it was reported that he proposed a secret recording of the president last year and speculated about his unsuitability for the post.
Rosenstein says The Times statement is inaccurate.
“How do you respond if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete and fair – or if he is upheld in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonesty?
And above all, will we vote for Congress in the midterms if Trump is held accountable?
If these tests fail, democracy will go on a long winter vacation.
But I don't think we're going to fail because we've learned from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once took over and used our ambassadorial home.
He survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later he sent me the light of the Sabbath candles on a table with a swastika on it.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Rangers' Graham Dorrans is optimistic ahead of the Battle of Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over Australia, following an impressive draw earlier this month against Villarreal in Spain, will put them in a strong position to qualify for the Europa League G-Group.
The knee injury did not allow center Graham Dorrans to make the first appearance of the season before a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for better results.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a strong opponent,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went into the game believing we could achieve something and we left the game with a point.
We might have been able to achieve more, but in general it was a fair result.
They were better in the first half and we were better in the second half.
Thursday will be another great and important European night.
Hopefully we get three points, but it’s going to be a tough game because they got a good result in their last game, but with the support of the people, I’m sure we can pull ourselves together and get a good result.
Last year was tough, thanks to that, I was injured and there were changes inside the club, but now we all have a good feeling.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put the previous season behind us and be successful.”
Women can’t sleep because of fear of pension insurance
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed it with their family members.
About half of the Nationwide study participants said they talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked about it with their children.
“People want their family to take care of them, but they don’t talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
But that should be a start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can not prepare your family for care if they do not know your wishes in advance.
Collaborate with your counselor and family by discussing where and how to get care, as these choices can be extremely important in terms of cost.
Consult your financial advisor: Your advisor may have a good plan on how to pay for these expenses.
Your funding options for long-term care can include, for example, a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help cover those costs, or proprietary self-insurance – as long as you have the money you need.
Prepare your legal documents: Stop all possible legal battles right from the start.
Get yourself a healthcare credentials to determine a trustee who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals follow your wishes during times when you are unable to communicate on your own.
Also, consider a fiduciary regarding your finances.
Choose a reliable person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid even if you are incapacitated.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your old mother has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions related to medicines and allergies?
Write these things down so that you are ready when needed.
“It’s not just about the financial side, it’s also about who the doctors are,” Martin explained.
“What medications are needed?
Who will take care of the dog?
Set it all right.”

Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, adding that the number of deaths continues to rise.
Since communications have been cut off, rescuers have received no information from the regency of Donggala, north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, located on the narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, and its population was estimated at 379,800 in 2017.
The city was about to celebrate its 40th anniversary when it was unexpectedly hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
The Donggala regency is an area that stretches for more than 300 km (180 miles) in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the province of Regents, which is the administrative region under the province, was estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of the central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, mainly concentrated on the opposite coast of Morowal, Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, tsunamis have hit Palu and Donggala several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses.
In 1996, the western part of Donggala was hit by a tsunami, killing nine.
Indonesia is seismically located in the Pacific Circle of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake off the west coast of Aceh Province, Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: In March and early April, several strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake struck the south of Indonesia's most populated island of Java, triggering a tsunami that struck the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An area near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province, is hit by a 7.6-degree earthquake.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the Sumatran islands – Mentawai Island, triggering a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A deep earthquake struck the regent of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, wreaking havoc and panic, reminding people of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami disaster.
The tsunami did not occur, but more than 100 people died in the collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist islands of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested in connection with the attack.
According to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, Palin (29) was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, in connection with allegations of domestic violence, interfering with reports of domestic violence, and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when a woman tried to report the alleged crimes to the police, Palin took her phone.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su pre-trial detention facility and is being held on unsecured bail of $500, KTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared that he was “in no way guilty,” the news network reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, meaning he could face up to a year in jail and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B offense, punishable by a one-day jail sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with a criminal offence.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
In connection with the alleged attack, police summoned his mother Sarah Palin.
The case is currently being heard by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, involvement in a domestic violence crime report, and possession of a gun, all while intoxicated.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
Veterans groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 when she linked her son’s violent behavior to PTSD resulting from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia followed by tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died since the earthquake hit Indonesia’s Sulawesi Island on Friday.
A 7.5-degree earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not functioning and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake hit the outskirts of downtown Sulawesi, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are videos on social media showing the moment of the earthquake.
When the tsunami hit, hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu.
In NYC, federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for terrorist attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York seek the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected in the New York terror attack that killed eight people. This rare sentence has not been carried out for federal crime committed since 1953.
Saipov (30) reportedly used a rental car at Home Depot to attack a bicycle lane along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, mowing both pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
According to the Death Penalty Notice issued in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors must prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and caused serious bodily harm in order to justify the death penalty.
In both cases, according to court documents, it is a possible death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was indicted by a federal jury on a 22-point charge that included eight murder charges, along with extortion commonly used by federal prosecutors for organized criminal offenses, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "intense planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing Saipov's actions as "horrifying, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullavic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the letter said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the last death trial in the Southern District Court of New York.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution was carried out in 1953 in New York City in the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, when the couple were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native Uzbek, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
Police said he told investigators he was happy with what he had done.
According to the charges, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by videos of ISIS viewed from his phone.
Police said he also wanted the ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital room.
He has not been charged with 22-point charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's national counsels, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the decision.
"We believe that the death penalty decision extends the trauma of all concerned, rather than a life sentence with no possibility of release," Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Nigel Farage is expected to lead the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the people’s army” during the protest at today’s Tory conference.
A former UKIP leader said politicians had to feel the heat of Eurosceptics because a member of Theresa May's own parliament recommended that she lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Commons commoner Peter Bone said at a march in Birmingham that the UK would "be out by now" if Mr Farage were Brexit Secretary.
But Mrs May is facing the problem of reconciling her deeply divided lines, which were stressed by Remain Conservatives, joining the city in their anti-Brexit protest.
The prime minister is struggling to keep his Chequers plan on track amid Brexit supporters, leftovers and EU attacks.
The Allies demanded that he continue the deal with Brussels in spite of a counter-offensive and force the Eurosceptics and liberals to choose between their package and “chaos”.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to “reject the Chequers plan.”
He suggested taking Farage as a partner and giving him responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
“We’d be out of here by now,” he said.
A member of parliament for Wellingborough added: “I stand up for Brexit, but we have to abandon the Chequers plan.”
Reflecting on his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws.”
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The opinion that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is not true.”
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march and told reporters: “I’ll just say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chequers plan is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and with our activists, who are actually taking to the streets and voting for us.
Please leave the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message to May, he added: “Prime Ministers can keep their jobs if they keep their promises.”
Farage said politicians at the rally must be made to “feel the heat” if they are to betray a decision taken in a 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them ‘we will not let that happen’.”
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of Brexit betrayal, uncomfortable.
“We will mobilize the people’s army of the country that gave us the victory over Brexit, and we will not rest until we have achieved an independent, self-governing, proud Britain.”
At the same time, the Icemen marched through Birmingham before a two-hour gathering in the center of the city.
A handful of activists waved “Tories Against Brexit” slogans after forming the group this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Liberals mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they faced at the opening of their party's application to the conference.
"These are the people who say that IT systems can be set up and all the technology can be taken to Canada and more, for smooth border crossing, for cross-border unrestricted trade to Ireland," he added.
“This is a complete farce.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future on Saturday at the West Massachusetts City Hall.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run in the next election in November against GOP National Representative Geoff Diehl, who was Trump’s vice president for the 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It is expected that he will face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters at the Town Hall since Trump took office.
He asked if he was going to run for president.
Warren responded, “It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, that is, the First Lady.”
The shooting of LSU Sims took place
LA Police in Baton Rouge said Saturday that a suspect in Friday's shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims has been arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. at an ET news conference.
They released a video of Friday’s shooting, asking for help in identifying the man they saw.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died in the aftermath,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being on the scene, owning a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
The 2-meter-old Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games last season, 10 of them in the starting line-up, averaging 17.4 minutes, throwing 5.6 points and taking 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches World Championship title after team scoring gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From that moment it became clear that Valtteri Bottas qualified on Saturday ahead of Lewis Hamilton, that the ranking of the Mercedes team plays a big role in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start and almost neglected Hamilton when he defended his position on the first two occasions and called on Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel went to the pit stops first and left Hamilton's group behind in heavy traffic, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the pit stop round later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after the side-by-side position when the Ferrari driver reluctantly left free to pass the inside after a third corner attempt to defend it with a double motion.
Max Verstappen started the competition from the back row of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first round for his 21-year birthday.
He then led the race most of the time, driving towards the finish line as the tyres whistled and passing Kimi Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen, taking fourth place.
He finally reached the pit stop on lap 44, but failed to increase his speed with the last eight laps, which gave Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen a fourth place.
Today is a difficult day, because Valtteri did a good job all week and was a real gentleman passing me by.
"The team has done a great job of having one of two," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday for not leaking a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not address Ford’s testimony directly before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented on what was going on in the Senate, which showed that people are “cruel, disgusting and deceitful.”
“The only beautiful thing that can happen and is happening right now that has happened in the Senate in the last few days is that you see angry and angry, mean, nasty and lying people,” he said.
“When you look at press releases and leaks that say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
I didn't do it."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Do you remember his answer to the question “Did you leak the document?” – “Ah, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't leak it."
Hold on a second.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak," he added with the senator's look.
Ford sent a letter to Feinstein in July about the charges against Kavanaugh, and it was leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his workplace.
The Hill said: “I did not hide Dr. Ford’s accusations or leak his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“He asked me to keep it confidential, and I did so at his request.”
But his denial did not suit the president, who commented during Saturday’s rally: “You know what, it was a very poor body language.
Maybe he didn’t, but it’s one of the worst body languages I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president hinted that Democrats are using these accusations for their own ends.
“They have decided to take back power without choosing the means.
You see it in malice and disgust; they don't care who they hurt, who they need to run over in order to have power and control."
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5 :3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scores two goals against Dundee
The Dundee Stars defeated the Belfast Giants 5-3 at Friday’s rematch of the Premier League.
The Giants led the game with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to a draw before Dwyer led the Giants again.
Francois Bouchard equalized Dundee's position before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's gates secured their victory.
This was the third loss for Adam Keefe's men in the elite league. They came to Belfast on Friday night to beat Dundee as 2 : 1.
It was the fourth game of the season, with the Giants winning three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came at 3:35 a.m. with the help of Kendall McFaul and David Rutherford when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
Sullivan brought the home team back into the game in a quick first third at 13:10, before Matt Marquardti helped Cownie score a goal in 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants would lead before the first break, scoring their second goal of the night at the end of the first third.
On the home court, the players regrouped and Bouchard leveled them again, scoring a goal of 27:37 per minute in numerical superiority.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee a lead at the end of the second third of the game for the first time, securing victory over his team in the offensive zone in the final third.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, will meet Milton Keynes at home in the next game.
Air Traffic Controller Dies to Save Hundreds of People from Earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller was declared a hero after he gave his life to ensure the safe take-off of a plane carrying hundreds of people.
The massive earthquake that struck Sulawesi Island on Friday caused a tsunami that left more than 800 people dead, many of whom remain unaccounted for.
The area is hit by strong aftershocks and many people are trapped in the ruins of Palu city.
Despite the fact that colleagues of 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung escaped from the turbulent air tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport, Palu refused to leave.
He stayed on duty to ensure the safe take-off of Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time.
Then he jumped out of the tower, thinking it was going to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter to transport him from Kalimantan Balikpapan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died in the morning, even before the helicopter arrived in Palus.
“We were extremely saddened to hear about this,” the spokesman added.
At the same time, authorities fear that the number of deaths could rise to thousands. According to the country's disaster relief agency, access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was restricted.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said: “The number of deaths could increase because the bodies of many victims are still in ruins and have not been accessed.”
Six-meter waves devastated the town of Palu, where a mass burial takes place on Sunday.
The military and passenger aircraft provide assistance and equipment.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Ambulances are making new victims every minute.
Clean water is rare.
Small markets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don’t know what they might find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready for this?” said CNN.
The Indonesian city of Lombok was hit by an earthquake earlier this year that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini airline claims one man missing after lagoon plane crash
While it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane, now the airline that piloted the plane that crashed into the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia claims one man is missing.
Air Niugini said in a statement that it had been unable to locate one male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The air carrier did not immediately reply to questions about passenger details such as age and nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water on landing at Chuuk Island Airfield.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday but were in a stable condition.
The circumstances of the accident and the exact chain of events are still unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed far from the lagoon runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane landed very low.
"That's very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the other passengers were able to wade through waist-high water to an emergency exit on a sinking plane.
He mentioned that the cabin crew was panicking and screaming, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy and the sailors who worked on the nearby pier also helped in the rescue by using inflatable boats to bring people ashore before the plane sank some 100 feet [30 m] into the water.
Aviation safety network data show that 111 people have died in air accidents involving airlines registered on PNG in the last two decades, but none of them were related to Air Niugin.
Analyst draws up a schedule for the evening when the woman was burned alive
The prosecutor's office on Saturday closed a case against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst for the U.S. Department of Justice, spent several hours as an expert observer analyzing intelligence.
He pointed out to jurors how he used cell phone records to recreate the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said she had received location information from several mobile phones indicating that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting the young man’s earlier claims.
When the data showed that he had been with Chambers, the young man himself had claimed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, so the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford entered the courtroom on Saturday and admitted that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis had been telling the truth when he said he had been in Sanford’s car, Sanford said Tellis was “lying because my car was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
The phone records showed that the women had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett claimed that shortly after Chambers’ death, Tellis deleted Chambers’ messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He cut her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to deliver its verdict on Sunday.
The judge said he thinks the case will go to a jury later in the day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip-Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to combat the negative genre definition by adding positive messages to the music.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip-hop has distanced itself from its roots in political messages and social problem-solving.
They want to go back to the roots of hip-hop and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Bands such as The Fugees and Common have recently regained popularity in the UK thanks to bands such as Akala and Lowkey.
Yet another black man?
New York Babysitter Sues Couple in Court for Racist Message
A New York nanny is suing for discriminatory dismissal after a couple accidentally received a message from their mother complaining that the nanny is “another black person.”
The couple denies that they are racist, compared to the situation with blackmail.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her displeasure when she learned that their new childcare provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on her first day in 2016.
Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to her husband saying, "EIIIIIIIIIIIIIII, REGULAR BLACK."
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
According to the New York Post, the uncomfortable Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice after realizing his blunder, claiming that their sociable nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and was expecting a Filipino in her place.
Ms. Maurice was paid one working day and then sent home with Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple to get compensation for the dismissal, which he hopes to receive on a daily basis in the amount of $350 for the next six months, and the same job he was initially hired to do, but without a contract.
“I want to show them that look, so do it,” he told The Post, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have rejected claims that they are racists, saying that ending their employment with Maurice was a reasonable thing to do because they feared they could no longer trust him after insulting her.
“My wife sent him something he didn’t mean.
He's not a racist.
“We’re not racists,” her husband Joel Plasco told The Post.
“But would you let your children be held by someone you’ve been rude to, even if it was unintentional?
Your newborn?
Come on."
Commenting on the comparison with blackmail, Plasco said his wife was two months away from the birth of the baby and was “in a very difficult situation.”
“Would you go out with someone like that?”
That's not very nice," added the investment banker.
While the lawsuit is still pending, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media for being heavily criticized for their behavior and thinking.
The new letter reveals that Paddington’s publishers feared readers would not interact with the talking bear.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, wrote: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s really fun to know now what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
She said her father, inspired to write a children’s book about a little teddy bear, worked as a BBC cameraman, would have been optimistic about her rejection of her work, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book’s publication was a sad one for her father’s death last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom he described as “a very important member of our family,” he added that his father was quietly proud of his final success.
“He was a very quiet man, and not a boastful man,” he said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like feeling like your child was accomplishing something: you’re proud of them, even though it’s not really your accomplishment.
I believe he observed Paddington's success in this way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always acknowledged Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
When she disembarked, her daughter was rushed to the hospital in Nice, France, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“They called regularly to say that her daughter was in a very bad condition and that they did not believe she would survive,” said Ms Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nadi, who told me that my daughter would be dead in two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll see you soon.
Soon I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors gave him to keep his heart beating had slowly disappeared and left his body.
He was dead a little while before that, and now the work of all the systems began to stop.
All I had to do was sit there and wait, knowing what was going to happen.
I could not howl, scream, or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep myself together.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was now grieving for her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers who knew nothing of her experiences.
“Nobody knew that,” he said.
“I kept my head down and tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a terrible outburst of compassion for Nadi on that flight.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her.”
Postcards from a grieving woman prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have pasted maps on the Wales Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get support.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he suffered from depression, and 18 when he killed himself.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile would brighten the whole room.”
Despite this, he stopped working before his death because he was “in a very bad place with them.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, “I’m constantly worried that it has a domino effect.”
Ms. Davis created these cards “to let people know that there are people to turn to and talk to, even with a friend.
“Don’t shut up, you have to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms. Davis for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, not long after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt bad or depressed or anything,” she said.
“We noticed a change in his behaviour a few days before Christmas.
He was at his lowest point on Christmas Day – when the kids opened their presents, he had no eye contact with them or anything.”
Ms. Humphreys said that her husband’s death was a terrible trauma for them, but they have to deal with it: “It tears the wound into the whole family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we have to keep going and keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI investigates
“I believed that if we could actually get something he wanted — a limited time and scope of investigation — we might be able to achieve unity,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “fall apart” amid the ongoing partisan stalemate.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance was due to timing.
The midterm elections are in just five weeks, on November 6, and if the Republicans don't do well as expected, they'll be noticeably weakened in their intent to put the man they want at the helm of the world's highest court.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone to call senators, lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
The vote will take place in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast a deciding vote and have Mr. Kavanaugh confirmed by the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors is shrinking under Kim's rule.
South Korean legislation has said the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Convergence of South Korea, said that compared to the number of defectors in 2011 (2706), their number dropped last year (1,127).
Mr. Park said the key factors are stronger border controls between North Korea and China and a larger number of human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
A large number of North Korean defectors have been offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul magazine, more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossing the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized area between the two Koreas.
China takes deserters as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them to their home countries.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of the two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the elimination of the stagnant nuclear weapons.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they pledged to work towards a broadly nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the US of sanctions for lack of progress.
“Without trust in the United States, our country lacks security and under these circumstances we are in no way willing to unilaterally disarm first,” Mr. Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was unfit to judge the Supreme Court.
House opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was “temperately unfit” to serve as a Supreme Court judge.
Pelosi spoke in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but notice that if any woman had performed this way, she would have been called hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening remarks, and when describing his family and his high school years, he almost screamed at times and remained speechless at times.
He also explicitly condemned Democratic Party members on the committee, calling the accusations against him of losing Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election a "grotesque and coordinated reputation killing" organized by angry liberals.
Pelosi said he believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved he was unfit to be a Supreme Court judge because it showed he was biased against Democrats.
“I think he’s disqualifying himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi remained modest when asked if he would try to impeach Kavanaugh if confirmed, should the Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say this much: if he doesn’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he’s not only fit to sit on the Supreme Court, he’s not fit to sit in the court he works in,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act (the Health Act – translator's note) or Roe v. Wade (the court precedent for legalizing abortion – translator's note), as the man is considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would quash some Supreme Court rulings.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical biased person to become a judge and expect us to say if it's not nice," Pelosi said.
Women have to wear it.
It's a fair exchange of words, months and years of boiling anger, and he can't get away with it without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, do you?”
He continued: “I got help from a woman who was somewhere in the chair; she said she cried too when she got angry, but she developed a method that consisted of saying to the person she was talking to when she got angry and started crying, ‘You might think I’m crying because I’m sad.
I'm angry."
And he just kept going.
“I thought it was genius.”
Tears are partially accepted as an expression of rage because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories is of an early job in an office with a majority of men, where I once found myself crying in indescribable rage when an older woman – a strict driver I had always been a little afraid of – grabbed me by the collar and dragged me to the stairwell.
“Don’t ever let them see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and it gives them satisfaction.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Party congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on board the Monkey Business yacht and ended the campaign, deeply upset Schroeder thought there was no reason why he shouldn’t think about running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates and the last thing they needed was someone to join.”
Someone said it was like “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As the campaign was coming to an end, he was too late to raise the money, and he vowed not to run unless he received a total of $2 million.
It was a hopeless battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters, who donated $1,000 to the men, only gave him $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” he thought.
When he gave a speech announcing that he would not launch a formal campaign, his feelings — his gratitude to the people who supported him, his irritability to the system that made it difficult to raise money and appeal to voters instead of delegates, and his anger at sexism — overcame him to the point of tears coming down his throat.
“You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder said of the press’s reaction to him.
“You would have thought Kleenex would be my sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they wrote on my tombstone.
“She was crying?”
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Benefit Beijing
The opening shots of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and while the battle is far from over, experts say the split between the two countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning shot this year, imposing taxes on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week with new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods, effectively imposing taxes on half of all goods coming from China to the US.
Beijing has retaliated every time, most recently by imposing tariffs of between 5% and 10% on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has promised to respond to the U.S. shot in the arm, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to blink anytime soon.
To get Washington to retreat would be to yield to the demands, but openly bowing to the US would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, a trade war with the U.S. could support China in the long run, reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions leading to a loss of control of the economy in another country is actually much more dangerous than bystanders have previously admitted,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Center for New American Security that focuses on Asian research.
Foreign Minister: Syria ready for return of refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country after more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country would improve.
“Today, the situation on the territory of the country is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government will continue to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to return to normalcy.
All the conditions are now in place for refugees who have left the country voluntarily because of terrorism and because of unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly accept help to rebuild a devastated country.
At the same time, he stressed that the country would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the US team at Le Golf National near Paris in a 16.5 vs 10.5 win.
The U.S. has now lost six consecutive European titles and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn scored the necessary 14.5 points to defeat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, the US star who was all over the tournament, hit 16 waters on par-3, giving up the win to Francesco Molinar.
Italian golfer Molinari shined in all his rounds, becoming one of only four players to have scored a 5-0 :0 in the tournament's current format, which began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5&4 by Denmark’s Thorbjorn Olesen, who was the lowest position in the European team.
World's best player Dustin Johnson beat Englishman Ian Poulter by 2 and 1, who could finish last in the Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cup veterans, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most-winning European with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help myself.
It's been a tough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy we got the trophy back.
It’s about team spirit and I’m happy to have been able to help,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot Jon Rahm, who on Sunday won the US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a singles match.
“I’m incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods – I grew up watching him,” Rahm, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career Ryder Cup score of 13:21:3.
Odd statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 grand prix titles, only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team was struggling to find fairways for the entire weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after the team’s disappointing performance: “I’m proud of the guys, they were tough.
There were moments in the morning when we put pressure on the Europeans.
We fought them.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players did a great job.
We're gonna get our act together, work with the American PGA and we're gonna work with the Ryder Cup Committee, and we're gonna move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to put on your hat.
We played better.”
New information on water bloom: concentration decreased in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The most recent report from the Florida Commission on Fisheries and Wildlife (FWC) shows a general decrease in the concentration of flowering algae in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, there have been reports of more patchy blooms in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier counties, suggesting declining concentrations.
The extent of the water bloom is approximately 130 miles (209 km) along the coast from the northern part of Pinellas County to the southern part of Lee County.
Spots can be found 10 miles (16 km) off the coast of Hillsborough County, but there are fewer spots than last week.
Water has also been reported in Pasco County.
Over the past week, there have been reports of average concentrations on the coast or offshore in Pinellas County, low to high concentrations on the offshore in Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations on the coast and offshore in Sarasota County, background to high concentrations in Charlotte County, background to medium concentrations in Colmer County, and
There are continuing reports of respiratory irritation in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in Northwest Florida during the past week.
