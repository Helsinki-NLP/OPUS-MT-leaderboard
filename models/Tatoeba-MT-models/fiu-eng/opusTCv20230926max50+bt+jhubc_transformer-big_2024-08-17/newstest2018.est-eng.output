Four members of Kemerovo group arrested in Estonia and Spain
According to Postimees, the police in Spain detained the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group operating in the Estonian underworld, Slava Gulevich, known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovski.
Gulevich, who was arrested in Spain, was arrested with the court’s permission.
Yesterday, the court also arrested three suspects detained in Estonia.
The suspects are members of the so-called Kemerovo criminal organisation, aged between 27 and 57, who are mainly involved in drug-related crimes.
The alleged leader of a criminal organisation was detained in Mijas, in the Spanish province of Malaga.
Three men were detained in Estonia as suspects, one of whom is, according to the data collected, a leading figure of a criminal organisation and two are members of a criminal organisation.
The data collected suggests that the tasks and roles in the criminal organisation were clearly allocated.
The aim of the activities of the criminal organisation was to commit drug offences and thereby earn criminal income," said Vahur Verte, the head of the pre-trial procedure in the criminal case.
"We do not rule out an increase in the number of suspects in this criminal case," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have been in the interest of law enforcement in the past, and some of them have served sentences for drug offences.
Mr Verte stressed that cooperation with his Spanish colleagues had been important throughout the investigation.
“International co-operation has become commonplace for us, and this week’s operation demonstrates the success of the co-operation,” prosecutor Verte said.
The head of the Central Criminal Police, Ago Leis, said the detentions were preceded by a preliminary investigation that lasted for nearly a year and a half.
"In the first half of the week, the long-term work was realised and we simultaneously detained suspects of crimes in Estonia and Spain," he said.
Leis added that Central Criminal Police officers were instrumental in detaining him in Spain.
For years now, we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard.
These detentions are yet another message to the criminals that we can catch them from the other side of Europe," Leis said.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that the men who were suspected may continue to commit new crimes while still at large, which is why the prosecutor’s office requested their arrest and the court approved it.
The man arrested in Spain is awaiting his extradition to Estonia.
Real estate, vehicles and cash have been seized to secure the confiscation in this case.
Pre-trial proceedings in criminal cases are conducted by the Central Criminal Police’s Organised Crime Bureau and headed by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
In 2005, the Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevich of extortion and sentenced him to five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world after the then underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevich, who came from Kemerovo, rose to prominence in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s when he began to deal with blackmail in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes at various hotels and demanded a monthly roofing fee from businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscations of proceeds of crime and court judgments in force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest court judgments, the eight defendants separated from the so-called Dikayev criminal case, who were confiscated EUR 80 000 in criminal proceeds, or the court judgment against nine persons for Igor Aleynikov's creation in 2006 of a criminal association aimed at the illegal trade in contraband cigarettes and the commission of crimes related to human trafficking in Ida-Viru County and Southern Estonia.
The amount of confiscated proceeds is approximately 71,500 euros.
Success in these cases has been ensured by the fact that police officers exchange information and evidence with foreign colleagues on a daily basis and, if necessary, take action together in any country of the European Union.
Civil Rights Group Warns of Traveling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people traveling to Missouri against discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group said in a statement: “The NAACP Travel Notice for Missouri, effective until August 28, 2017, calls on all African-American travelers, visitors, and Missourians to be particularly alert and extremely cautious when traveling throughout the state, given the range of suspicious racial events that have occurred throughout the state.”
According to the NAACP, the group was prompted to issue a travel warning by a recent Missouri law, which makes it harder to win cases of discrimination, as well as the fact that the state’s law enforcement officers are disproportionately targeting minorities.
“People’s civil rights are being violated.
They are pulled to the side of the road because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed,” Rod Chapel, president of the NAACP Missouri branch, told The Kansas City Star newspaper.
“We’ve never had so many complaints before.”
This is the first such warning the organization has issued against a U.S. state.
The group referred to such events as racist insults against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while driving through the state and was arrested by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the note refers to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General, which shows that black drivers in the state are 75% more likely to be stopped than white drivers.
“Notes are meant to make people aware and alert their families, friends, and coworkers about what might be happening in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People need to be prepared, whether it’s taking bail money or telling relatives they’re going through the state.”
Based on the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, placing the state at number 16 in the cross-section of the state in terms of similar violations.
The travel alert is also a response to Missouri’s new law, which makes it harder for a company to sue for discrimination in the search for housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel notes for Texas and Arizona after those states passed immigration laws obliging local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because, according to the ACLU, this increases racial profiling.
Usually, the State Department issues travel warnings about other countries, but recently, interest groups have begun to use this measure in response to certain domestic laws and trends.
Hepatitis: what could everyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver, can be caused by five different types of hepatitis A, B, C, D and E viruses.
All these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C can develop into liver cirrhosis, or liver wrinkling, and liver cancer.
The epidemiology adviser of the Health Board, Kuulo Kutsar, says that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver inflammation – fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, greyish stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes.
The last symptom of the disease also comes from the popular name of hepatitis jaundice.
In children, hepatitis can pass without signs of the disease.
Different types of hepatitis can be determined only on the basis of data from a laboratory study.
Acute hepatitis can transform into chronic hepatitis and progress for decades without symptoms, which means that a person may not know anything about his dangerous liver-damaging disease.
Kuulo Kutsar brings out the different forms of hepatitis and describes their course in more detail.
Hepatitis viruses spread from a sick person and infect us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, by having sex, by dropping the infected person’s stools on hands and from hands to food, surfaces, objects, getting into the mouth, and by using drugs.
The risk group of hepatitis A infection includes family members and caregivers of the affected person, people with chronic liver disease, people who have sex with an infected person, men who have sex with men, drug addicts, and travelers visiting countries with high prevalence of hepatitis A.
The infection can be prevented by vaccination, in particular, vaccination is recommended for people who travel a lot and are at risk for hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands, wash all fruits and vegetables before eating.
Hepatitis B viruses are spread through contact with the blood of a sick person, injection of drugs, tattooing, piercing, use of blood-contaminated household products (tooth brushes, shaving devices), sex with a donor blood, a person who is suspected of having hepatitis, and from the mother to the fetus/newborn child who is ill with hepatitis.
The risk group for hepatitis B infection includes injecting drug users, sexual partners of the infected person, men who have sex with men, newborn babies of the infected mother, sick family members and caregivers, health care workers, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, and travellers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis B disease.
In order to prevent hepatitis B, it is possible to vaccinate people; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people at risk, as well as people with chronic liver diseases, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures against hepatitis B include: refraining from using foreign hygiene and manicure equipment, other sharps and needles, tattooing and piercing, and using condoms for sex that is potentially infectious, or avoiding risky sexual behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunization program in Estonia and is free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are spread through contact with the blood of a sick person, injection of drugs, tattooing, piercing, use of blood-contaminated household fluids, sex with a donor, hepatitis suspect person, and from the mother to the fetus/newborn child.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injecting drug users, sexual partners of the infected person, men who have sex with men, newborn babies of the infected mother, sick family members and caregivers, health care workers, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other bodily fluids, persons with HIV infection, and travellers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis C disease.
Hepatitis C prevention measures include: Avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicure products, other sharps and needles, tattooing and piercing, and using condoms in case of unsafe sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which multiplies in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection occurs with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Hepatitis D viruses are spread by contact with blood and other body fluids, contaminated syringes and needles, by sexual contact, and rarely by infection from the mother to the fetus.
The risk group of hepatitis D is chronic carriers of hepatitis B virus and people who do not have immunity to hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with a hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects a person from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis E viruses are spread by faecal-oral route through drinking water and food, including eating low-heat-treated beef, fish and shellfish, with donor blood, with shared syringes, and from an infected mother to the fetus.
Travelers can become infected with hepatitis E in countries with high rates of the disease.
Prevention measures for hepatitis E include compliance with hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for the sick.
Wash fruits and vegetables before consumption, avoid eating little heat-treated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water, and refrain from using drugs.
In the final lap, while the competitors tried to push the four-time Olympic champion off the track, the 34-year-old Farah found strength on the final lap and won with a time of 26.49.51.
Farah didn’t think long, dragging her husband Tania and her children to the track with her after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
It was wonderful to be on the track with them," Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for the gold double of the 5,000 and 10,000 metres for the fifth consecutive title race in London.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's Lady in Gold: An Extraordinary Story of Gustav Klimt's Masterpiece, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, dives far beyond the story of the birth of one work of art into the cultural life of Vienna in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
But more profoundly in history.
The awe-inspiring amount of information could have used a harder cut-off ax, a narrower subject, and let the extraordinary story of the portrait promised in the title have more effect.
At the moment, there are two books between the covers: the story of Gustav Klimt and Adele Bloch-Bauer depicted in her painting Lady in Gold, and a much larger and more comprehensive history book about respected Jewish families and the German occupation with its after-effects in Austria.
The first third of the book takes you to the bustling cultural life of Vienna, and those who found themselves in the Austrian capital can easily imagine how life around Ringstrasse went on more than a hundred years ago, or how everything turned around in Central Café when Klimt walked in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the richest cities in Europe, and when you see the familiar name in the book, you feel a bit more cultured.
At the same time, the fact that Sigmund Freud operated in a city with incurable syphilis and the highest suicide rate in Europe does not seem to add anything to the development of the story.
Or perhaps every couple-sentence brushstroke adds colour to the cultural life of Vienna at the beginning of the 20th century.
A trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost every tenth inhabitant of Vienna was a Jew.
Adele's parents were also newcomers to Vienna, but by the time Adele married the twice-opened Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch and posed for Klimt's famous paintings, his father's bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adele wasn’t drawn to the glamorous life she belonged to.
Looking at "The Lady in Gold", it is hard to believe that towards the end of her life this great lady was infected by socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order a portrait of his wife from Klimt, the last moment was the hottest painter in Vienna.
At the time, Klimt’s order cost 4,000 kroons, a quarter of the price of a well-located country house.
The fact that some of the portraits were suspected of having a master’s affair with a model did not discourage the sugar magnate.
As for Adele, the only certain fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist that arose during the work continued for the rest of her life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "The Lady in Gold.
The extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt’s masterpiece, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer”, Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Shortly before the start of the work with Adele, Klimt had been to the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, and researchers believe that the brilliant mosaics of Empress Theodora that he had just seen there gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adele in the form of a painted mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Lady in Gold" in Vienna in 1908, and around the same time (between 1907 and 1908) another golden painting "Kiss" was born.
The similarity of the two women did not go unnoticed by art historians.
What does this have to do with Hitler?
“In memory of my friend Klimt, I think I owe it to him to make his handiwork available to the public,” Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote to the director of the Belvedere Museum a few years after the artist’s departure (Klimt died in February 1918) and wanted their family’s Klimt collection to go to the museum.
Six years before his death, Klimt had another portrait of Adele.
In her will (Adele left in February 1925), she also asked her husband to leave her two portraits and four paintings by Gustav Klimt at the Austrian Gallery.
He bequeathed his jewelry to his nieces Maria and Luise.
A year after Klimt graduated from the Austrian Mona Lisa, 17-year-old Adolf Hitler had tried to get into the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, but failed at the drawing bar.
Although Hitler’s later anti-Semitism is sometimes attributed to the fact that he was not accepted into the academy by Jewish professors, none of his examiners were actually Jews.
In any case, the task of the Austrian Gallery referred to in Maria’s will had changed considerably by 1939 – it had become important to find works that the Nazi parties liked from Vienna’s rich Jewish art collections.
Some of Adele's works at home, but not Klimt's, were also suitable for Hitler's personal art collection.
Sixty years after the Nazi art heists, a ten-year litigation began between the Austrian government and the Bloch-Bauer heirs.
It should be noted that while the Kiss can be seen at the Belvedere Palace in Vienna, Adele Bloch-Bauer’s “Lady in Gold” should be seen at the Neue Galerie in New York.
And before the trip to Vienna, read the above-mentioned book.
Even if you don’t plan on going to see Klimt’s work, at least my emotions revolved more around Nazi and Jewish themes after the book closed than around the painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer, which sold for 135 million dollars.
So not so much a portrait, but rather a family fate story - and a very moving story.
The Bauer family tree, mentioned at the beginning of the book, significantly facilitated the orientation of the events.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
In live swimming, Gold was very close to his personal 200m backstroke record of 2.16.62.
The top mark came a week ago at the age of 17, when the time at the Canadian Junior Championships was 2.16.58, Priit Aavik told Swimming Blog.
Gold was the last to reach the A-finals.
In the final, he finished the race with a time of 2.15.76 and finished seventh with a powerful new top mark.
Alina Kendzior’s Estonian record (2.15,13) was just over half a second away from Gold.
In Estonia’s all-time ranking, Gold came in third and his fresh personal top mark is Estonia’s fifth all-time result.
A young hope for the future is still starting in the 100 m, 200 m and 400 m freestyle and 200 m and 400 m complex swimming at the Canadian Adult Championships.
Last week, the Canadian Junior Championships were held in Toronto, and Gold made a successful start there as well.
He won the silver medal in the 200 m freestyle with a time of 2.03.22.
This was the last time the Estonians swam this distance so fast in 2008.
Only the Estonian record holder Elina Partyt<0xC3><0xB5>ka has ever swam faster than Gold in Estonia.
The Estonian woman living in Canada also won a bronze medal in the 100m freestyle with a great personal record and a new Estonian season top mark of 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, who is a year older than her, has swam this distance only one hundredth faster.
He reached his personal top mark in the 100m backstroke by receiving a message in the opening relay of the relay at 1.03.69.
In the half-longer distance, he only finished seventh when he swam in the final at 2.17.31.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season at four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics brush their teeth
The holidays are here - that means relaxation for US President Donald Trump as well.
But as Trump has been one of the most popular holiday pickers, critics are already brushing their teeth.
USA Today and CNN say the president is planning a 17-day vacation at a golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
While the president’s vacation began yesterday, Trump’s opponents have been talking about the holiday for a week now.
They blame Trump for taking too much time off.
The president spends his weekends in his villas in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
Trump is not the most relaxed president in his 196 days in office.
George W. Bush has been on vacation for 67 days, compared to only 21 days for Barack Obama.
Trump, however, is quick to forget.
Days after becoming president, Trump said on his 60-minute show that there would be no time for long vacations during his amphibian, as there was so much work to be done.
Three years ago, President Barack Obama took a vacation.
The current president tweeted: “While Obama is on vacation, playing golf, attending parties and jazz concerts, ISIS is chopping off the heads of journalists.”
White House officials say a 17-day golf club visit isn't exactly relaxing.
It’s officially called a work holiday, during which Trump doesn’t have time for reading or other favorite activities.
There must have been another reason for the holiday.
The air-conditioning system in the west wing of the White House will be replaced and all staff will have to leave.
The Oval Office and other offices of the President are also located in the western wing.
“I don’t think any of you would want to be in the west wing in August if it’s 38 degrees and there’s no air conditioning,” said White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters.
Where President Trump will spend the next 17 days can be seen in the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook don’t run for state office if you can’t stand criticism from voters
The father of our country knew a lot about unfavorable media coverage.
The American people loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to beat him up about everything from domestic politics to his policies.
Criticism, of course, irritated him.
But he did not force his critics to remain silent.
For in 1783 Washington said that "freedom of speech may be taken away from us, and silently and silently we may be led, like sheep, to slaughter."
Which brings me to Larry Hogan, the governor of Maryland, who has to work hard to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s employees have blocked and deleted at least 450 people who posted their opinions on his official Facebook page.
Earlier this week, he was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
The case was dismissed by the governor’s office, and online commentaries were teeming with reactions in the form of “Who cares?”
"It's just Facebook," many said.
But it does matter.
And it matters a lot when it comes to a man like Hogan.
He's an amazingly popular Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state.
His approval percentage is the second best among the 50 governors in the country.
Hogan is not an unthinking reactionary whimper.
He has led the state with a firm hand and has stood firm in his principles.
In addition, he has been quite adept at using Facebook as the main tool for communicating with his voters, for example, presenting his bald head cheerfully for the first time since chemotherapy.
Thus, the governor’s page, which is an officially-marked public forum run by taxpayers’ dollar-paying staff, blocking people from visiting is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan’s spokesman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor’s behavior in an interview with The Washington Post, arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it’s too easy to paint a picture of online trolls, spammers, or angry people.
The Post spoke to several real people that Hogan had blocked.
And that's exactly what they are, real people who interact with their chosen leaders -- teachers, business owners, and pastors, not internet trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and by no means obscene.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, emphasizing Hogan’s Catholicism.
Lakshmi Sarma Raman, a lawyer from Bowie, Maryland, did not incite hatred, but real hate crimes.
“I politely commented that I was disappointed that he had not responded to hate crimes or other recent news,” she wrote in the Post’s comment section.
“I also don’t like the idea that when a large number of people comment on the same topic, someone will immediately indifferently call it a collective effort instead of acknowledging that it’s a large number of concerned citizens.”
What the governor’s office called a “directed spam attack,” others would probably call “public support.”
The Facebook era allows you to easily match messages by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It’s much cleaner than it used to be, when you had to send out workers to do the same thing, so that they would gather up the newspapers with critical editorials and burn them, or arrest the protesters and force them to remain silent.
But that’s exactly what’s happening now, just digitally.
Hogan isn’t the first government official to be criticized for toothing Facebook and other social media.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who have been blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first landmark judgments on this subject was made last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria ruled that the chairwoman of Loudoun County Oversight Board violated the First Amendment when she blocked a voter from her Facebook page.
In Kentucky, the ACLU also visited Governor Matt Bevin (R) for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington, D.C., affordable postage had a similar effect to the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and anonymous writers pounded his style of management.
And even then, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius, razing Washington to the ground.
According to historical documents gathered by George Washington’s online letter collection project, his office was buried under petitions criticizing his views on the friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Britain.
But he did not force them to remain silent.
Freedom of expression, dissent and debate are the foundations of our country.
And right leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty Hopes for Homeland Comfort at Renaissance Club
Former European number one Ronan Rafferty is hoping for the comfort of home territory over the next three days when the 25th Scottish Senior Open takes place at the East Lothian Renaissance Club golf courses.
The Northern Irishman, who was in charge of the neighbouring Archerfield Links circuit last year before his descent to Paul Eales, is fond of the new venue and will replace the club’s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi as the tournament’s ambassador.
“I saw how the Renaissance Club was built, and now we’re going to see how the club shines with this event in all its glory,” Rafferty said.
"Players see the track in its best shape, it is in a brilliant condition.
Jerry's done a great job building this place.
He is an avid supporter of golf and is proud of what he has achieved here.
This allows the track to be presented excellently."
Englishman Everes is looking forward to defending the title for the first time, even though he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
“It’s a very special feeling,” said the Southport based player.
“I couldn’t defend my Extremadura Open title because it was taken off the calendar a year after my win.
It's magical to come back to this part of the world.
This is a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year, for me and my wife Sharon, last year's victory was special.
It was a very special time that we will always carry in our hearts.”
Gary Orr, who joined the seniors’ European tour earlier this year when he turned 50, will return to the competition.
This is his first event in Scotland since he took part in the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"Playing at home is always a little more meaningful," said Orr, a man from Helensburgh.
“You want to perform well, but you also feel extra pressure.
I’ve enjoyed playing again and I’ve played a good game of golf.
I’m happy with the way things have been going so far.”
The trio will be joined on the field by former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and senior tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six competing Scots, the rest being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entrance is free, and parking costs <0xC2><0xA3>5 for a one-passenger car and <0xC2><0xA3>10 for a two- or more-passenger car.

Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Rich Land
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
He rarely even uses a potty.
In a wooden cottage in Enarotal, the capital of the reluctant Paniai regency in Papua, Indonesia, a housewife places a sweet potato called nota, in the local language, right on the fire.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed from the fire and eagerly eaten with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor with no furniture and does her daily chores, such as washing laundry with turbid water from a nearby swamp.
A bucket in an unroofed room plays the role of a toilet.
Since she is the youngest of her husband’s four wives, she is not assigned to any field.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous, however, as most of the men in the village are unemployed and many of them drink heavily, and there are also soldiers here.
"No one dares to go around the village after five o'clock in the evening," he says.
This is a rare glimpse of life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was incorporated into Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum in which only 1,026 elderly people were forced to vote in front of the occupiers.
The movement, which encouraged the liberation of the Dutch from domination, quickly turned its rage against the government of Jakarta, which continues to keep the region under its strong control, keeping away from foreign journalists and human rights watchdogs.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, leaving the eastern part of the island to independent Papua New Guinea.
Enarotal is both a remote and abandoned place. To get here, you have to fly 90 minutes from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then take a five-hour journey that will make you sick with a rental car.
There is no public transport.
With a population of about 19,000, the city consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fencing and covered with wavy iron roofs, whose rust has turned various shades of yellowish-brown.
Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, let alone journalists, and hardly any foreigners have been here either.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the Papuans of Mee Pago worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
“We weren’t used to wearing such clothes,” Degei says, referring to his colorful hand-woven turban, dark blouse, and bright skirt.
"Before that, we used to wear only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of people living below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy statistics are among the worst in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia’s golden land.
Just 100 km from Pania, a mountainous province of about 153,000 people in New Jersey, lies the world’s largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based company Freeport McMoran.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can boast of consumable wood reserves estimated at USD 78 billion.
But these riches are the source of Papuan suffering, as they result in the suffocating presence of a powerful Indonesian army.
A 2005 study by The New York Times found that Freeport paid local military personnel and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 per officer.
This golden goose is threatened by the Papuans’ efforts to secure greater autonomy, and they are mercilessly treated.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass killings in the highlands of the Papuan tribes in the 1970s were the equivalent of genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the area.
The 2016 report by the Archbishopric of Birsbane, “We Will Lose Everything,” contains testimonies of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (according to another report, rape and electric shocks are particularly prevalent) and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims because these kinds of incidents happen every week,” said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The screws have been tightened even more, as Papua’s natural resources have led to an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
83% of the province’s 3.5 million inhabitants are Christian, but the demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia’s crowded islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese family canteens sell gado-gado with crispy chicken and mixed vegetables, served with peanut sauce.
The locals can't compete with them.
“Migrants began selling chicken and vegetables on the traditional market at lower prices than local beans,” explains 24-year-old Abeth You, born in Paniai, who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.
"The native Papuan mama-mama [women] are therefore losing market share."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who is popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address these inequalities and human rights violations in Papua in his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter won 27 of the 29 constituencies, including Paniai, on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But very little has changed in Papua and the locals feel betrayed.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokow in the expectation that he would live up to our hopes of restoring justice,” You says.
In fact, just two months after Jokowi took office in October, Paniai was in a slump.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children were singing Christmas carols on a fire in Enarotal when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on a motorcycle in the darkness.
Shocked children told them they should turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone of voice and later returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and witnesses, drunken soldiers chased children and beat them with the handles of their rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot at the children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby Electoral Commission building was set on fire, and the next day things escalated even further.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women, and children rallied for justice on a football field in front of the local police station and military command center.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance of the Papuan honey pago tribe, during which they ran around and imitated birdsong.
Some protesters began throwing stones at police and military personnel.
"If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them," according to an official document seen by TIME magazine, but not issued to local media outlets.
Yeremias Kayame (56), the elder of the district of Kego Koto in Enarotal, sensed the threat and called for peace, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
"When I turned around, I was shot in the left wrist," he told TIME magazine in his brightly colored treehouse porch.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers.
"There were a lot of people, there were a lot of shots," he added.
Alfius Youw, a local man, was shot three times, according to a cousin who witnessed the shooting.
“I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” Yohanes, who like many Indonesians, uses only one name, told TIME magazine.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Yotje Mende, Chief Inspector of the Papuan Police Force, told reporters that his officers only guaranteed the security of their department, as it was under attack.
“We must defend ourselves if we are threatened with death,” said Pudjo Sulistiyo, a Papuan police spokesman.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The news of the killings did not reach Jakarta until the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promising to address the abuses that have taken place in Papua.
"I want to solve this case now so that it will never happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Wiranto announced that he would establish an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve crimes against human rights.
Almost immediately, however, the excuses followed.
Most of the crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of these occurred in the 1990s and early 2000s.
“We are committed to solving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes,” he said.
Speaking to TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5 June, however, Wiranto retracted his comments, saying that he had no intention of setting up a mechanism to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, “everything will be settled according to the law.”
Wiranto, who has been accused by the United Nations of human rights crimes over the deaths of more than 1,000 people in Timor-Leste during the bloody 1999 independence referendum, said that 11 human rights crimes had already been solved in Papua, including those in Pania.
The families of the victims of Paniai accepted such claims with grim disbelief.
“I’ve been interrogated four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made,” Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid the military will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed that the people of Paniai were afraid to dissect the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping bury four victims.
"After the bodies were buried, the army came looking for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighboring Deiyai province.
One person was killed and 17 injured, including children, when a row broke out between villagers and the construction company manager, who refused to transport the unconscious man to the hospital.
This man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died en route to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company’s office at the construction site.
Police said villagers threw stones at police officers, who responded with warning shots.
But according to locals, a mobile brigade (Indonesian military police) began shooting at a crowd, killing one person.
"We were in a big panic, we're afraid of revenge," 29-year-old Domingo Badii, who lives near the hospital, told TIME magazine.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the prosecution of the police officers involved and for the withdrawal of a mobile police brigade from the region.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of meaningful development is fuelling the discontent of the honey, Moni, Dani, and Damal tribes living in the verdant highlands of Papua.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement's (VPL) rebel army, which says it defends the rights of the Papuans by occasionally carrying out attacks and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the leaders of the VPL are from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, under the pretext of "defending state sovereignty", the military has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of people in Paniais in recent years.
Some of them will never show up again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniad is known as the "tragic forgotten place".
Poverty breeds discontent.
The little rice that is sold in Enarotal is too expensive for locals to buy.
Bread is just as inaccessible.
People grow all their food themselves mainly sweet potatoes, in addition to a little fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom is able to care for four or five sweet potato fields.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has deepened between indigenous Papuans and new migrants, who have been arriving in abundance since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist go to better educated and wealthier migrants.
Papuans themselves often lack the capital or skills to run a competitive business.
“Young people are not interested in staying here because there are no jobs and no money,” says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
There are also severe restrictions on foreign media.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua because "they did not observe the relevant practices", although they had been given a rare permission to film.
Phelim Kine, deputy head of Human Rights Watch’s Asia department, said Jokow’s election pledges to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development had not been implemented.
"Journalists trying to report from Papua's most troubled eastern provinces and West Papua in Indonesia face new threats of visa rejection and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of press scrutiny means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government is largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific nations—Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and Solomon Islands—stimulated the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “various widespread crimes” in Papua, including the shooting of Paniai.
These same countries have historically supported the VPL.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's accusations, telling reporters in Jakarta that "democracy and freedom of the press remain in place in Indonesia, making it difficult to bury evidence of human rights violations."
The local people want more attention from foreign governments.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the country's human rights envoy Kees Van Bar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, the local people broke their silence, according to a source who was present at the meeting but who wished to remain anonymous, urging them: "We want freedom."
Indonesia will hold another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans do not believe they will vote for Jokow again.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting of Paniai," said Hobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokow to understand that not only are the people of Paniai constantly living under the threat of the predatory army, but they are also suffering from poor education and health services.
According to Gobai, the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, regard their vote for Jokow as a debt to be repaid.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the shooting victims of Paniai managed to carry out yet another symbolic insurrection by burying the body of one of the victims on the ground opposite the police station and military base.
Knowing that justice may never be done, they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," Yacobus says with his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
The Dubai Torch skyscraper has been destroyed by fire for the second time.
A fire swept through one of the world’s tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter-high, 79-story building.
This is the second fire that in just two years has devastated a high-rise building that happens to be called the Torch.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct cause of fire was reported.
"We slept and woke up to the fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor,” a resident who called himself George told Reuters.
Dubai’s civil defense officials said firefighters had extinguished the flame at around 4 a.m. local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working to provide shelter for the victims.
This incident may once again raise questions around the world about the safety of materials used on the exterior of high-rise buildings.
An investigation conducted by the Torch Board after the fire in 2015 found that the most damage was sustained by the facade cladding – exterior decorative panels and insulation.
British police have said they believe the insulation and fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade panels at London’s Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire there in June, which killed around 80 people.
These phones are expected to be on sale in the summer.
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for tech fans as phone manufacturers unveil their new top models.
The Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium are on sale in the spring, and new hit phones are also expected to be available in the autumn.
According to Kristjan Seema, Director of Marketing and Sales at Tele2, this year’s flagships are characterised by an innovative design, an iris scanner, a 4K edge-to-edge display and an ultra-fast processor.
The Samsung Galaxy S8 has also made it to the top of the Estonian smartphone sales charts.
Autumn promises even faster fast charging, a more durable battery, a higher quality camera and increased water and dust resistance for smart enthusiasts.
He added that it is already possible to make assumptions based on rumors and predict four top models that are likely to dominate this year’s sales charts.
These four top smartphone models will be available in stores in the autumn of this year.
The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are expected to arrive in mid-September.
Rumors about what the new Apple model will look like and what can be done with it, however, are spreading a lot.
While the iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences compared to the iPhone 6s, then for Apple's tenth birthday, it is expected that the new model will be completely different from the previous ones.
There are four colors: black, white, pink gold and chrome.
One of the elements of the new design is probably the screen, which covers the entire front of the phone, the lost home button and the fingerprint reader is built into the screen.
Apple’s head of design, JonyIve, is demanding that the new iPhone model look like smooth glass.
There is also a ceramic version of the iPhone.
In addition to the iris scanner, wireless charging and even higher quality camera, a faster A11 processor can be expected.
This is definitely one of the most anticipated smartphones of the year.
Pre-orders for the all-new Galaxy Note 8 will begin on August 23.
There’s been a lot of talk about what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
It is said that even more is intended for the business user, and the S Pen allows even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one of which is a wide-angle and the other a telephoto lens with a narrower field of view.
At the moment, no one knows what the two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung's first test, which is certainly comparable in quality to the iPhone 8.
We look forward to August 23rd.
While Nokia has launched three smartphones this year, led by the Nokia 6, what is still missing is their flagship, the Nokia 8, which will be unveiled on August 16.
We’re expecting a 5.3-inch edge-to-edge screen from Nokia, a super-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, and a more durable battery.
In the case of Nokia, there is also talk of an aluminum housing and a significant degree of water and dust resistance IP68.
Similar to Samsung, the new model of Nokia has two rear cameras, the optics of which are produced by the company Zeiss.
While Sony’s solid flagship has been the XZ Premium so far, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones with even more innovative features will be added in the near future.
We are waiting for a smartphone that is a bit more modest than XZ Premium, but at least with an equally good or better camera.
Sony’s new model has been speculated to have a screen size of at least six inches.
What the reality will bring, we will see very soon, because traditionally Sony has unveiled its autumn flagship at the international technology fair IFA, which this year will take place from 1 to 6 September.
According to leaked transcripts of phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall
The Washington Post released transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders.
On January 27, Trump telephoned Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to ask him to stop publicly declaring that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The American president chided him for publicly condemning the wall, saying, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump built his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed to make Mexico pay for this project.
Transcripts of his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, revealing a tense exchange of views.
Trump told Turnbull that an agreement by the United States to take in refugees heading to Australia was “ridiculous,” “frustrating,” and “stupid.” He claimed that an agreement made during the Obama administration would make him look like a “dumb” because he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States.
Trump ended the call by telling Turnbull it was “the most unpleasant speech of the day.”
The Supreme Court did not hear the complaint of O<0xC3><0x9C> MRP Linna Liinid in which the City of Tartu rejected their offer for the procurement of regular bus services from July 2019 to 2029.
This is a directive by which O<0xC3><0x9C> MRP Linna Liinid rejected an offer in Tartu bus procurement because the offer did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Apuhtin, Head of the Tartu City Government Legal Service.
This is an intra-Tartu public bus service procurement for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
MRP Linna Liinid appealed to the Supreme Court against the Tartu Circuit Court’s decision.
The Supreme Court did not rule on this.
Although many people on social media complain that the noise from the Weekend Festival disturbs their sleep and the whole city is full of drunken partygoers, there are also many who do not have any bad words to say about the festival on the beach.
I'm even positively surprised that the festivities in the store were so polite!
I didn't see any blurryness or rudeness.
I even saw kindness,” says Laine.
"It's nice to see people come, be and feel the joy of Pärnu, which is like a winter's sleep in winter," he adds cheerfully.
The sound of the waves on the beach does not disturb sleep.
While living in the city centre, he still heard that music was being played on the beach, but now the music has not reached his home walls.
"But I hope I can hear you," he says cheerfully.
Agnes, who has also spoken to <0xC3><0x95>htuleht, says that the big festival is rather good for Pärnu - it helps the local merchants a lot.
He is also pleased that so many foreigners have come to visit the summer capital.
The noise of the party doesn't bother the woman.
Although I don't sunbathe on the beach anymore, but it's nice that the beach has come alive.
And it’s great that the crowd is moving, and it’s been three times already,” she says.
The first time was a bit worse.
“Maybe there were complaints,” he thought.
However, he says, the noise on the beach is common for summer residents.
"This Weekend is a very good promotion for our small town," says Harri, who is basking in the park.
The noise and commotion have not shaken his rhythm of life either.
But for what?
We should all stick together.
Think about how this inter-ethnic communication would be better.
Loud music doesn't crush a man.
It doesn't bother me, even though I live nearby.
"Good people can stick together and there's no trouble," he says.
The guests who come to Pärnu are polite, he says.
“Of course they’ve gone a little overboard with the bottles, but young people are young, and my God, let’s go, but be human and we’ll make it!” he says.
By this time, the coastal residents have traveled somewhere far away, either to relatives or acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival has a positive effect on life - people like this kind of noise," says Tiina, who was walking with the children in Pärnu.
His family’s sleep does not disturb the festival music either, although last year it sounded even further than this year.
Last summer the stage was the other way around, then we heard more.
We live outside the city, so it actually sounds quite good by the Pärnu River,” he says.
Pearson Cuts 3,000 More Jobs and Dividends to Revitalize Business
British education company Pearson said Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent, triggering yet another restructuring program to address the company’s looming woes.
The job losses, which, according to CEO John Fallon, will most likely be made redundant at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, will be added to the 4,000 jobs lost in the previous restructuring.
In May, Pearson announced plans to cut costs by an additional <0xC2><0xA3>300 million ($394 million) as part of a third cost-cutting program to try to reinvigorate a business that has been hit by the rapid transition to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell a stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said their expectations for the year have not changed since a 1 percent increase in sales revenue to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion was announced in the first half of the year.

Convoy attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials said.
A NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the city’s Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest in a series of violent incidents in Afghanistan this month, with more than 30 people killed in a Herat mosque attack on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said Thursday night’s explosion occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked “with a man-made explosive device”.
According to the statement, all the injured are in stable condition and are being treated in a US military hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (ISIS) is a serious source of concern for NATO forces in Bagram, Qarabagh.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb in Kabul killed at least 30 people, mostly in a Shiite neighborhood.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On May 31, a major bomb attack in the city center killed more than 150 people — the most deadly military attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban in 2001.
This violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while U.S. President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of U.S. troops helping the country’s military and police.
Correspondents say the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA Cancels Decision to Postpone Smoke Order After Appeals
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reversed its decision to delay the Obama-era regulation that requires states to limit emissions of smog, one day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
The EPA announced its decision to proceed with “Ozone Assessment Procedures 2015” late Wednesday, saying it showed the agency’s commitment to working with states.
“We believe we need to engage in dialogue with and listen to our state partners,” said Scott Pruitt, the EPA’s chief executive.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA’s intention to delay the ozone measurements, which measure smog pollution in different parts of the country, to determine where its level should be reduced by one year until October 2018 in order to meet the stricter air quality standard.
The 15 predominantly Democratic states filed a lawsuit with the District of Columbia on Tuesday, saying the ruling was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration has tried to pull back on a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama. According to Trump, this is part of a broader plan to boost economic growth.
But these efforts have sparked backlash among Democrats and conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of increased pollution on human health.
The EPA’s website states that breathing ozone-containing air “could reduce the working capacity of the lungs and increase the risk of respiratory diseases,” such as asthma.
German pigs can have a party.
German pigs and cattle could be partying, as heavy rains threaten the harvest of the European Union’s second-largest wheat producer, Bloomberg reports.
This year, it may be that weeks of rain before harvest may mean that bread can only be fed to animals.
"The quality of wheat is far worse than last year and worse than in 2015," said Bernhard Chilla, an analyst at Agravis Raiffeisen.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat could be used for animal feed, which is double that of conventional wheat, Agravis predicted.
German farmers, as well as their European colleagues, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
The winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which was replaced by a heat wave in June.
In July, Germany was hit by rainstorms, which have continued into August.
Many have their eyes turned to northern Germany, where rain prevents the harvest.
So far, only 5% of the wheat has been harvested.
Harvesting has not yet begun in most of the area, local harvest buyer Ceravis said.
"It's a pretty difficult day," said Frank Deckert, a senior trader at Ceravis in Rendsburg.
Consistency in everything, or the subtle twists of Finnish interior design
The beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the fair houses, because through the large windows the magnificent views of the shores of Lake Saimaa reach many (life) rooms.
At every step, the ambition of our northern neighbours to create both crisp and perfect (energy-efficient) homes is evident.
It is worth admiring and also adhering to the Finnish people’s skills in using wood as a building and finishing material, and in making furniture and beauty items.
Invigorating techniques and smart solutions can be found in the fair houses by both the builder and the (home) designer.
There it stands out vividly that combinations of shades of black, white and gray, when complemented by wood tones and indoor plants, can be very moody.
Good ideas can be picked up for another week, because the fair lasts until August 13.
Accessories and herbal pots suggest that cooking is common in this kitchen.
The line was drawn for this year’s Weekend Festival Baltic, and Martin Garrix did his best to remember him as the last performer on the main stage.
The crowd was really turning during Garrix's performance - singing, howling, dancing in a self-forgetting way.
When Garrix finished, a mass of people poured out from the beach of Pärnu to the city.
We will bring you a gallery with all the photos that our photographer captured during the three days of the Weekend.
I’m sure you’ll be one of them, so look for yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to face off in the near-future’s most enticing boxing match of up to 66.7 kg in the weight category, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at the ESPN office in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked across the hall to greet Lomachenko, the featherweight champion of the World Boxing Organization.
Following Garcia’s unanimous decision to win over former four-time world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are in the top five of the weight rankings.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
I wish you luck."
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marria on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the couple posed for the photos, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible confrontation between the fighters would be a "perfect measure."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
“I moved up [to 63.5 kg] for Broner, but I’m not that big.
I'm 63.5 kg small.
I want to go below light weight.
And he has to move up to light weight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
The fans wanted it.
Let’s give them that.”
Lomachenko agreed.
"The boxing world needs this fight."
Klimas raised the question of whether it should be paid to watch. This is part of his strategy to let Lomachenko debut in a class of 61.2 kg towards the end of this year, in order to make it possible for him to meet Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) next summer, who is also interested in fighting the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their lightweight title round on 23 September Forum
“Watching this fight could be pay-per-view as fans have wanted this confrontation,” Garcia said in a statement, saying he was open to fighting on any channel that offered the best financial package.
“We are the main players.
No other name can get so much attention.
Whenever they're ready..."
Garcia said he considered Lomachenko a “great fighter” and could go see his Saturday match.
Lomachenko, however, was modest in his praise of Garcia, saying that in his mind, the champion of the three divisions from Riverside looked "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted that knockout".
According to Garcia, the goal was to show the strength of the punch and then box.
Both said they felt the tension between them growing.
“It’s a fight that needs to be fought.
No other conflict causes so much attention and buzz.
I’m more than willing to work for it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: “I’ve been waiting for the best fighters and Mikey is just that.
It will be a good fight.”
From which parts of the world do you move?
Last year, the Police and Border Guard Board (PPA) extended and issued a record number of over 13,000 residence permits to third-country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia for work, study or family.
For example, last year, it was decided to issue a temporary residence permit to 6,702 aliens, but this number was 4,928 last year.
The authorities cannot say how many immigrants will eventually stay permanently in Estonia, but such an analysis is being prepared by the Ministry of the Interior.
While nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year a decade ago, in recent years the number is approaching 2000.
The number of applicants for a residence permit increased dramatically during the crisis in Ukraine – in 2014, 1,087 people received a temporary residence permit, compared to 675 the year before.
According to Statistics Estonia, the number of Ukrainian citizens is growing the most in Estonia – last year, 850 more Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia than left.
"The Ukrainian community has always been large in Estonia, and because of the complicated circumstances in the country, it is natural that people look for work and opportunities to study in a country where the community and many families are already ahead of them," Kristin Rammus, a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior, said.
Last year and last year, the number of Ukrainians who have been granted temporary residence permits was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, although in ten years the number of temporary residence permits issued to the latter has been the highest.
While Ukrainians mostly come here to work, Russian citizens do so for the sake of family migration.
"Given the historical Russian community here, they are more likely to have the largest family connections with people living in Russia," said Helina Maasing, a migration researcher at the Estonian Academy of Security Sciences.
“If you look at where Russian citizens who have been granted Estonian residence permits have moved to, then Ida-Viru County is immediately after Harju County,” he added, pointing out that about 40 per cent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Last year, 1,696 Russian citizens received a temporary residence permit, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wanted to renew their residence permit decreased.
"The reason for the hype is that a new residence permit for settling permanently in Estonia has been applied for instead of the extension of the residence permit," Rammus, a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior, said.
Foreigners who have lived here for at least three years can apply for a new residence permit for settling permanently in Estonia from the previous year.
Its purpose is to encourage people who have adapted to stay here.
A residence permit for long-term residents, for example, requires five years.
Due to the new residence permit, the extension of the old residence permit has probably also decreased.
For example, last year, 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years were granted such a residence permit.
Now the Ukrainians can change jobs and the Estonian state will no longer keep its finger on whether the salary criterion is met.
This residence permit became popular – last year the applicants were the holders of grey passports (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
A total of 1968 people received a residence permit for settling in Estonia, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In ten years, Nigeria has surprisingly become one of the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
In 2007, three residence permits were issued to Nigerians, compared to 200 last year.
Students come from Nigeria to study at universities.
Estonian institutions of higher education are also popular among Georgians, Chinese and Turks, for example.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased mainly due to educational migration.
For them, too, the rule is that where a community has emerged in advance, it will be easier for others to come along,” Rammus added.
In the past ten years, two people have moved to Estonia from North Korea, as much from Laos and Madagascar, for example.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If about 6,000 third-country nationals receive a residence permit each year, that is about 0.46% of the total population.
Even if we count the citizens of the European Union, the migration remains around one percent," Maasing said.
According to Statistics Estonia, a total of 14,822 people immigrated to Estonia last year, while 13,792 emigrated from Estonia.
This means that immigration exceeded emigration for the second year.
Most of the emigrants and immigrants are Estonian citizens, but more of them are among the emigrants.
As a result, the net migration of Estonian citizens was down by 2,000 people last year.
Estonians mainly travel between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture's princess fashion charms with satins, embroidery and tulle
However, for Maria Tammeoru, a vast collection of ideas is history - old paintings and costumes: "I can spend hours dreaming somewhere in a museum and admiring old-fashioned sleeves and collars.
When you do something with passion, you study and learn more about it every day.
This is the joy of discovery!
Mammu Couture’s glamorous world may seem unreal to some, but the designer doesn’t think so.
You decide how much light you have in your life.
I have a friend who has a whole sauna full of my haute couture dresses.
Because it’s not her fault that she doesn’t live in Hollywood and wear the red carpet every day, she wants to wear the most beautiful dresses and she does!
You can make your own life special.
The fashion designer does not recognize the gap between bright events and gray everyday life.
It was this line of thought that set in motion a plan to bring high fashion in Estonia to rural areas, between forests and fields, to people who fashion often does not reach.
The collection of Mammu was presented in V<0xC3><0xB5>ru, J<0xC3><0xB5>hvi and Pärnu fashion fair, where 45 models filled the whole street.
In Tallinn, they often take a pose, nod with dignity, but elsewhere there are more emotions - bravo cries, stand up, want to thank you by the hand.
A large part of the audience came to see, but now they are fans of Mammu Couture.
When you exceed people’s expectations, they’re thrilled!
And I like the feeling that I’m on a summer tour with my fashion design.
In Pärnu we had a 50 metre long red carpet, the whole street was full of beautiful dresses, they seemed to never come to an end!
Maria also does not admit the fashionable fact that the creation must be presented by a supersale supermodel, she is happy to bring ordinary women to the stage.
I often invite my own clients to the stage - they are always happy to come.
It's such a great experience, you can shine on stage in a beautiful dress!
I’m so sorry that I’ve never seen my own performance, I’m always backstage to give things a final touch as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerves wouldn't let me just sit there and watch.
Maria is the kind of fashion designer who doesn’t just want to play a representative role, but wants to be inside everything by the hand.
I have my own sewing machine in the studio, I make most of the collection myself.
I like the whole process where you play with the details, you discover.
I'm never far from my creation and I'm not afraid of work.
The design is not limited to stylistics, logistics, organization, organization - everything must fit into the day of one temperamental woman.
These hours are huge for fanatics.
I don’t know when my work day will end, it’s just a day full of fun for me!
I'm still very lucky - it's like an endless chain of happiness: I do something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful and in turn gets compliments.
It has been said many times that there is magic in my dresses - they make me feel like a princess.
The rich tulle satires that made Maria’s talent famous overnight have remained the signature of Mammu Couture to this day.
Martin M<0xC3><0xBC><0xC3><0xBC>rsepp about the U18 boys: the weapon of the Estonian group stage was turned against us now
Sorry, we're out of fairy tales.
The first thing we noticed was that we couldn't get our table.
And when there’s such a big difference in the table, there’s nothing to do,” commented Martin M<0xC3><0xBC><0xC3><0xBC>rsepp on the 61:75 defeat of the Estonian U18 basketball boys to the United Kingdom.
Opponents took 28 balls from the attacking board and received so many more attacks as a result.
We were also not prepared for their aggressive defense or attack, it hit .
Many of the English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we were unable to build up defenses.
But they could hold hands everywhere in defense, we couldn't combine.
It knocked the crew off their feet.
Homework was better done.
According to M<0xC3><0xBC><0xC3><0xBC>rsepp, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to slow down the pace of its opponents.
In the last quarter - we had zero mistakes, but the opponents already received several quick baskets.
The athleticism and intense insistence that was our weapon in the group stage turned everyone against us.
Today we had no power against their aggression.
The mason was pleased with Matthias Tass, his ward in the Kalev.
In general, good words can be said about the whole team in the tournament, until today there was a unified batting fist.
It's a shame they hadn't met such an aggressive opponent before.
The cup has always been self-confident and played out on its own even today, but it seemed that he was tired – he has been carrying quite a load.
But he made some pretty nice moves that I’ve seen before in training,” added the instructor.
Terrible numbers: the girls’ basketball team scored less than 10 points in the European Championship by three quarters...
In the U18 age group, not only the men’s European Championship B-division basketball tournament goes to Tallinn, the girls started in Dublin the day before yesterday.
And Estonia’s game with Poland unfortunately tended to be in the area of anti-records.
Estonia lost 25:65, but still after the third quarter the score was 9:49, i.e. only in the last ten minutes the opponents took their foot off the gas pedal and that period ended in a draw at 16:16.
In both the first and the second quarter, Estonia scored 4, in the third...
At the same time, the Estonian women first hit two of the first four shots in two minutes, then missed 25 shots, then one in three, and then another 21 shots...
Within half an hour, one of the 47 shots had been taken.
There were also two free throws.
There were a reasonable number of ball hits at that time, 12.
By the end of the game, Poland had 33 per cent and Estonia 13 per cent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two losses, on the opening day it had to admit Portugal’s 83:56 advantage.
NATO ships arrive in Tallinn to replenish supplies
Today, NATO’s 1st Permanent Mine Countermeasures Group arrived in Tallinn for a planned port visit over the weekend to replenish ships’ supplies and prepare for the upcoming exercises.
During the visit, the ships make preparations for returning to the sea and give the crew members the opportunity to rest for a couple of days.
After the visit, NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters to carry out a number of exercises and to be ready for future operations in the search for historical explosives.
"The participation of Estonians in the NATO unit and the co-operative training conducted by them in local waters is a good illustration of our integration with the Allied forces," said Commander Arto Reinmaa, the Commander of the Operations and Planning Department in charge of the Navy Fleet.
As of 29 June, the 1st NATO Permanent Mine Countermeasures Group is led by Latvian Navy Lieutenant General Gvido Laudups, who took over the duties of a group commander from an Estonian naval officer, Lieutenant Johan-Elias from Seljamaa, at a ceremony in Riga.
The flagship of the group is the Latvian Navy support vessel LVNS Virsaitis, on which the group’s command staff also operates.
This semester, the international unit also includes the mine hunter Sakala of the Estonian Navy.
One of the four groups of vessels under NATO’s naval command, the NATO’s 1st Permanent Mine Action Group is a first-line rapid response force that the Alliance can deploy to different parts of the world over a period of five days.
From 4 to 13 August, the ancient ruins of Pirita Monastery will once again become the place where the Birgitta Festival, initiated 13 years ago by Maestro Eri Klas, will be held.
According to Risto Joost (36), artistic director of the Tallinn Philharmonic, this year’s Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
Risto Joost: The opera world classics "Traviata" and "Tosca" will reach the audience, ballet productions from the enchanting "Bolero" to the fun "Karlsson" and there is also a self-production of the program, which this time is the staging of the wonderful oratorio "Seasons" by Joseph Haydn, by the same international creative team that brought Piri to the stage in 2015.
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre productions.
It is bigger than any musical theater in its usual form.
It’s a festival that’s enchanted and never lets go.
For the experience the listener receives in this sublime and mysterious environment makes human souls ring and touches human senses in ways that cannot be described.
Risto, you are the artistic director of Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't Maestro Eri Klas' shoes seem a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klas, it has been very helpful.
He guided me through my entire student career and also supported me in the beginning of my conducting career.
Maybe that's why it's easier for me to continue his work.
Eri Klas has injected so much goodness into the Birgitta Festival team and of course all this is transferred to me as well.
It was great to be part of a team that knows exactly how things work.
It was the big heart of Eri Klas that gave me the strength to move forward with the Birgitta Festival at the Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am, and I can do it!
What could excite the audience at this year’s festival, what do you offer?
We have artists from England, Latvia and Lithuania, and the first ballet written for Astrid Lindgren’s story will be presented.
It's Karlsson Fly.
And one curious nuance of it is that the composer of this ballet is Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed the desire to write this work.
She has probably had a Karlsson character living in her soul since childhood.
Risto, how do you manage all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner.
This kind of work needs a support system and a lot of love, and I have a lot of that, thankfully.
And I’ve noticed that my personal emotions don’t depend so much on other people, as much as they do on me, or how I react to each new day.
And this kind of conscious keeping of tone, keeping positive and actually smiling at myself in the mirror in the mornings, significantly increased my luck percentage.
Especially this week, when there are the most important rehearsals, I have been practicing it with great enthusiasm and it works.
Smiling to yourself activates the brain and lifts the tone.
It's not just a word.
I think people don’t know half the things about their bodies that the universe has to offer them, but everyone is slowly discovering it.
Right now, this is the big moment.
Do you have any rituals before you step in the driver's seat?
You have to change your clothes for more comfortable ones.
This is a small moment for yourself.
But in general, yes, I don't get a chance to rest or take a nap before a big show.
In fact, I even like to interact with people actively, even before I step into the conductor’s office.
But come to Birgitta Festival, there is something to discover even for a not so big opera and ballet fan!
Watch the fun video with Risto Joost!
New results of age assessment tests for Swedish asylum seekers published
The latest results show that more than 80 percent of those tested were estimated to be older than 18, but not all believe in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing earlier this year.
The tests were created to provide a more accurate age assessment during the asylum application process after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of a number of refugees who allegedly were minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing and the Forensic Institute has issued a total of 2,481 test results between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were rated as 18 years or older, and an additional 25 cases were rated by the Forensic Institute that the test subject “could be 18 years or older.”
In 432 cases, it was concluded that a person is "probably younger than 18".
Tests are only used when a person’s age is in question.
According to Johan G<0xC3><0xB6>ransson, who works at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, the results are consistent compared to previous months.
"We don't see much of a difference compared to the statistics from previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local newspaper.
The fact that the majority of cases were estimated to be older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The institute issued the results of 581 tests in May, and said in 442 cases, “there are indications that the person being tested is 18 years of age or older.”
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet looked at the results of these 581 tests, it turned out that in 243 cases, the person had directly stated that he would be 18 this year.
This medical age estimation method, which involves X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI of knee joints, after which they are allowed to be analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticized in some circles.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institutet, whose job includes assessing people’s biological maturity to find out if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.
“I’ve had reason to think about it and I don’t think the measurement method we’re using now should be used.
Determining the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, then we shouldn't pretend we can," he told Metro.
But Johan G<0xC3><0xB6>ransson of the Institute of Forensic Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of classifying a child inaccurately into an adult is low.
The highest risk, around 10%, is when the person is just under 18."

20-year-old hammer thrower Anna Maria Orel made her beautiful debut at the World Championships in London, getting a good 18th place with 67.37.
The organ was the youngest female hammer player at the World Championships, and a cheerful woman confirmed that she hopes to fight for the medals in the future.
The race went well and I had a good experience.
On the first attempt (64.80) I immediately made my average result, on the second (62.80) I took too much risk and on the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear," said Orel after the race.
I was looking for my e-mail and I am very glad I found it.
Anna Maria Orel’s World Championships debut ended with a good 18th place.
The rain did not disturb Orel, because he trains through the winter at the TUT stadium.
"I'm hardened," he said with a small smile.
There was almost a full house of people at the London Olympic Stadium, did the Organ sense the people around it, or was it able to shut itself off?
I did, but in a positive way.
Everyone says it adds up - that's it!
When you compete, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that he will be satisfied with the debut of the World Championships and that there are many good competitions ahead of him: "I came here with the 32nd or last result of this season, I finished in 18th place.
This is a very decent result.
I’m 20 years old and I’m in the MM – that’s all that matters.
I take a good experience with me and some days I want to compete already for the medals.
West Virginia Governor Announces Change of Party
West Virginia Democrat Governor Jim Justice announced at a gathering with President Trump on Thursday evening that he would change party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats walked out on me," Justice said.
“Today I say to you, after much prayer and reflection...Today I say to you, the people of West Virginia, that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor.”
The gathering was filled with joy.
“So I’m going to be a Republican tomorrow,” Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time to play a different game."
Trump had previously promised a big announcement at a gathering in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the state according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes says he owns coal mines in five states and inherited the coal business from his father.
Its value is approximately $1.59 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee (RNC) released a statement on Thursday evening stating that “Governor Justice’s party change is another blow to the Democratic Party that would rather prevent the country from getting better again than work toward it.”
“With just 15 governorships and control over the lowest number of states in history, Governor Justice’s announcement is simply the most recent denial to a party that is run from end to end and cannot find a positive and unifying message,” Ronna McDaniel, the RNC’s chairwoman, said in a statement to CBS News.
It’s no surprise that there are a lot of people injured.
Urmet, who works in the medical tent during the weekend, told <0xC3><0x95>htuleht yesterday that they had to distribute quite a lot of patches.
Blisters and abrasions are basic, with twists and slight falls.
Head, back and leg pain, of course.
According to Urmet, visitors come to the festival wearing the wrong shoes and this is how problems come.
The doctors have also had to assist a few visitors with major injuries – there have been some panic attacks and also a broken leg.
We have also made stitches when a person has broken a hand or a finger.
We'll do the smaller stitches here, the bigger ones we'll send to the hospital.

Coe offers Russia 'honest apology' for doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, the international figurehead of athletics, praised Russia's "honest apology on Thursday" for the doping scandal, but reiterated that now was not the time to allow the sport back into the country.
Russian athletics leader Dmitry Shylakhtin told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships that the ban on his country's participation in athletics was right and that he had a clear goal to fight doping.
He apologized to "all track and field athletes who have been stripped of their gold and silver medals in competitions".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the competition ban, which was imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
“I think it was a very honest response, a very honest presentation,” IAAF President Coe told reporters.
“The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation itself acknowledged that they have had a rather difficult time and will do everything possible to restructure the Federation,” he said.
Coe said he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its own restoration.
"I believe today was a very constructive day and progress is being made, but Congress supports the working group's proposal that now is not the right time to take back Russia," Coe said.
“We need to do everything we can in the next few months to normalise the situation.
We have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate pure athletes from the corrupted system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian track and field athletes who meet the IAAF’s strict criteria will compete as neutral athletes at the World Championships starting Friday in London.
Rune Andersen, the head of the IAAF task force, said on Monday that Russia does not yet meet a number of criteria for restoration.
He told reporters in London that doping controls were still inadequate and that coaches who had been banned were still operating freely.
The electric car revolution will significantly change the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only will the electric car revolution fundamentally change everything from the fuel market to the infrastructure, it will also create new winners and losers in the metal market.
While mining giants like Glencore can say that from one place they win and from another they lose, smaller mining companies are not helped.
Glencore currently earns from coal and oil, but demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminum and nickel will continue to grow in the era of electric cars.
This year, the expansion of electric vehicles has been boosted by the decisions of the governments of the United Kingdom, France and Norway, which promise to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades.
As a result, Volvo has already announced its plans to phase out the internal combustion engine, and Tesla will launch a cheaper Model 3 electric car.
According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, more electric cars will be sold than cars powered by oil over the next two decades.
"For some metals, it changes everything," Simona Gambranini, a commodity analyst at Capital Economics, told Bloomberg.
We have already seen a great impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, for which demand has been growing for years.
Electric cars have about three times as much copper as conventional cars, Glencore said.
Even more copper is needed at charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribas estimates that it will increase copper demand by about five percent by 2025.
The growth in demand for electric car batteries means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore’s growing electric car trend will benefit from rising copper prices and being the world’s largest producer of cobalt, the Jefferies Group predicted.
The other winners of the electric car race are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already responding to a changing trend.
This year, the London Metal Exchange has seen a 70 percent increase in the price of cobalt.
The price increase last year was 37 percent.
The price of copper has also risen by 14% this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore’s stock rose 20 percent in London, surpassing rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American.
On the losing side are lead companies such as Recyclex and Campine, which have to adapt to the new era.
The main end-uses of lead are batteries that supply current to the starters of petrol and diesel cars.
Electric cars use lithium-ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk to lead demand unless it is found to have another purpose to overcome the drop in demand," said Michael Widmer, head of metal market analysis at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The effect of the unwinding trend in the form of lead price movement has not yet been noticed.
Lead has risen 17 percent this year, making it the best metal among London’s major industrial metals.
Investors will see problems with metal only in the distant future.
"I'm not sure it's that bad for lead, because cheap oil keeps conventional cars in competition," said Herwig Schmidt, sales manager at metal broker Triland Metals.
When the demand for lead falls, it happens slowly.
This may happen in about 10 years.
In the meantime, stricter emission standards mean that demand for hybrid cars will increase, which will depend on lead-based batteries developed in frequent engine launches, the international lead and zinc research organization estimates.
Light metals such as aluminum replace steel, as a lighter car can travel further with less electricity.
This explains the additional demand of 1,6 million tonnes of aluminium between 2013 and 2016.
This accounts for 2.7% of the world’s aluminium production.
This trend is likely to worsen, Widmer said.
The price of aluminium has risen by 13 percent this year, as the growing demand from car manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
Steel producers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding is partnering with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce lightweight car bodies.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter alloy steel to resist aluminum plating.
"High-strength steel should be the answer to this development," said Sylvain Brunet, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas.
We have seen some progress in Europe.
The end of the oil age can also bring suffering to platinum.
Last year, about half of that precious metal was used as catalysts for diesel-powered cars, metal refiner Johnson Matthey said.
“Many raw materials that are in high demand now, such as oil and platinum, may not be in high demand in the future,” said Bernard Dahdah, raw material analyst at Natixis.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important, but their importance will change within 15 years.
Platinum manufacturers believe there will be continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Marc Grynberg, CEO of Uncore, said that there will continue to be more hybrid cars sold than fully electric cars in 2025.
The big hope for platinum manufacturers in the 10 year perspective is the hydrogen cell-based cars developed by Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos, which rely on platinum to produce electricity from hydrogen.
So far, however, this technology has not yet proven itself commercially.
"Diesel seems to be a clear loser on the road to electric cars," said Exane BNP Paribasist Brunet.
German automakers suffered a major setback in July when a court in Stuttgart banned diesel from use in Mercedes-Benz and Porsche’s hometown.
How Football Finance Rules Affect Neymar’s Transition to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unbridled spending by European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from making the world record move from a Spanish football club to a French club Paris-Saint Germain in Barcelona.
Whatever the consequences of UEFA, the governing body that rules the European game and has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament, Paris Saint-Germain is yet to come.
The Fair Play Financial Rules (FFP) put in place by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will have to prove at some point that Neymar’s transfer was funded without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy out the Brazilian from his contract, and Neymar’s salary is starting to reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar’s move to the French club.
PSG will no doubt be able to raise that kind of money to recruit Neymar and add him to its star-studded lineup, given that the team is funded by a Qatari energy-disrupter ruling family.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on recruiting players, but they have to balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to get out on their own in the football business.
The FFP was founded by Michel Platini after he was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that fall into large debts in search of success were in fact engaged in cheating and risked ruin if banks or owners were to give up support.
Since 2011, FFP has focused on monitoring the losses of the clubs instead of their debts.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used in 2003 at Chelsea – buying a club with potential and then making big money to improve the team and build a global brand – will be more difficult to implement.
During the current three-year assessment period, which runs until 2018, FFP clubs may incur losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite Platini’s shameless rejection of the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, remains committed to preventing overspending.
"The FFP is certainly not dead and we will certainly continue to strengthen these rules in the future," Andrea Traverso, who oversees the FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar for the sale-and-lease-back clause in the form of a single payment, it is possible for them to split this amount for accounting purposes throughout the duration of the contract.
Neymar entered into a five-year contract, so it is possible to indicate a transitional fee of EUR 44,4 million per year for the next five years.
In the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, together with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, received the most severe penalties.
PSG was fined €60 million ($82 million at the time), later reduced to €20 million, and was required to restrict the Champions League team to 21 players instead of the usual 25 for the 2014–15 season.
UEFA is looking for clubs that might try to outsmart the regulatory financial institutions by blowing up their incomes through companies affiliated with the club’s owners.
A Qatari company may sponsor PSG, but if the value of the sponsorship is considered to be above standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to count as official income.
This is what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of support from the Qatar Tourism Authority PSG was inflated.
It has been said that some of Neymar’s PSG service may come from Qatar through payments from the 2022 World Cup Organizing Committee.
However, PSG and Qatar in 2022 deny that Neymar could become a World Cup ambassador, and argue that UEFA regulators could easily uncover such a maneuver.
The penalties previously imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant against any attempt to break the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed Neymar's transition with PSG in advance.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition that their anonymity be guaranteed as they were not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG made profits of more than EUR 10 million in the 2015-2016 season, with a turnover of around EUR 542.4 million.
Data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes Neymar’s arrival will have a positive impact on sponsorship deals, merchandising and shirt sales.
The club expects an increase of at least 30 percent in turnover due to the signing of the contract.
The Spanish league, clearly upset by the departure of one of the biggest football stars, tried to block Neymar’s move by claiming that PSG was violating FFP.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the country," La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to PSG's ownership of Qatar.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by the American sports magnate, shares La Liga’s view that the club is financed by the state.
"This is a consequence of property rights and has completely changed the whole football landscape over the past 15 years," Wenger said.
“If the club belongs to the state, anything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play, because a country may have other ways or other interests for such a big player to represent the country.”
Norwegian, the Norwegian low-cost airline, has a nice tradition of putting pictures of those who have pushed the boundaries in their fields and have been an inspiration to others.
With the expansion of Norwegian’s operational geography, the circle of people who have earned a place on the wedge has also expanded.
Selected personalities include Benjamin Franklin, Greta Garbo (pictured), and Miguel de Cervantes.
In the near future, however, a portrait of Queen’s legendary singer Freddie Mercury will decorate one of the planes.
Today 50 years ago: a hurricane-sized storm in Estonia that tore the roofs and windows from the houses.
A hurricane called the Storm of the Century, which raged on 6 and 7 August, caused great damage to Lääne County, Harju County and Rapla County in particular.
During these days the wind speed in north-western Estonia was over 30 m/s.
My old man ran from one curved tree in the garden to another and tried to support them with his hands.
Everything was dark and ragged, like the end of the world.
Roofs were already flying from the houses, old lady Linda Kurova from Haapsalu recalled in an interview given to Eesti Loodus magazine in 2002.
Linda’s husband saw the garden he planted collapse.
What do you do with your hands when you’re facing a storm like this?
The sea came under the window, water splashed in through the windows," said Mrs Linda, who lived on Kalda Street in Haapsalu at the time.
That the roads were full of trees and the roof of the railway station platform had flown from 20 to 30 metres away, Linda, like most of the Haapsalus, could not see until the next morning.
According to locals, the trees behind Paralepa were at a low level, some completely lying down, some half down.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm passed through the beautiful old trees with ragged and crackling like a war.
Lääne-Viru County did not suffer particularly badly in the August storm of 1967 compared to West Estonia, but the damage was also significant there, Virumaa Teataja wrote in 2007.
Haapsalu Castle Park and Padise Park were wiped off the face of the earth, but the parks around us were also severely damaged.
Wind speeds in Tallinn were measured at up to 35 metres per second, i.e. about 130 kilometres per hour.
On the evening of the 6th of August, a little girl in Merivälja, Tallinn, had shouted: "Mom, Mom!
The chickens are in the air and can't get down anymore!" wrote Virumaa Teataja.
The P<0xC3><0xB5>lli manor building in Viljandi County was so destroyed during the storm that it was decided to demolish it later.
The constructions of the T<0xC3><0xBC>ri ski jumping hill, which was later not restored, could not withstand the August storm.
The newspaper Red Star reported on August 12, 1967, that the removal of cities and settlements from fallen trees and their branches is progressing slowly, and residents could participate in the clean-up work.
The storm also severely damaged the crop fields, and the newspaper stated that "parties' primary organizations must be an inspiration and a guide both in the refurbishment work and in the harvest."
Hurricanes occur when the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The record for gusts of wind in Estonia is set on 2 November 1969, when the wind speed in Ruhnu was measured at 48 m/s.
The gauge on Vaindloo Island was broken, so the measured strong wind speed could not be accurately recorded.
The secret of clean beaches: night cleaning and poor beach weather
Colder summer weather also means a smaller cleaning effort on the beaches of Tallinn.
“When there is no weather, there are people on the beach, and when there is no weather, there are no people.”
Seagulls are howling on Stroomi Beach in northern Tallinn.
For them, the melodic competition comes from a low-speed rattling tractor that plows stripes onto the patch.
In fact, the latter sifts through the sand at a depth of three inches [7 cm], picking up marine debris and human debris —bottle caps, cigarette butts, and so forth.
People still come to the beach, whether the water is warm or not.
When the weather is nice, there are people on the beach, and when there are no people, there are also no people," says Aleksandr Usov, head of beach cleaning at the Haabersti Haldus private limited company.
It’s 6:30 a.m. and there’s a hard cleaning going on on the beach, because at 8 p.m. the square has to be clean for people.
Usov's on duty at 4:00.
In addition to Stroomi, he also keeps an eye on Pirita, Lake Harku, Kakumäe and Paljasaare Pikakari beaches.
The amount of rubbish has decreased.
Years ago there was so much more.
People can now appreciate what is being done for them,” says Usov, who has been cleaning the beach for 15 years.
Before, when something new was put up, it was already broken the next day.
Now they're keeping what's on the beach.
The price of a clean beach
One of the biggest jobs on Estonian beaches is cleaning up the sea litter washed up on the shore.
For example, in Pirita beach, 400,000 tons of it has to be transported to the beach season.
"It's an incredible amount," Usov notes.
The second big category is household waste, that is, everything that people leave behind.
The one-and-a-half-mile stretch of Stroomi Beach has eight large garbage cans that need to be emptied three times a week.
There is so much rubbish.
However, the colder summer weather has meant that litter is one fifth less than otherwise.
The third category is abandoned property.
They're mostly children's toys.
This time Usov has scooped out a dozen model cars from the sand.
They are waiting for the owners on the wooden road to the beach.
Usov already knows that he will soon find them again in the sand.
Children come to the beach and take toys to drown them in the sand again.
Garbage to be scattered
Erika Scholler, the representative of Haaberst’s administrative services, admits that the screening work of the tractor is disrupted by locals.
Noise, which lasts from the hours of the night to the early morning, disturbs the sleep of people living in the neighbourhood.
This work is impossible during the day.
In one month, the beach has to be sifted twice.
“If we don’t, the district will fine us,” Scholler notes.
However, like Pirita, Pikakari and Pärnu, the goal is to get Stroomi beach under the international blue flag quality mark.
“Compared to Europe, there is much more work to be done in Estonia to maintain beaches,” says Scholler.
We have more seaweed and rocks, and it's harder to sift the sand.
There is less rubbish on our beaches than anywhere else in Europe.
When Martin, who lives near Stroomi Beach, hears about the rubbish on the beach, he enters the conversation circle of a journalist and cleaning staff, highlighting the current problems on the beach.
There's a disgusting picture everywhere in the morning.
The problem is with the birds and the bottle pickers who have pulled the garbage bags inside out,” Martin says.
Although it is difficult to assume that people will be able to change their current behavioural habits, Martin hopes that the city government will do something about the rubbish bins and put lids on them, for example, to prevent at least birds from visiting them.
In general, however, Martin is pleased with the development of Stroomi beach.
You can see the city is taking care of that.
With children's playgrounds, illuminated and freshly paved roads, it has become more pleasant.
Once upon a time, roller skates could only ride on one road,” notes Martin.
Treasure hunter's finds in Stroomi: coins, coins only
A 40-year-old Dimitri, who is scouring the beach with a metal detector as a treasure hunter, has taken advantage of the low tide period of the morning.
He does not believe that he will find anything valuable today or in the future.
The sea gods are not generous enough.
“I’ve been working on this for a year and haven’t found anything of value yet,” Dmitri says.
As a hobby treasure hunter, Dmitri’s treasure bag contains some euro coins, bottle caps and also dangerous nails, which later throws them in the trash.
There are usually coins.
"Gold, rings and the like usually don't exist," says the treasure hunter.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain at the same level, as weak economic growth and easing inflation have softened speculation about the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish as tight household incomes have put interest rates on hold.
Policymakers at the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to keep the 6:2 rate at 0.25%, with fewer members calling for an increase this month as slow economic growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank cut its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that pressure on household incomes will continue as inflation is still expected to rise to close to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the bank also signaled that the growth of the rates will be necessary in the next few years to contain the inflation caused by Brexit and that higher than expected loan costs may be necessary in the financial markets.
Members also voted to partially withdraw the mammoth package that was launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
The bank will end a time-limited funding scheme in February that will provide banks with cheap funding, although it said it now expects a <0xC2><0xA3>15bn increase in supply under the scheme, amounting to <0xC2><0xA3>115bn.
In the minutes of the decision on the rate, the bank says: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) will remain powerless in the near future, as the difficult situation of real household incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption."
In terms of rates, it was reiterated that a "some tightening of monetary policy" is needed to ease inflation, to a "slightly greater extent" than is expected in the markets.
The stock exchange is currently forecasting a first rise in the third quarter of next year and a second rise in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any jumps are gradual and limited.
The bank’s reduced growth forecasts for this year and next year are comparable to those of May, 1.9% and 1.7%, respectively.
The forecast for growth of 1.8 per cent in 2018 remained unchanged.
After this news, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to USD 1.31 and 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision not to make any changes is due to recent disappointing growth figures, which have dampened growing expectations due to an increase in GDP in the second quarter, from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.
The bank says the growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will pick up slightly by the end of the year.
The bank’s latest inflation report gave households suffering from rising inflation and miserable wage increases little reason to rejoice, saying that the situation will get a little worse before it improves.
It was added that monetary policy cannot prevent income shocks in the next few years, but towards the end of the three-year forecast, wages are expected to recover significantly.
Due to the weak pound, the economy is also stimulated by the growing demand for British production, which partially offsets lower costs for consumers.
The decision comes a year after the rates were moved to 0.25% last August after a shocking EU referendum that caused the pound to suddenly weaken.
According to the bank, it will probably take four years to fully breathe life into prices and the economy.
Before the bank’s last decision, there was a growing demand for the rate to be raised, as inflation had increased pressure on distressed households; in July, three policymakers called for the rate to be raised to 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, compared to 2.9% in June, although the bank said it was expected to rise again in the coming months.
The bank said the excess growth over the 2 percent target was due to a completely weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Head of Mortgage Brokers at Coreco, said: “In light of the recent decline in exchange rates, it seems the mortgage market is once again becoming increasingly competitive as lenders crave work and hope to finish the year in a positive way.
The stock exchange seems particularly favorable to those whose valid trades are nearing completion, as refinancing, often free of charge and at a low rate, has become increasingly popular.”
The NHS is preparing to prescribe a controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people.
Patients will have access to “transformative” HIV-preventive treatment from September after a battle in the Supreme Court over whether the drug should be funded by the NHS.
NHS England announced that National Health Service will now make available to an estimated 10,000 people a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) tablet during the initial three-year clinical trial, which has shown an approximate 86% reduction in the risk of infection in people at high risk.
The NHS agreed to fund the clinical trial after the Court of Appeal upheld last year's Supreme Court ruling that the NHS was able to pay for PrEP, despite the agency's own claims that the drug should be funded by local authorities.
NHS England CEO Simon Stevens hailed the move as a "new large-scale intervention", while the National AIDS Fund (NAT) described it as a "revolutionary moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to start enrolling people. In October, more clinics will be added before the program is deployed everywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of contracting HIV.
Clinical trial results show that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that there is a sufficient amount of certain drugs in the human body that prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day, or no later than two hours before intercourse.
Candidates for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people, and people whose partners are infected with HIV and are not receiving treatment.
Clinics will identify eligible people who are willing to participate in a clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people, and those whose HIV-infected partner is not receiving antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a GP there can also register their wish to participate at a local sexual health clinic participating in the programme.
The programme will cost <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and NHS England signed a contract to receive the medicines this week following an international procurement procedure.
The aim of the clinical trial is to assess the true potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on who the drug is intended for and how it is consumed and applied in the big picture.
Stevens said: "This new large-scale intervention should complement and amplify the comprehensive and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV.
“This is another milestone in more than three decades of fighting one of humanity’s greatest health challenges.”
Deborah Gold, executive director of the NAT, said: “This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if properly targeted to those who need it and are at risk, offers an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people at high risk of HIV in England will have access to a powerful new tool, individually manageable and independent of negotiations with a partner, through this NHS-funded clinical trial, thereby improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “It is now a priority to make sure that the clinical trial across the country gets underway quickly and that no one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial drug has been procured, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of contracting HIV.
Sharon Hodgson, the shadow minister for public health, said: “The start of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and long overdue after months of delays and dragging the government’s feet.
The evidence shows the magnitude of the changes that this medicine can bring to the prevention of HIV and the cessation of the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical trial takes us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical trial is rolled out as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are exposed to HIV and bring us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society."
The price of electricity increased by 12% in Estonia, while it fell in Latvia and Lithuania.
In July, the difference in the exchange price of electricity for the next day between the price areas of Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania decreased to 1.94 euros, compared to 7.71 euros in June this year, Elering said.
The main reason for the price difference is the breakdown of the Lithuanian-Swedish connection.
The average exchange price of electricity in Estonia last month was 34.33 euros per megawatt-hour, and the price increased by 12% compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five percent to 36.27 euros per megawatt-hour.
In Finland, the price was 34.17 euros and the system price of the Nord Pool power exchange was 26.37 euros per megawatt-hour.
Prices increased by 12% and 7%, respectively.
Electricity flowed between Estonia and Finland for 75 per cent of the previous month’s hours in the direction of Estonia and for 16 per cent of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
For the remaining 9% of the hours, there were no next day’s transactions between the two countries.
Electricity moved between Estonia and Latvia 99 per cent of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73 per cent of the hours had all the transmission capacity in use.
According to the transactions that took place on the last trading day of July on the Nasdaq OMX market, the exchange price of electricity could be approximately 34 euros per megawatt-hour in August and 37 euros per megawatt-hour in September.
The price of carbon dioxide, which affects the production price of electricity, rose last month and transactions took place at the price of 5.04-5.47 euros per ton.
Living high up - a half-floor and clever design tips have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker and passionate real estate innovator, swapped her large Knightsbridge home for an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of the Queen Anne Terrace, and the fact that Joanne has not packed her bags and resold the apartment is a tribute to the new design.
"Before that, I lived with my ex-partner in Knightsbridge on a much larger surface," Joanne said.
“I was looking for something that would be equivalent to the price I was offering.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day.”
Since its first visit, this 93-square-meter apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
At first, it was an apartment with a single bedroom and a complex layout - to get to the bedroom, you had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add storage space and a half-floor to take advantage of the high ceilings.
“I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands,” he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi from Duck & Shed, an architectural and design studio based in Notting Hill, to take advantage of the 3.8 m high ceilings and create a home that would not just be a development, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two rooms on top of each other, so it was an architectural challenge to create a half-story where one could stand upright.
Erfan had to approach the matter creatively.
"The metal construction is quite complex," he explains.
“We had to rearrange the rooms so that they would sit on top of each other without having to bow down.
It wasn’t just about building a platform, we used a steel structure to make sure the height of both the upper and lower room was right.”
This arrangement allowed Erfan to create two full-height rooms one above the other, with plenty of dramatic elements.
From the half-floor you can see the glamorous living room below from the old-fashioned Retrouvius window with copper light.
Mirrored golden furniture, silver details and retro-scented Serge Mouille light accentuate the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatricality, spaciousness and lightness.
Mirrors are added at both ends of the short corridor to make it feel longer.
In the kitchen, the rear wall with a mirror gives the impression of a window opening into another room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet provides storage space for all of Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
The possibility of closing the kitchen part when not in use adds a charm to the living room, creating an image of a more glamorous space.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
What is unique about this kitchen, however, is the fact that it is a garage-type retractable door.
“There was a bit of a design problem,” Erfan explains the steel-reinforced veneered MDF door.
"It has a counterweight, which is why it glides very easily when pushed up."
Thanks to smart use of space and storage space, Joanne now has 16 extra square meters, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
“After all, the floor space is what you sell — or what gives the property value,” says Erfan.
"A real estate agent enters a room in an outdated form and makes calculations based on the floor area."
Here they have been able to increase the floor space, using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
“Materials are what you touch, and they help create an emotional bond with your home,” says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with an electrical cable in the wall.
It’s important, but it doesn’t make the heart speak.”
This shows that a good design and an increased area will help to make a rather ordinary apartment something amazing.
In fact, they may even create a desire not to leave, as happened with Joanne.
The main character, Dane Jensen, is a bounty hunter in a Chicago skyscraper competing with a colleague for a promotion.
All that matters is the amount of money you earn, and you forget all about ethics.
He only sees his wife and three children early in the morning and late at night.
In the first half of the film, I catch myself thinking that this is the business version of House of Cards – even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler’s speech style is similar.
However, as the film progresses, the frame-like element becomes less and less, and the moralising intent of the filmmakers becomes more and more apparent.
A life-changing experience for the main character is his son getting cancer.
Now we have to make a choice between work and family life.
Aspiring to become an architect, his son makes his father walk to the big buildings in Chicago and think about the things that really matter: faith, goodness, love... not even the disaster of the Twin Towers.
After the third scene where the son opens his father’s eyes, the filmmakers feel that the goal is to make the audience cry, because even the most bitter-hearted viewer cannot hold back the tears from seeing the suffering of the beloved boy with cancer.
When his son falls into a coma and his situation seems almost hopeless, the father finally realizes the immorality of his work and does a good deed for the old man who is looking for a job.
Now I bet myself that if the film has a happy ending, I will reward my perceptiveness with coffee after the film, but if I’m wrong, I can praise the writer for at least one surprise.
For a moment, I suspect I'm missing a cup of coffee when my husband calls Dane from the hospital and he slowly rushes down the hall to his room.
The son, on the other hand, has miraculously recovered, and even though his father has just lost his job, it turns out to be a positive thing, because now is the time to deal with the family.
I can feel myself well - I can already predict the end of the American drama quite well!
To be honest, the film is well-constructed, all the necessary elements are there.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and the morals are beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I think this movie will make a good comeback.
Trump’s new chief of staff plans to curb the president’s media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it for real.
In that case, he would be the first.
The White House’s new chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information, including news, to President Trump, in the hope that it will keep the chief of staff in the calmer waters.
Here's a snippet from reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, met with senior officials on his first day at the White House, he pointed out a key problem in President Donald Trump’s White House that he was planning to solve by getting bad information into the president’s hands.
Kelly told officials that information must flow through him, either on paper or at meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he was given good information.”
Kelly’s diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have also tried and have failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media consumption.
President Trump’s relationship with television goes back decades, and even now that he’s in the White House, his TV viewing habits haven’t gone away.
“When candidate Trump was upset by the dishonest media coverage, it was worth showing him that he was also fairly featured in influential publications,” former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that “according to six former campaign workers, the key to controlling Trump’s Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption also includes a steady stream of praise.”
Okay, okay, okay.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter use habits have once been “under control” is ludicrous.
Maybe these campaign workers know something the rest of us don’t know, that Trump’s tweets would have been even more inflammatory without these interventions.
We’ll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn’t post.
If his assistants could save him from trouble even a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from consistently creating controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House of competing cliques, people are exclusively trying to promote their own interests by providing Trump with material that supports their worldviews, but may not always be reliable.
In May, Politico wrote about the advisers’ tendency to feed the president information of strategically questionable value.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
“Current and former Trump subordinates say Trump may react to negative press, particularly damaging information leaks, explosively, obsessed with identifying their source.
That’s what happened at the end of February, when someone gave the president a gleefully printed copy of an article on the GotNews.com website owned by internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being a “multiple leaker” at the White House.
It doesn’t matter that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter for taunting, or that he didn’t provide any concrete evidence, or that he’s made and withdrawn false accusations in the past.
"Trump read the article and started asking his subordinates about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Chief of Staff Rob Porter “have attempted to establish a system for managing and documenting documents that reach Trump.”
How'd you do that?
Three months later, Kelly is trying to do exactly the same thing.
He may prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians who have come to the capital from abroad do not hesitate to get permission to perform.
There are a lot of foreigners playing in Tallinn city centre.
Those with whom <0xC3><0x95>htuleht spoke admitted that they play in the Old Town without the permission of the city government.
We were the first to find three street musicians near the Viru gates, who had brought along the same number of dogs with them.
It was clear that musicians with dreadlocks and torn clothes were backpackers who could use a shower.
Despite her appearance, the only woman in the group played a fun rhythmic song on the accordion, while a man juggled with three balls next to her and invited passers-by to come closer.
The third man had sat next to them on a backpack and smoked a ready-made pot in peace of heart.
The three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the passing crowd.
Bob, who played the accordion with Noem and jugglers with the balls, said that they make music on the streets for both fun and money.
The purpose of the company’s presentation was to collect ticket money for a ship sailing to Finland in the evening of the same day.
When asked if they had asked the city for permission to play music in the old town, Noem and Bob shook their heads.
First of all, we didn't know.
Second, we never stay in the same city for more than a day or two, and most of the time they give us permission for a month or so.
“There’s no point in paying for it,” Bob said.
When we came back to the gates of Viru about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were with the musicians and were driving them away.
The company moved with backpacks and dogs to the intersection of Viru Keskus to try their luck.
Three young men from Poland also performed on Viru Street, one of whom played the violin, the other played the clarinet and the third even brought an electronic piano.
“We’re here to entertain people, to spread music and joy, and to make money for fuel and living,” Mivosh said.
According to Mivosh, they are aware of the fact that permission from the city government is required for the performance.
"Of course we don't have it," he said jokingly.
But we hope that when people enjoy our music, there will be no problem.
Of course, if the police come, we’ll go elsewhere, but we have to try,” he added.
Eesti Pank bought 149 million euros worth of bonds as part of the public sector asset purchase programme of the central banks of the euro area in July, while the central bank’s bond portfolio grew to 4.36 billion euros.
The central bank does not publish detailed information on purchases.
President of the Bank of Estonia Hardo Hansson has previously explained in reply to an interpellation of members of the Riigikogu that the asset purchase programme of the central banks of the Eurosystem includes three different purchase programmes: financial sector covered bonds (covered bonds), asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank buys bonds from the market in order to encourage investors who have sold bonds to invest money elsewhere.
Purchases have the effect of reducing the return on lower-risk assets and of motivating investors to take greater risks.
As a rule, within the framework of the public sector bond purchase programme, each central bank buys its own government bonds, while the bonds of other countries are not purchased.
As the Estonian state has not issued any bonds, Eesti Pank makes so-called replacement purchases within the limits of the volume allocated to them.
Substitution purchases are also made by central banks in those countries where the offer of bonds complying with the purchase programme is limited.
According to Hansson, Eesti Pank generally buys bonds from European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Investment Bank.
Eesti Pank has been buying bonds under the asset purchase programme since March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering bonds were purchased, but Eesti Pank will no longer buy Elering bonds as of June 2016.
Starting from June, the Bank of Finland will buy Elering and Eesti Energia bonds on behalf of the central banks of the euro area.
Travelers Ignore Trench and Return to “Millionaire District”
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands have once again come into fierce conflict with determined travelers who have ignored a trench dug by the council to win back a field away from their villas.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans in a field near Solihull Street, a wealthy “millionaire’s district.”
They have returned with an army of horses, children and trucks since they were kicked out in May, not to be disturbed by the trench dug by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical team found a weak spot at the perimeter, squeezing their vehicles through an unblocked section that had been left in the footpath.
Enraged residents have cursed Solihull’s council, saying the council is “useless in dealing with the problem.”
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there Monday night after being pushed out of Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passersby.
The council needs to be shamed into taking action because they are useless in tackling the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were chased away, and now they're back again.
"They came in last night, probably more today."
He added: “Birmingham Council knows how to deal with these issues by getting long-held seals to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I’m not happy that I have to keep paying council tax when the council can’t even stop such a thing.”
One local resident, who also wished to remain anonymous, said: "This is ridiculous. We have just seen the last of these travellers leave, and there is already another offensive going on.
This time the number has increased, and the grassland has even seen a horse rummaging."
A representative of the Solihull council said: "We are aware that there is an illegal campground on the land near Streetsbrook Road, and we are cooperating with the Solihull police. We are taking the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible.
It is very helpful to gather evidence when as many local people as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This will help create a picture of the situation for the court when we present the case to them."
The weekend festival will be visited by Minister of Culture Indrek Saar, among others, who is glad that the real world’s top names have been brought to Estonia.
When asked why the Weekend Festival is so important to Estonians, Saar answers that it should be asked of all those who enjoy the festival to the full for three days.
However, he admits that the real players in his field have come to Pärnu.
"Looking at the level of artists that have been able to be brought to Estonia, the absolute top names of this music genre are brought home - this often does not happen in our area," the Minister of Culture says.
Which artists perform at the festival speak for themselves the most?
I consider myself a relatively old person and for older people like me, Armin van Buuren, who stepped up last night, is definitely one of the most experienced artists.
According to his record, all of us have spun our feet at some point,” he says.
There are many other names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our own Estonian makers too: starting with NO<0xC3><0x8B>P and you can read a whole series of them.
In reality, this concentration of well-known names is very high," he says.
Take a closer look at the video!
Audi to upgrade up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in the midst of criticism
A day before the announcement, BMW announced that it would offer software upgrades to more than 350,000 vehicles.
According to the BMW chairman, the company believes that “there are smarter options than driving restrictions”, referring to European cities, including BMW’s hometown of Munich, which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will upgrade three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce emissions from diesel engines.
None of the companies described these actions as a recall.
European car manufacturers have been keen to promote the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitric oxide emitted by diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of equipment installed to neutralise emissions from diesel vehicles will increase for automotive companies, making it difficult to keep car prices competitive.
While German automakers are under scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government is also accused of pampering powerful automakers and ignoring signs of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which suppressed the use of so-called fraudulent devices that allowed it to adjust its exhaust emissions to meet regulations while the car was being tested, but withdrew under normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen drivers have been indicted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics division of Audi’s engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was pulled into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany when authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European emissions requirements, thereby expanding an investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
Audi’s involvement in the investigation could be a major blow to Volkswagen, as a luxury car manufacturer generates a disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s profits.
European Union flags will be purchased for 20,000 euros for Estonian schools.
The Ministry of Education plans to purchase European Union flags for Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the presidency.
A total of 570 educational institutions of the European Union’s flag will receive 105 cm by 158 cm.
Flags are intended for indoor exhibiting, they must be made in high-quality printing technique indoors also with tunnel fastening, according to the Estonian Public Broadcasting news portal.
The banner reads: "A gift to Estonian schools to mark the first Estonian Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of 570 flags is 20,000 euros, i.e. one flag costs 35 euros.
Journalist's murder underscores growing threat in Mexico
Riodoce employees usually meet on Wednesdays to review plans to cover the most recent chaos in Sinaloa state, fueled by organized crime, corrupt officials, and incessant drug wars.
But today, in the shadow of a personal tragedy, they have gathered to discuss their own safety.
They are told that it is important to change your routine.
Two senior writers discuss which seems safer: either bringing the children to an office that was the target of a grenade attack in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the board at the front of the room: "enemies", "neutrals", "allies".
They ask reporters to provide names in each column no proof is needed, impressions and gut feeling are enough.
Drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, and journalists are suspected of being on government or cartel payrolls, along with a whole list of villains who make coverage of the chaos in Mexico dangerous.
There is no respite from violence, and the more bodies pile up across the country, the more journalists there are, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, there have been at least 25,589 journalists under national protection following attacks and threats, and at least seven journalists in seven states have been killed so far this year.
Among the dead was their editor and source of inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug abuse.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence can be felt everywhere on the facade of the Riodoce building, a large picture of Valdez with a middle finger hangs with the inscription "Justice", and two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts depicting his smiling face with glasses or his characteristic Panama hat.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death. Reporters discuss common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate Public Prosecutor’s Office was established in 2010 to handle the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two cases have been brought to justice.
As with most annual murders involving drug trafficking and organised crime, which number in the thousands, killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
Riodoce’s editorial office continues to cover the violence in Sinaloa, even though their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the killers' records and justice, the security meeting won't be much use, Ibarra says.
"It's very silly to waste your time here at a meeting," he says.
"Until you know the reason, you distrust everyone."
Valdez left Riodoce's office in Culiacan on the morning of May 15.
He managed to drive just a few blocks before two men stopped him in a red Toyota Corolla. He was forced out of the car and was shot 12 times. This is presumably because of the name of the newspaper, which translates as "twelveth river".
An armed man drove off in Valdez's car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
Rumors are spreading freely in Culiacan.
However, there is only silence on the subject of Valdez.
Since Guzman’s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country as rival cliques struggle to fill the power vacuum.
It makes no difference whether some or many people are shot in the streets of Sinaloa every day or whether the cemetery is teeming with richly decorated double-decker mausoleums of drug kings, larger than the homes of many of the living.
Let us forget for a moment that peacetime refers to how a maritime state with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States is run by a single cartel.
Despite all of this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers involved in his work, Ismail Bojorquez, the co-founder and CEO of Riodoce (60), has tremendous remorse for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes contributed to the killing.
The first of these was an interview published in February with Damaso Lopez, the leader of the guerrilla cartel that competed with Guzman’s sons and is at war.
This piece of writing may have angered the boys, and suspected gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they reached the newsstands.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after a raid on another newspaper that covered the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues expected him to be there forever.
He worked as a veteran reporter for the Noroeste newspaper in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling shares for $50.
Bojorquez said it was “impossible to deal with the press without addressing the drug problem.”
Over time, the newspaper gained notoriety with its bold and honest coverage, and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters liked to publish vigorous research without fear of censorship, and readers were enchanted by a publication from which they could read stories that no one else dared to cover.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its coverage of Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists (AKK) for his courage to follow Mexican drug stories wherever they lead.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said as he accepted the AKK award.
Last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV, he said that drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa.
“You have to accept the task that comes with being a journalist is another opportunity to play dumb.
I don’t want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths, or why I didn’t tell you what was going on.”
The Riodoce collective misses Valdez, a joker who snorted like a sailor, a friend who kindly shared hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on her routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went to the El Guayabo bar across the street from the office and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if his routine love became fatal to him.
His death has also made them question themselves as to how best to do their jobs and stay alive.
“They don’t like being bullied by their women, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs.”
"These things were not to be touched," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best of times, is strong self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells weird, stay away.
Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal said the problem was that "the sense of smell can be fooled... and that's what happened to Javier."
He and others say that the old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, just as they do not apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce’s employees met for security training, cell phones were suddenly no longer allowed; a few days before that, it was revealed that only government-sold spyware had been used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists.
In front of the house, two police officers were looking for relief from a 40-degree heat in the shade of a tree.
The government assigned them to guard the office of Riodoce, which is located in a four-story building in the middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Some reporters wondered, half-jokingly, if these policemen were among the 50 percent police officers who had been branded unreliable by the governor himself.
Several months have passed since reporters drove into the mountainous countryside, where drug gangs have de facto control.
This week’s edition of Riodoce covered three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the brother of former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing story about spending government money on the governor’s hometown.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official statement about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so you had to be careful when it came time to write down what everyone in town knows about the restaurant is a favorite spot for both drug dealers and the authorities.
The reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics for almost the last century.
Recently, several governors of the IRP have been accused of corruption in widely reported cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at the same location, including how the son of Guzman, nicknamed El Chapo, escaped a military operation.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have searched for a column by Valdez to get information about the kidnapping from the best sources.
"We would have known by now what happened," said 46-year-old Villarreal, whose slim build has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all communication with our sources has been cut off."
Valdez’s office has become a storage room for signs and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, and editorial staff has become something they never expected from activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a couple of signs and headed to the local prosecutor’s office the next morning to protest another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
A burned body has been found and officials say it belongs to him based on DNA tests.
Journalists across the country have become more vocal, scribbling the phrase "SOS press" on sidewalks and buildings as an organized protest.
On this day, President Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to garner international support to bring justice to the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's death at a meeting with Sinaloa governor, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
After that, he asked to be diverted from reporting on the government’s actions, worried that anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said Mexican journalists were “restricted” by organized crime, complicit government officials, and indifferent society.
In his latest book, Drug Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also by politicians and security forces who are in league with organized crime.
Last year, the Articulo 19 media watchdog attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists to police and state officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez said.
The murders are obviously blood-curdling.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found with a note, presumably signed by the Los Zetas cartel: "I'm here for my reports."
Next to his severed head lay a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after their correspondent Miroslava Breach was killed in March.
Others continue to do as El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of their leader in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels with the headline "What do you want from us?" on the front page.
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
This is a nerve-wracking decision.
It is difficult to find a job in exile and they still have to look in the streets to avoid the dangers.
And sometimes they are chased, as was probably the case with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in 2015 in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who stay put and continue to work must dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, admits that covering the drug trade frightens her.
"Mexico is on its way to hell and that's why I started as a reporter," he said.
At midnight on a recent Friday, when the latest number had already been locked, Riodoce’s editors were sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office, sipping beer when suddenly everyone’s phones started vibrating.
In the coastal resort town of Mazatlan, 19 people were reportedly killed in gunfire between rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by several messages left by cartels found in the area.
From the same side of the sidewalk, reporters posted the news on Riodoce’s website using a mobile phone.
The next day the front page needed to be changed.
Sirens roared through another gunfight in the area.
Bojorquez was looking out for the officers on duty to see if they were on alert.
If they were scared, they didn’t show it.
Under a massive portrait of the newspaper’s fallen founder, with his middle finger visible across Sinaloa, Riodoce’s employees were following in his footsteps.
“How could you ever think about closing down,” Bojorquez said, “when the same day Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send him out to the streets to do a report?”
The dinosaur used a defensive color to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, although quite frightening.
Scientists have now revealed the first findings of an incredible rhinoceros creature discovered by a Canadian miner, which has been so well preserved that experts have described it as the "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."
It is so well-preserved that it was even possible to identify that his scaly skin was a reddish-brown color and that his past was somewhat "difficult."
A report published in the journal Current Biology described the creature as "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found" and as "one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a new species of nodosaur that lived in the mid Cretaceous, 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation amazed researchers who describe it as “really remarkable.”
This armored vegetarian is the best preserved type of fossil ever found, according to National Geographic magazine.
It was discovered on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk while he was mining at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that did not resemble the surrounding stone, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
For the next six years, work was done to dig the animal out of a 2,500-pound (1,100-kilogram) piece of land.
After all this hard work, the end result is now finally ready to be released to the public.
"If you squint a little bit, you can almost believe he's asleep," said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is exhibited.
"It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
Studying his skin, the researchers found that this herbivore, though covered in scales and resembling a walking tank, was likely at considerable risk from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This armored dinosaur used red and white armor to hide from predators, and employed a technique of concealment known as counter-shadowing, which is also used by many modern animals.
This allowed the dinosaur to better assimilate into its surroundings and avoid enemies, experts say, as larger dinosaurs likely hunted it.
This 110-million-year-old creature, part of the Nodosaurus family, first made the news in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Scientists have now studied the creature and named it after Mark Mitchell, a lab technician at the Borealopelta markmitchell Museum, who was part of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours in the process of painstakingly exposing the animal.
Thanks to the amazing preservation of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of scales on the animal’s body.
They discovered a counter-shadowing, a defense technique common in the animal kingdom, which means that the upper half of the creature was darker than the lower half.
Although the counter-shade is common, the findings come as a surprise, as Borealopelta is much larger than the animals living with the counter-shade today.
This suggests that the dinosaur was being hunted actively enough by other carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred hiding as a survival tactic rather than confrontation.
However, most modern animals that use the counter-shade — such as deer, zebras, or armadillos — are much smaller and more vulnerable to prey, suggesting that the nodosaurus had to make a real effort to survive.
"The intense hunt for a huge and armored dinosaur shows just how dangerous dinosaurs from the Cretaceous period could have been," Brown said.
A chemical analysis of the armor’s organic compounds also revealed that the dinosaur’s skin was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal for clues about its life, including the preserved contents of its gut, to find out what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur died when it fell into the river, thus reaching the sea with a current, where it sank backwards to the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and the rivers and oceans probably extended much farther inland than they do now.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable because it is fully covered with preserved scaly skin, while remaining three-dimensional, retaining the animal's original shape," Brown said.
"As a result, the animal today looks almost the same as it did in the Cretaceous period.
You don’t have to use your imagination to reconstruct it – just squint your eyes and make it seem like you’re sleeping.”
The Cretaceous period was a time when huge, bipedal, carnivorous dinosaurs—theropods— roamed the Earth.
Although all of their king Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its fearsome predecessors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, a monster 38 feet (11.5 meters) tall and weighing six tons.
Scientists whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta was washed into the sea after death and mummified in the mud.
The creature was discovered on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk while he was mining at the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and scales, and is intact from the muzzle to the hips.
These creatures averaged 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
Two 20-inch spikes protruded from its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this armored herbivore made its way through what is now western Canada until a flooded river washed into its open sea.
But the dinosaur's undersea burial site helped preserve its scales in exquisite detail.
The petrified remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that lumpy armor plates along the dinosaur skulls still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic magazine, "Such a degree of preservation is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
The petrified skin remains still cover the lumpy plates on the animal’s skull.
The right foreleg lies next to him, and the five toes are stretched upward.
I can count the scales on his feet."
How did one activist find the answer to the question "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was in total shock.
Just a day after traveling to New York, this St. Louis resident, via Airbnb, was sitting on a bed in a rented room, browsing Facebook on his phone.
He stumbled upon a post from his former schoolmate.
It said, "The police just killed an 18-year-old boy and he's still lying on the street."
He was confused as to why no one else had posted this information on his feed, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
Posts by a longtime <0x40>TheePharoah user had repeatedly been shared on his timeline.
A rapper from the St. Louis area broadcast live tweets about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street for four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to him or his community.
He put his phone away, but later in the evening saw another tweet announcing that this time people were gathering on Canfield Drive.
They shared photos of a police tape and screaming people, and a man claiming to be Brown's father and holding a sign that said, "The Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
He watched a live stream of a policeman standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another cop cocked a gun, he said, and shouted, "I'm going to kill you all... animals."
Ferrell remembers how he caught himself thinking, “This is unusual.”
"It's not the kind of murder we're used to, which we might call typical."
I felt scared at that moment.
I was angry and crying.”
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., he went to his father to pick up his six-year-old daughter and decided that they would go to Ferguson the next morning alone.
What happened with Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the central theme of the new documentary “Whose Streets?”, which premieres in theaters on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and tenacity from the perspective of the people who live in this community and who filled the streets demanding answers.
When Ferrell and his daughter—who was wearing a flowery dress and wearing a matching crown—were driving toward Ferguson, they had another conversation about what they had been talking about several times before that morning—about the experiences and living conditions of black people.
“Do you remember when I taught you how a black community had to fight for its rights?” he recalls asking himself.
"We're driving to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right."
"I couldn't not bring him," Ferrell said later.
“What is happening now is the culmination of what has happened in the past.
You have to see it, see it, and grow in the middle of it.
She needs to learn about activism and organization, but also about the different layers of black experiences and living conditions, and what we need to do to become free and free ourselves.
Even if I manage to raise her without personally experiencing blatant racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would be doing him a disservice if I protected him from this world.”
The first stop they made when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a place across the street from a police station that had become a sort of campground where activists waited for news of policeman Darren Wilson, who was never charged.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who prepared lunches.
They put food bags together and helped distribute them to the protesters.
For Ferrell, a new type of activism slowly took shape.
"My activism completely changed after August 9," he said, noting that when he was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, he was president of the Minority Nursing Students Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
“I didn’t have any organizational experience.
It all just worked out.”
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, the co-director of one of the films, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said he and film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar simply wanted to document what was going on.
The question that came to Ferrell’s mind was, “Are you trying to document what’s going on, or are you trying to find a story that can be exploited?”
Such skepticism was due to the countless cases of people — often white — coming into the community and trying to take advantage of its pain and resilience.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: “We had heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson are not being heard, and we wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan had already struck hands with co-director Damon Davis, a regional artist known for his activism regarding death row inmates.
His involvement made the project appealing to Ferrell and six other locals who had been watched by the film’s “Whose Streets?” team for years after Brown’s shooting.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or for us, we speak for ourselves," Davis said.
“What was important to me was the way these people are portrayed, because that’s how I’m portrayed.”
While the goal wasn’t to focus on Ferrell’s experience—to show that the movement wasn’t about “redemptive guidance, but community gathering,” as Folayan said—he became the most open-minded actor in the film.
As a result, Whos Streets documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell’s life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing at the first time he saw the finished work.
“But I realized that doing this work and humanizing black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability.”
What’s more, Ferrell’s story highlights and refocuses the role of a black homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three initiators of the movement, who coined the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter after the murder of black teenage Trayvon Martin in 2012, are homosexual.
“Black homosexual women in leading roles have kept the movement going in general,” Ferrell said, “and that’s because we have to constantly fight on many fronts.
Black gay women have to carry all that burden."
Folayan agreed, noting that “the movement is indeed being kept alive by black women, and many of them are black homosexual women.”
He argues, however, that "it's not some kind of equal opportunity thing" - Ferrell was not chosen to be the centerpiece of the film because of his identity.
"He was a person who radiated the right energy," she said.
"But it's no coincidence that she was right on the front line, because there's a lot at stake as a black homosexual woman living at these crossroads.
You can see his energy through the screen.”
Meanwhile, news cameras from Ferguson have long since disappeared, but racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile.
Ferrell has been given a suspended sentence of 2.5 years for blocking the road.
He describes the socio-political climate in the area he calls home as simply “a bustle of thrashing.”
Nevertheless, he still considers important the mantra he has etched in his memory since he took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.”
7 Ways to Get Over a Hangover After a Weekend Party
Some of the tougher lads will find a way to help after a party.
Or, as the saying goes, “Avoid hangovers, stay drunk.”
But this is only an inevitable postponement and a decent jock for health.
What can you do to feel better in the morning after this and tomorrow’s Weekend party – or any other party – and get through the hangover as painlessly as possible?
Drink some water.
Drink alcohol down and on, after a big party in the morning... or possibly even instead of alcohol.
Since the body loses a lot of fluid when it consumes alcohol, it must somehow recover it.
Minerals are also flushed out of the body with water, so it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often irritated after drinking, it is especially good if it is bubble-free or only slightly carbonated.
Go for a walk.
It would certainly not be worth heading to Grandma's to chop down trees with a hangover - this could prove to be a fatal wrong decision.
But a light walk helps the body to remember what it feels like to be alive again.
Lying in a tent and sleeping out a hangover is a more time-consuming way to heal.
Give energy back to the body slowly and carefully.
If you’re already sick from yesterday’s binge, don’t try to load a big fat steak into your stomach.
For example, start with fresh juice, which contains fruit sugars that will slowly invigorate your body.
If you’re already healthy at lunch, you might want to try soup.
And a little later, the back.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic will rid your body of any water.
Water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you take an analgesic to prevent a hangover in the evening, your liver has to deal with acetaminophen or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol, and so loses performance.
You'll ruin your liver even more, and your hangovers will be worse.
In addition, the pain does not last very long in the body.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, don’t do it on an empty stomach – it will irritate your already ragged stomach.
If you don’t have a partner, get along well with yourself.
It’s like walking, but you can’t have an orgasm when you walk.
However, avoid overly active paces and crazy postures - during hangovers, physical exertion should be moderate.
You've got to be kidding.
Talk foolishly with your friends, do simple silly things, and laugh at yourself and others (suffering) in a friendly way.
Jokes and laughter may not make you giddy, but they certainly make it more fun to endure.
One day, the hangover will pass anyway.
Northwestern professor and Oxford University employee wanted for murder
Police say they are searching nationwide for a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee who have become suspects after the body of a man with fatal stab wounds was found in a luxury Chicago apartment.
According to Cook County court documents, warrants for the arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren were issued on Monday on charges of first-degree murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after multiple stabbings.
According to a warning issued by the Chicago Police Department to the community, the body was discovered on July 27.
Police received a phone call and found a victim with multiple stab wounds on her body when they arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment building.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene, and investigators are treating the stabbing as a murder, while police are actively searching for the two suspects.
Lathem has been a co-professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of public relations at the university, said in an emailed statement that Lathem had now been temporarily suspended from work and was barred from entering Northwestern University campuses.
“This is now a criminal case under investigation by competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating with investigators,” Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior assistant in the finance department at Oxford University.
A representative from the University and Somerville College said in an e-mailed statement: “We have been in touch with the British police and are ready to assist the US investigative agencies in any way we can.”
In addition, the statement said Warren's colleagues were "shocked" and "wanted him to turn himself in".
Chicago Police Department Communications Director Anthony Guglielmi urges suspects to turn themselves in.
"Police have an idea of where they are, but we are working increasingly intensively to pinpoint the exact location," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities are helping to search for the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment building, who had just received a cryptic hint that something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police said it was a grim sight.
According to Guglielm, it is not clear whether the event itself took place on July 27.
He said security cameras confirmed Lathem and Warren were inside the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi added.
In a letter to residents, Grand Plaza officials said: “Police are currently working to establish the chronology of the events and the background of the victim and are investigating various motives, including the possibility of a family dispute.”
Startups to help your business avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction in her e-commerce startup, but the polls were inconclusive.
The answers were often vague, useless, or, even worse, misleading.
And even though he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust the process.
“This system was simply not consistent and objective,” said Errett, who runs Madison Reed, an e-commerce company that sells hair care products in San Francisco with 75 employees.
So he called on outsiders to help him.
New types of human resource start-ups are emerging to help companies find out what their employees are feeling.
By developing and licensing software that is specifically designed to measure employee engagement, they enable companies to conduct sudden surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and a hotline for complaints, and, in some cases, allow linguists to bypass C-level managers and turn directly to the board.
"Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your business?" asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City startup Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
According to Erretti, in the three years she has been using Glint, she has gained a much better understanding of what her employees think and feel.
In addition to sudden surveys and surveys targeted at specific teams, it offers a company heat map that provides an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing them to identify the causes.
Companies have come to realize that they need to stay abreast of their working culture in order not to become the next Uber that has been embroiled in scandals since a former employee posted a blog post describing a harrowing environment that punished those who dared to speak out.
For startups like Glint, the desire to have an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global area of management, regulation and compliance could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to financial technology statistics website Let’s Talk Payments.
Convercent, a Denver-based Colorado-based start-up that helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, noted an increase in interest and activity against the backdrop of Uber’s dubious reputation this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized impulse surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps from problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous messaging line that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when it comes to the CEO, complaints go directly to the board of directors.
“Public opinion has been hijacked by regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercenti.
Quinlan said that if a company is found to be mistreating its employees or behaving unethically, the company could face serious consequences, such as consumer boycotts, employee departures and lawsuits, even if regulators do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees at 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the rules and procedures and provide an easy way to interact with the corporate headquarters.
If the employee wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find the phone number or email address of the corporate headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope that it would be taken seriously.
This was often a daunting and uncomfortable process, said James Vitrano, general counsel for Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, however, it is possible for problems such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair pay practices, which previously did not reach managers who operated in offices in other cities or states, to be identified and addressed more quickly.
“I’m able to get closer to a holistic 360-degree employee experience,” said Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday’s risk management team.
"And we're protecting our shareholders from lawsuits against employees."
Quinlan said companies began to take ethical behavior, values, and employee engagement much more seriously in 2002, after the Arthur Andersen audit firm collapsed due to ethical violations in connection with the Enron scandal.
But it wasn’t until “social media became mature” that companies realized they couldn’t stop their dirty laundry from being publicly washed online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behavior, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies a periodic fee for the use of their products.
It’s a business model and an opportunity that has the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both startups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million in funding from Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising $47 million in raised capital.
Bessemer Venture Partners invested $10 million in Glint in November, raising the company’s total funding to $60 million.
Such investments come as no surprise when you consider the interrelationship between companies, culture and venture capital.
More and more research shows that today’s workers expect more from the workplace than ever before.
Competitive markets such as Silicon Valley have high salaries and interesting projects with mere stakes on the table.
Employees want to feel accepted and valued and that they are devoting their time to a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy in a company, feel heard, and that the work they do is rewarding, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of the general benefit and employee experience department at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn revenue when the companies in their portfolios do well; companies do well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, then it’s no wonder they find support.
Having data on employee involvement is important, according to the experts of the working culture.
But this data is useless unless the company’s supervisors do something about it.
In fact, when a company asks its employees for feedback, it can create expectations that change will come.
And if the changes don’t happen fast enough or not at all, it can lead to frustration and reduce employee engagement.
“If you’re asking for 4,000 proposals, you need to be prepared for 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, president of consulting and business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
“Because when things don’t get done, the employees think, ‘Did you really listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?"
According to Erretti, Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly surveys among employees, has been able to implement the measures on the same day the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from disappointed employees about the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganize several teams in the company and offer communication training to deal with problems.
However, Ruby Tuesdays is collecting new data on employees and it is hoped that in the long term this will lead to a longer-term commitment by employees in an industry known for its high workforce turnover.
“If you’re not committed to transparency, you’re going to lose people,” Vitrano said.
When you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose businesses.”
The brightest star of the euro area is the Baltics: incomes are growing rapidly
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltics, the three Baltic states are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes, referring to a report by the European Central Bank.
According to the central bank’s data, since 1999, the gross output per capita of the economy in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
Low debt, rapidly improving institutions and business- and free-market-friendly policies are behind the success.
“The Baltic states, along with Slovakia, are among the few in the euro area where real GDP per capita by purchasing power has significantly converged towards the EU average,” the central bank said in a statement.
Although the goal is to equalise the gross output of the economy per capita with the richer Western Europe, in 2015 the gross output of the Baltic economies per capita was only 2/3 of the average of the 15 countries that were members of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement.
Low wages have led Balts to seek better wages abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic countries in a positive light and the economy is growing this year, the local people are not enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of the population in Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies were doing very well, or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, slightly less than half of those surveyed thought this about the economies of their countries.
The NCAA’s decision to cancel twice-daily trainings makes Bruins days long
It’s almost 11pm when a group of UCLA football players stop to chat at the edge of a new practice field on the team’s campus.
Some have stripped off their shirts, exposing their sweaty backs to the first day of training camp efforts.
For a large part of the team, these idle minutes offer a midday break.
Summer course participants head back to the dormitory to study for their final exams after three hours of practice before returning to the Wasserman Football Centre for meetings at 6:30 the following morning.
"The next three days will be a real challenge for them," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday.
The NCAA’s decision to cancel the twice-daily workouts to reduce players’ workload has actually made their days longer — at least until the final exams are over on Friday.
For this reason, the first three training sessions at UCLA were scheduled to start at 7:15 p.m. to fit into the already tight schedule of players.
Switching from two workouts per day means more days with one workout – the start of the Bruins training camp was raised almost a week ahead of the previous season, and for the first time in Mora’s six Westwood seasons, trainings take place during summer courses.
They will have 18 practice sessions until August 20, before the official preparations begin for the September inaugural match against Texas A&M.
According to Mora, he is in favor of the NCAA rule change, although it adds another agenda item to players’ tight schedules.
"They have a huge load on three or four days and that's a serious challenge," Mora said.
“And they will break through this trial; they will exert themselves, they will be fine young men.
I think when Saturday comes and we have more time, it’s going to be really nice.”
When the camp is over, UCLA will make the trainings closed, which is not an easy task, given the clear view of their squares from the nearby parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Centre, a high-end hotel that has already been hit by footballs bypassing the safety net around the goalpost.
Starting this weekend, the hotel will be occupied by Bruins players, but Mora admitted that problems may arise with vacant rooms during the season.
"We're implementing security measures," Mora said.
“It’s a real concern and it’s not an exaggeration to think that people can rent a room and film a workout from there.
If you have a record of your training, it could be a pretty good deal.
But we're gonna use security down there and in parking lot eight.
We make the best use of what we have.
I try not to worry too much about it.
We have a plan in place.”
In retaliation, the Savisaare-Ivanova election coalition born for the Centre Party, the coalition of Kristiina Ojuland, who was expelled from the Reform Party, and Maria Kaljuste, who was forced to leave the Estonian Conservative People’s Party (EKRE) – the coalition of creative businessmen called Tegus Tallinn – seems to be participating in the local elections at least as much as the party’s coalition, which was formed on the initiative of those who have been burned in party politics.
But chicks are counted in the fall, and the key question becomes whether there are enough disappointed voters for all of them.
Who will stay with Savisaar?
If the number of supporters of Edgar Savisaar has decreased, one can guess from the events organised in honour of his election coalition.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and current Centre Party members and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the election coalition?
And can the reason why some of Savisaar’s loyal supporters and friends avoid running in Tallinn be found in the fact that the perpetrators’ “Savisaar list”, which is headed by corrupters and suspects of corruption crimes, is becoming a reality?
A music video filmed on the roof of the district government for a Russian-language pop song with the participation of the Lasnamäe district elder; and a rudimentary computer game in which the main character, Prime Minister J<0xC3><0xBC>ri Ratas, must avoid puddles and squirrels while riding his bike - is this the first time the Centre Party is seeking the votes of 16- and 17-year-old voters admitted to the ballot boxes?
We are waiting to see what other parties think of the youth-friendly election campaign.
If, from the beginning of August, Channel 2 or TV3 viewers receive a black square instead of an entertainment show, there are two options: to agree that in the future, only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinna TV and English-language France24 channels will be seen on free-to-air, or to give up the tenth of each month to some television operator.
There are probably also those who, at first, openly rejoice in the ad-free television experience, but who, in the end, pay - albeit reluctantly - for the television programme and the advertisements.
The deafening music, the noisy crowd and the rubbish left on the streets are the unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
If you don’t want to be part of the noise yourself, instead of getting a headache at home, you should go and discover your homeland – and leave the sleeping place for a hefty sum to the festival guests.
Washington to change green card rules
US President Donald Trump has said he is planning a new US immigration plan that will change the rules of the green card.
The plan includes a reduction in the number of legal immigrants per year to 50,000, stricter rules on obtaining temporary work visas, and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill will be debated in two chambers of Congress.
“This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save billions of dollars in taxpayers’ money by changing the way the United States issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme.
“The new application process will give an advantage to candidates who speak English and have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills to benefit our economy,” Trump said.
Young Siberian Seto move to the city, retirees return to the country.
Yevseyev Anatoli continues the tradition of the famous Seto gold miners along the River Maana.
He works as a driver in a gold bullion truck on the tributary of the River Kuwai, 140 kilometres from his home in Maana.
It’s a tough job: two months in a row with no days off, 12 hours of work and then only ten days at home and back again.
Anatoli has only seen gold once in his three years at Artell.
“There’s a hard procedure: when you go in, you’re thoroughly checked to make sure you don’t bring any vodka, and when you go out, you’re checked to make sure you don’t bring any gold,” Anatoli says.
Mare Piho talking to the local Seto Jaan in the village of Haida, who has told her a lot about her family’s memories in Siberia.
The still-preserved archaic culture of the Siberian Setos will also begin to affect the home setos, because it is just so fabulous, thinks Piho Mare, who has studied the remote setos in the most detail.
This year marks the 30th anniversary of his first expedition to Siberia.
During this time, he has been there 14 times and lived there together for a year.
How many Setus still migrated to Siberia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to get land here?
This is an unresolved issue.
I'd say 8,000.
I figured it out from the stories of the Siberian Seto men, who have thought about it themselves.
It is difficult to say exactly, because at that time up to 30 people could come in one group, but the passport was given only to the man.
Only one passport was issued, but he had children, sisters and other female relatives.
Look at the size of the territory here!
It was several times larger than the historical Setomaa.
It had to be taught and managed in some way.
Setos came here as peasants, but their life changed, because here they ended up in areas that were not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (salt rafting), gold mines, industry.
For example, in New-Petser, many Setos later went to work in the secret city of Krasnoyarsk-45 (where the Soviet power built a uranium enrichment plant - J.P.) when it was formed.
Did the Setos make up the majority of the population in the area at the time?
Yes, they lived compactly.
In addition, there was a long tradition of marriage and many children.
Seven or eight children were common in the family.
How much did the culture of the Siberian Setos differ from that of the Setos of the motherland?
They are different, although what was brought here was once the same there.
They brought a lot of clothes.
They made their own (people’s clothes), but they always made a difference between what was brought and what was done here.
Climate change had a strong impact on the traditional clothing of Setos, because it is colder here.
The food changed.
In Setomaa, for example, meat was salted, but here it was just frozen.
Where are the Seto villages in Siberia and what kind of life is there? / graphic: Alari Paluots
The connection with the motherland was strong mentally, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now this Setumaa is going to give back to them, it is going to affect them.
The girls who have lived here in families have listened to amazing stories.
Piho means the people of the Estonian Seto delegation who came to Haida for the Seto Kingdom Day in the beginning of July and lived in their homes for four days - J.P.
What's left of it, it's amazing.
"It is very easy to come and go to Tapa, because the city has a great location: at the railway junction and at the junction of the roads," says Reigo Tamm, an opera soloist from Tapa.
The city has long ceased to be just a military capital, we have a lot of nature, sports and cultural places, and pizza is available on every corner.
Kill is a top-notch city!
There is a small island by the Valgej<0xC3><0xB5>gi River that runs through the town, where the slaughterers usually have a Midsummer party.
"You can't see this beautiful place from the train window," Reigo grunts.
Those who are not afraid of cold water can swim in this river, because the river is full of springs.
I’ve been swimming there, I can do it.
You can have a picnic by the river and just do romance - you can watch the river flow and think about life ahead and backwards.
I’ve been there with my girlfriends.
Besides everything else, the opera soloist Tamm has been on the riverbank between three bridges practicing his arias: "Because this place is by the city, no one may come if I hum my own stories".
"There is a wonderful view of Tapa from Männikämägi hill, but there are also health trails where you can run, ski in winter and now play disc golf - the golf course has been completed, discs can be rented from the sports centre," Reigo says.
The old pros go there with their discs, of course, but I haven't played there yet.
We should probably invite our colleague Rasmus Kull to visit Tapa, as he is an experienced disc golfer and has discs.
I think he's gonna lend me some money!
Reigo and Männikumägi were inseparable during the childhood of the current opera soloist.
At least during the holidays.
There are a lot of tears, disappointments and victories on this mountain in my sports life.
Not to mention the broken sleds and skis.
“The whole city centre is currently full of construction works, all of this is becoming unrecognizable,” Reigo praises.
The old and tired Tapa railway station building, however, is a very attractive place where summer performances are played.
I am glad that in 2012 R.A.A.A.M. manager Märt Meos accepted my idea and came to the railway station to do summer theatre with his theatre.
Although this year’s theatre season with Alexei Karenin has just ended, on 11 August there will be “Elluärkamine” at the railway station, when people move around in the old railway station building in the 1980s.
"From 11th to 13th August, Tapa City Days will be held, during which after the opening of the railway station, the home cafes will be opened and a series of cultural events will take place, including the People's Rally," says Reigo, who recommends visiting the 91-year-old city during those days.
The museum has been housed in a small yellow house on 1 May avenue since 1994.
“The house is small, but there are a lot of exhibits and a lot of information,” Reigo praises the place, which is full of the history of the city of Tapa, most of which focuses on railways and military affairs.
Reigo smiles that if you go to all the recommended places in Tapa, you will eventually get hungry, but luckily the small town is full of cafes.
“We have such good places to eat, and sitting in cafes sometimes makes you feel like you’re abroad,” he describes.
Educated and young soldiers come to Tapa to spend a lot of time in pubs and cafes, so sitting there it is a strange feeling that you are in Estonia and your home town, but there is such an international group around you.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we move a lot!
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
BTV quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying that two Bulgarians had been arrested in Greece for illegal camping.
On the morning of 1 August, police arrested a group of people who had camped illegally on the Sithonia peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but an investigation is underway.
The Foreign Ministry told bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased restrictions on free camping and are already imposing severe fines on anyone who gets caught resting in an unscheduled place.
Inspections will continue throughout the season.
The judge said the court could impose a fine.
Puppies teach wolves how to break sheep.
After a year break, Hiiumaa farmers have to give the wolves "learning material" from their herd again - apparently the wolves who have taught puppies have already broken a lot of sheep.
This year, wolves have broken sheep in Hiiu county three times, a total of 23 sheep and eight injured, writes Hiiu Leht.
Last year it was only 3, the year before it was 124.
The data of the Environmental Agency that no wolf nests were born in Hiiumaa last year and the information of the Hiiumaa Hunting Council that this year two wolf nests have been fixed on the island are also in sync with the burglaries.
On Monday night, wolves broke 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna in Emmaste and injured half of the 18 surviving sheep.
In the early hours of Wednesday, wolves broke a sheep in the pastures of Reheselja village and seriously injured one of you, who had to be killed in an emergency.
The rules for handling genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent the Bill on Amendments to the Release into Environment of Genetically Modified Organisms Act (GMOVS) and the Plant Protection Act.
With the amendment to the Act, the establishment of a separate database for the locations of genetically modified (GM) crops as well as for handlers will be waived, for which the plant health register will be used in the future.
In addition, the obligation of a GM crop operator to have a prior agreement with a person engaged in apiculture within the prescribed radius will be amended.
Although genetically modified crops are not grown in Estonia at the moment, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of genetically modified and non-genetically modified crops.
This is at least until a decision has been made to declare Estonia GMO-free," said Sigmar Suu, Head of the Plant Health Department at the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
"At the same time, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be purposeful and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burden for both the private and public sectors," Suu added.
The Bill repeals the provisions of the GMOVS related to the database of locations of GM crops and handlers and to the handling training, and establishes the requirements for the handling of GM crops and commencement of economic activities.
In the specific context of apiculture, the current obligation for GM crop growers to inform beekeepers of the start of GM crop cultivation is replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before the start of cultivation.
The Bill has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to examine it in the information system of draft legislation and, if they wish, submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The planned changes will primarily affect persons active in the field of crop production, beekeepers and the Agricultural Board.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop is allowed to be grown – MON 810 maize.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing GM crops.
This is due to the fact that there is no maize pest in Estonia, i.e. the European var. diet, to which maize line MON 810 is resistant.
Also, the varieties of this corn variety are bred for the southern regions, and this corn is not suitable for our climatic conditions.
The Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies in 2015 and 2016 to detect possible contamination with GM organisms in the seeds of different summer rape, maize and soy varieties grown in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain any foreign genes and as a result of the study it was concluded that the seeds of rape, maize and soy grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
From the above, it can be concluded that no genetically modified crops are deliberately grown in Estonia, and it was also confirmed that there has been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United recruited Nemanja Matic in the form of a “genius”
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have recruited a “genius” in the form of Nemanja Matic after midfielder Sampdoria made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
A <0xC2><0xA3>40m buyout from Chelsea kicked off United's last pre-season match in Dublin ahead of the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, winning 2-1 in the starting line-up, impressing in a defensive role, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to attack.
However, having missed the Blues' pre-season Asian tour, Matic was badly short of a match and only lasted 45 minutes, which Mourinho said would need to be improved well before the Premier League season begins.
“He needs time, but he has experience, he has intelligence, he has a brilliant mindset – he has a football mentality,” Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get in shape as soon as possible."
Like Matic, the other new recruits, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku, also started in the starting line-up at Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho began to set his eleven starting men in place by the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three footballers, but he confirmed that the club has already done a "great job" by signing three of his four priority selections.
“I am grateful to the club for being able to realise three out of four,” he added.
“I’ll be even happier if they can do four out of four, but they’ve worked hard for me.”
Another crane cub got a GSM transmitter on his leg on 1 August and this time in Muhu.
According to Mati Martinson, a bird watcher living in S<0xC3><0xB5>rve, the first stork chick was born in an escorted S<0xC3><0xB5>rve and this litter is already flying around, has left the nest site and has joined the large overnight group of Mullutu-Suurlahe.
This is because there are no grain fields in S<0xC3><0xB5>rve, the Voice of the Islands writes.
This Tuesday, relatively late for ringing the cranes, another storkling was caught on the transmitter and that was on Muhu island.
According to Martinson, the installation of the transmitters is actually an international project led by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year, a storkling named Mati was equipped with a GSM transmitter in S<0xC3><0xB5>rves T<0xC3><0xBC>rju.
"His activities are visible on the internet: how he went to Spain to winter, came back to Germany and Poland for a long time and then came to Saaremaa," Martinson said.
A British inventor had a microchip implanted into his body to gain access to the house and car with a hand gesture.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so he could open his front door, get into an office and even start a car with a simple gesture of his hand.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Northam had a tiny chip inserted between his thumb and forefinger and now offers this service through his company BioTeq to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthesiologist at the Royal Hospital in Hampshire County, Hants, Winchester, to ensure that the installation procedure meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip for cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
The Northam company also replaces locks on houses and cars to make them compatible with the chip, charging <0xC2><0xA3>300 for one lock.
This married father of one child has now installed the technology both at home and in his BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the steering wheel.
The White House bill cost taxpayers thousands of dollars.
According to military documents disclosed to TIME magazine, the White House’s decision to fly a Navy helicopter last month cost taxpayers as much as $24,000 for an event celebrating American production in the southern courtyard.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One during the President’s stay on board, was the central attraction of an event introducing American construction programs that took place at the White House on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior White House officials reviewed industrial products from all 50 states during their tour.
The helicopter, built in Connecticut, was exhibited along with a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift truck made in Mississippi.
According to documents from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House War Cabinet required the helicopter’s presence on FARGO, a part of the order, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the southern courtyard for an “unusual” event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because this is an unusually high-profile event," the HMX-1 commander said in an email to his commanding officer, a senior naval officer in the aviation industry, a day before the event.
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive in the southern yard at around 7 a.m. on July 17 for an event starting at 3 p.m. and would remain there until the yard was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. on the same evening.
It added that if there were to be a delay in leaving the White House, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to working-time restrictions.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the incident, and the squadron's security team remained close to the aircraft throughout its stay on the ground.
It was not possible to determine from the documents given to TIME magazine whether a second crew was eventually needed or not.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using government property for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 investigated whether the event could violate this provision.
“We asked if it violated Hatch’s law, and we were told it wasn’t,” the commander wrote.
"You don't seem to have a choice," replied the deputy chief of staff.
The White House declared the event "made in America" an official event, and Hatch's law would not have covered it.
But even official events have political undertones.
The President supported the efforts of the health care reform discussed in the Senate at the time and praised efforts to keep government regulations under control.
The use of the aircraft known as ‘Marine One’ or ‘Air Force One’ for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents have to use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them purely for photo sessions is unusual.
Trump came to attention in February when his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, rolled into the background a presidential plane, and his Twitter account is teeming with messages complaining about how his predecessor used the president’s plane.
“The White House is very pleased with the America-Made exhibit, which showcases products from all 50 states made from American materials by American workers,” said Lindsay Walters, White House Assistant Press Secretary.
HMX-1 crews often test-fly around Washington and in the southern courtyard to practice the placement at the White House to the nearest centimeter accuracy.
While Trump was in Germany at the G20 summit in early July, HMX-1 held 58 test landings in the White House courtyard.
According to the official, the flight to the event "made in America" was included in the standard of training flights of the flight crew that month.
Squadron helicopters flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
According to the White House, no other exhibit at the event was a burden on the taxpayer’s wallet.
Sikorsky’s representative said the company was not involved in the organisation of the helicopter’s display in the southern courtyard.
HMX-1 does not keep the budget documents for presidential flights, and the exact cost of the event is difficult to determine.
But according to the Department of Defense's hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the VH-3D compensation rate is $24,380 per flight hour.
The squadron's records stated the flight's length from its base at Navy Quantico Airfield in Virginia, both directions, to be 30 minutes.
The White House says the actual cost of operating a helicopter is well below that amount.
"Calculating taxpayers' costs on the basis of estimated reimbursement rates is very misleading," Walters said.
"These estimated reimbursement rates shall include staff, maintenance and many other irrecoverable costs, which shall be taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to the 2015 RAND study, the Ministry of Defence’s compensation rates do not include personnel costs, but they do cover fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of helicopters at the event.
"The point is to show the things that were made in America this week," Spicer said.
And I know that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they are contributing to our national security and that there are supposed to be hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
So, of course, it’s right to point that out.”
It’s not clear whether Trump came in contact with a helicopter during a tour of the southern courtyard, but he did sit behind the wheel of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump appealed to Sikorsky’s representatives, making fun of the company’s products in his personal aircraft fleet.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” said the president, “I have three of their products.”
Grit <0xC5><0xA0>adeiko – through tears came peace and joy
At the 2011 World Cup in Daegu, <0xC5><0xA0>adeiko was hit in the last area, a 800 m footrace was run and a stretcher was taken from the stadium.
Just before that, he had scored a zero in a long jump at a Chinese universiade.
The 2012 European Championships in Helsinki was ruined by a javelin throw, but in London he finished 23rd with 6013 points.
However, the misfortune continued.
At the 2013 World Championships in Moscow, an Estonian who was on a record long jump schedule received a thumb injury after the opening day.
Two years later, he finished 15th at the World Championships in Beijing and met the Olympic standard, but this had also meant more disappointment for the athlete.
Shadeiko passed the heaviest flag only last year, when she did not receive the result at the start of her long jump at the Amsterdam European Championships.
I would just like to put together a good multi-competition once in a while.
One time,” Shadeiko confessed.
Worse was yet to come: a month later, his Olympic tournament in Rio was interrupted by a femoral injury on the first bar.
It’s time to take it down – can we continue with the seven races at all?
Is two days worth it?
She thought for a long time, but found peace.
I was able to clear my head
This experience is relatively hard to describe, but I’ve thought that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal and clear my head.
"I knew I wasn't going to put the pill in the bag yet," Shadeiko says of her self-cleaning.
I was able to turn a blank page and move forward with a new momentum.
According to coach Anne Mägi, it was very difficult to look at the suffering of a ward, but she understood that the athlete must first of all find out about himself.
He was so spoiled by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
"Grit said she wouldn't give up and wanted to prove to herself what she was worth," says Mägi.
Now he has some kind of peace.
He does it for his own pleasure.
The competition came back in May, when <0xC5><0xA0>adeiko set a new Estonian record of 6280 points at the multi-competition in G<0xC3><0xB6>tzis.
In a high-level competition, he improved his personal top mark in the shot put by nearly a metre (13.89) and ran a hurdle in near-record time.
Then the multi-competitor felt that it was not the ceiling of ability at all, but only the primary competition hunger was extinguished.
For years, he has been taught by Mägi, who says that Shadeiko is a model student.
He's a ready-made athlete, he's good to train.
When something goes wrong, he says it right away.
She knows her body and trusts her senses.
That's what we're supposed to do.
I cannot tell you exactly what to do, and we will follow suit.
Shadeiko has also found a new approach.
"I'm not the kind of person who makes the most out of training", he says, and says that the most important thing is to get the right feeling, because it also guarantees a good result.
Your baby’s happiness will make you happy.
The happiness of those close to Shadeiko has also provided good emotions.
Both her former training partner Maris Mägi and sister Grete recently became parents, and the multi-athlete has received support from new world citizens.
"It's been quite interesting," says Shadeiko.
One drink of alcohol is equivalent to “training” the brain.
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Shepherd is such a big fan of wine that he believes that wine can train the brain better than anything else in the world.
Shepherd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
It’s not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather about the “very active” process of tasting wine.
By smelling the glass, spinning the wine, enjoying it and sensing the aftertaste, we put our brains to work to create a taste for the wine.
According to Shepherd, wine molecules don’t actually contain taste, but the taste comes from the way the wine stimulates the brain.
He compares how the brain “sees” colors.
“The taste is not in the wine, the taste is created by the wine taster,” says Shepherd.
Things that still affect the taste of wine are, for example, our age, gender, and even the amount of saliva a person produces.
Shepherd, of course, admonishes that wine is not for getting drunk.
“There has to be more to it,” he says.
If you sip too much, the system is oversaturated.
Drinking too much wine can harm your brain rather than benefit it – according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine are at risk of memory loss, loss of balance, and reduced mental capacity.
10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector are paid less than their colleagues
Data from the staff search company Fontes reveals that 10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector are paid less than their colleagues.
There is a 10% pay gap between men and women, according to Genius.
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the Fontes ICT Sector Salary Survey.
A total of 8,577 positions were surveyed.
63% of positions were occupied by men.
"Although only three companies stated that the pay gap is in men's favour and the other companies said that there is no pay gap, in reality, in comparison with similar jobs, men's basic monthly salary is on average 10% higher than women's and men's total annual salary on average 8% higher than women's," said Ilmar P<0xC3><0xB5>hjala, an analyst at Fontese.
Narcose Season 3 commercial: Now that Pablo Escobar is gone, the Cali Cartel is at the center of Netflix’s hit series
Despite the revelation of Pablo Escobar’s killer in the second season of Narcos, the Netflix series is far from over.
The third and fourth seasons have been confirmed by the streaming service, and the first one has already produced an advertising clip that teases the series with new villains.
In season three, the DEA turns its attention to the Cali cartel, the world’s richest drug trafficking organization.
They operate under the leadership of four powerful godfathers “like a Fortune 500 company,” just with more bribery to the government and more violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of its ties with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is active in New York.
In a newly released commercial, Pedro Pascal is returned as Javier Penana, a character who enlists the help of American and Colombian law enforcement in the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe, and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcose will open on September 1.
Afghan democracy depends on women’s role in politics, UN says
The head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN relief mission, said hundreds of women were running for local council elections, three women were running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters were women.
“The importance of women cannot be overstated,” she said in a statement Wednesday.
The elections can only truly represent the people and be credible if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
Afghanistan’s local council elections and presidential elections will be held on April 5.
The Taliban, for their part, have threatened the electoral process, which coincides with a transitional period when the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
This year's elections mark the first time that power has been peacefully transferred from one democratically elected government to another.
According to Haysom, the strong role of women will increase the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.
The joy of sharing makes everything more fun for both adults and children.
There is always too little time together, but working out with kids is a good opportunity to combine being together, playing, being close to each other and being burdened.
And what a convenient solution - no matter where you cruise in the summer, live dumbbells will always be with you and with their thin voice impatiently remind you: "Let's work out now too!"
Start with a warm-up - it's very good to play a regular hawk or run along the beach.
The squat is the foundation for keeping your legs and buttocks in shape - who would want to take the shape of a sand cake washed out of the waves during the summer?
It is wonderful to use children instead of levers!
First of all, it is safe and comfortable, the weight gradually increases at the same rate as the strength of the trainer.
The advanced ones can also do squats with very large children.
The child exercises balance, reads repetitions and has fun with the possibility of being high and important.
Older children can do the squats themselves at the same time.
Set the range of motion by touching the ground and stretching out your arms.
Keep your fingers straight, ask the mini-helper to hold on tight.
The child can read repetitions and feel like a coach.
Plank is a super-useful, but hopelessly boring exercise for the child.
But it’s easy to make it more fun!
Game plank: take a long plank column, from which you take turns to crawl through.
It's actually harder than usual, but a lot more fun to do when you can shake a friend's hand in the meantime.
To increase the load, you can stay in a plank, a little on the back, and also walk around in this position.
As an added bonus, a small child can be seated on the hips, but this exercise will provide fun for all children.
While crabs scrape through the sand, the triceps, buttocks, and abs get a load like a snack.
The child descends on his feet so that his body weight is equally distributed forward and backward.
You can hold hands for safety.
Bend your legs and stretch straight up.
Puppy can fly, have fun, train balance and be difficult.
The life of a little coach is extra fun when he gets a little kiss every time he comes up.
The extra load is provided by stretching the legs forward.
Make sure your back is in a neutral position.
Children themselves have much more fun doing the abdominal muscles in pairs and with clapping.
A squat with a hand job and a pulse.
Observe the safety of the child, the position of the knee, and keep the spine in a neutral position.
All children's favorite and great fun!

From the Philippines to the world or <0xC3><0x95>lgkot’s trip to the heart of fashion fans
Straw woven bags are a summer classic that has become a hit product in recent years, which a true summer savvy has to hang on their hands and to which merchants, despite its modest origins, have been able to weld a price tag that fits the hit.
A bag made of straw is probably one of those things that everyone has had once in their life and the possession of which has not caused any special emotions.
It just exists, and if it doesn’t, nothing is broken.
Now the straw bags are making a real comeback and the fashion fans have switched their fancy designer bags for the summer months instead to simple straw woven bags.
It’s not just a beach bag, but it’s just as popular today as a street bag, and bolder women even walk into the office with it.
At this point, however, it is worth finding out first whether a summer look like this is still sitting for the boss or it is worth pushing the wet and the laptop to a slightly more official sumada.
But diversity has made straw bags a true summer love for women.
For example, when reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing that comes to mind is that fashion gourmands rush to the local market and buy a straw bag, which they are loyal to for the whole holiday and which goes along with the beach, the market and hanging out with their friends in the city.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy more bags from the market and sell or give them away to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting that the demand for bags among readers is so great that in the real world women (and men!) would probably go hand in hand-to-hand to become the happy owner of a bag.
In some ways, this madness is also understandable, because it is rare that you can buy something that has risen to the status of a hit in the fashion world for just a few dozen euros.
It is true that clever merchants have also discovered an easy way to make money here, and this is how finer luxury brands sell straw bags for a few hundred and a thousand euros.
Probably so that the richer customers wouldn’t have to feel like mere mortals who parade around with some cheap bags.
For example, it is possible to buy a straw bag from Dolce & Gabbana that costs over one thousand euros.
For Chanel’s shoulder bag interpretation, however, you can buy around 6000 euros.
Unlike most fashionistas, straw bags don’t come from some big fashionistas, but their story started far away.
The straw bags are said to come from far away in the Philippines, where they have spread out into the world.
Weaving a bag of straw is primarily an export business and the locals don’t even see them very often.
The technique is said to date back to the 14th century and is quite similar to ordinary basket weaving.
However, since you don’t have to weave the straw bag as strongly as the basket, you can weave patterns and other materials into them, which makes the bag more personal and thus more attractive.
For example, bags with coloured ribbons or leather bands are especially trendy lately.
The letters of thanks can be sent to actress Jane Birkin, the biggest straw bag fan of whom had never been seen before.
In fact, he matched the straw bag to all sorts of outfits and didn’t even think it would take much to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
The popularity of bags nowadays is not less important, but the fact that taking care of them is a cockhead and unlike all other sumadans, they do not have to be taken care of with special means, but water and a wet towel will do the job.
As with all trends, besides the classic look, brands have come up with all kinds of interpretations.
For example, if you wish, you can buy yourself a straw handkerchief or a tiny shoulder bag.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that a classic straw bag never goes out of fashion, but a straw bag does.
What is a classic shoulder bag?
For centuries, such a straw woven bag, which resembles a basket in its style, is open on the top and has short handles, as well as straw handles, has been considered a classic.

GMB worried about investment in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The union expects the managers of cookie maker McVitie's to confirm long-term production plans at the company's Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has been silent on the future of the investment in the Tollcross site.
The factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, owner of McVitie’s, said they had invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the site over the past few years.
Workers were hired there, and union presidents “are the first to hear” if anything changes in the factory’s operations.
In a letter to the company’s site manager, GMB Scotland approached McVitie’s to “address concerns that the funding will not be used to modernise production lines.”
Drew Duffy, Senior Organiser at GMB, said: “The fact that we are not getting clarity from the site’s CEO on Tollcross’s business needs and future investment plan is a source of deep concern for our members.
Several generations of families have worked here, and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and people from the surrounding area of Glasgow, being an essential pillar for ensuring decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and welfare, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living costs and a chronic decline in production, the east of Glasgow desperately needs a fast-growing productivity company at McVitie.”
A spokesman for Pladis said: “The site manager at Tolcross just received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company is responding directly to him because we value active communication with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting took place in Tollcross between employees and representatives of the GMB, where a number of issues were openly discussed.
We then discussed with the staff that, like any other company operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our activities - and this applies to all our companies and sites - to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years, we have invested over <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the Tollcross site, most of which has gone into production lines and operational improvements.
We fully understand the heritage of Tollcross as a production site, and if there are any changes to the site’s operations, employees and trade union representatives will be the first to know.”
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about approaching Neymar?
La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain does not give up in an attempt to lure Neymar into their ranks, making an offer of <0xC2><0xA3>189 million to buy him out. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago about this record-breaking conquest?
This sensational approach has opened a summer transition window and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break more than double the current world record for over-buying set last season with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for <0xC2><0xA3>89 million.
When the transition is complete, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world, earning over <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 a week from PSG.
Barcelona are known to be angry at both the approach and Neymar’s break-out, although a source close to Catalans’ board of directors says the club has always taken the best care of the player since his arrival in Santos in 2013.
But did the president of PSG warn the world of such an opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in signing Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif sternly warned any club that was considering recruiting some of PSG's best players.
“I don’t worry because they know that if they touch any of our players, we will confront them and contact those players,” said Al-Khelaif.
“We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to make a deal with one of our players, they have to face the consequences.”
Barcelona seem to have crossed that line as the Spanish club showed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratt earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italians to leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could suffer a setback as a result of this interest, losing one of its precious assets in the form of Neymar.
After Brexit, Ireland wants to build bridges, not borders.
"Brexit is seriously threatening to drive a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Britain and Ireland," Varadkar warned on his first visit to Northern Ireland since taking office in June.
“I can’t imagine who would benefit,” he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made the current free movement of people and goods possible, Varadkar said.
“This is our vision for the future: to build bridges, not borders,” he said.
Varadkar said he would prefer Britain to remain a part of the European Union, and since it cannot, he would prefer Britain to remain a part of the European single market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to smooth the way for Britain to leave would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, the Irish Prime Minister explained.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "We could definitely have such an agreement with Great Britain".
The alternative to this would be a return to customs posts, which would herald historic divisions and political failure.
"A barrier to trade, prosperity and peace," he said.
He called Brexit a “challenge for our generation” and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland’s daily life.
The Irish Prime Minister met with the leaders of the main political parties in Northern Ireland during his visit to Belfast.
In his first half-length triathlon, Märt Avandi: Ironman can be completed by anyone.
Today, the biggest triathlon festival in the Baltics was held in the winter capital Otepää, when nearly a thousand triathletes from over thirty countries entered the semi-long Ironman competition.
The 70.3-mile race consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling and 21.1 km of cycling.
Among others, Märt Avandi also won his first triathlon.
“I thought it was going to be difficult, and it was going to be difficult in the end,” Avandi said.
Despite the complexity, Avandi admitted that in fact triathlon is feasible for almost everyone.
"It's not the distance that kills, it's the pace that kills," he said, hinting that at an affordable pace, almost anyone could reach the finish line.
Except for Ott Sepp: "Ott's physique is fine, but unfortunately he can't swim".
Avandi had been training since February.
First 4-5 hours a week, then 10 hours a week.
At 05:34:12, he finished in 270th place overall.
Although Avandi lost to both Raio Piiroja (time 04:59:53) and J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Ligi (time 05:06:37), he won other so-called "prominent class" contestants.
Tanel Padar, who was the "good example person" last year, lost to Avant in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18, respectively).
The overall winner of the Otepää stage in the Ironman series was Johannes Moldan from Germany with a time of 3:58:27, and Ivo Suur with a time of 04:14:09 was the best Estonian.
Among women, Helle Frederiksen from Denmark won with a time of 04:24:01, and among Estonians, Maria Jänese, who lost to Frederiksen in half an hour and got a time of 04:58:58.
He completed a 1.9 km swimming distance in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water in position 410.
