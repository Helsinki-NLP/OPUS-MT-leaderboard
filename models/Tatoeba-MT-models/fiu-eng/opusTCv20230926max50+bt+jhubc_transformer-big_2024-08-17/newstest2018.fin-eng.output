Camille Auer wanted to correct her gender, was diagnosed with mental illness, and now she is making art on the subject - "A person should have the right to his own body"
Dozens of patient stories hang from the roof of the Academy of Fine Arts’ Project room gallery.
Each of them bears the name of Camille Auer.
The papers tell a multi-year story of how outsiders have written down their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
They decided for him who he was.
“I wanted to share my personal medical history to make the violence of the process visible,” Auer says.
She refers to the gender reassignment process.
It is often a period of years of research that includes meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process will begin with a referral to the diagnostics of "gender identity disorder" carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
In the case of Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before this, she had used the estrogen she had ordered over the internet and was already very advanced in her own repair process.
She felt that she was a woman, but under Finnish law, a person has to go through a correction process in order to be able to correct the gender legally as well.
The Trans Act (563/2002) obligates transgender people to undergo forced sterilization in order to obtain the correct gender, for example, in the Population Register Centre and in the passport.
At the moment, every person who corrects their gender requires a psychiatric diagnosis and a certificate of infertility.
A person has the right to control their own body.
"This situation is intolerable and violates human rights," says Auer.
The reform of the Transla law has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has made eight observations on the law, and the European Court of Human Rights has a preliminary ruling obliging the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect the right to self-determination.
The previous Finnish Government prepared the amendment of the Act under the leadership of the then Minister of Social Affairs and Health Susanne Huovinen.
There were elections and the Finns Party took over the government.
Now the law is stuck again.
These are domestic disputes that do not even relate to this law.
“The government does not want to put it on the table because there are disagreements within the government about changing the law,” said Frank Johansson, Executive Director of Amnesty Finland.
The front part of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
One of them consists of the packaging and instructions for use of the medicines used by Auer.
In the patient story installation, any visitor can read, for example, the transpol psychologist’s interpretation of Auer at Tampere University Hospital.
The psychologist met with Camille Auer twice and wrote a report that would define Auer’s right to care and help.
The perception of the reality under study appears prone to faltering.
The self-perception of the subject appears to be fragmented at the border space level, and the unstable features of the personality are highlighted.
Auer did not recognize himself from these descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed with mental illness," Auer says.
It was even more shocking when Auer was denied sex reassignment treatment.
According to the medical staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his own identity.
Then, on February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked off the TV in the waiting room of the Transpol.
Later, a work of art called Monument for the Excluded was created from that television, in which Auer reflected on his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that anyone who is a woman at birth can enlarge their breasts, but to remove them, you need a diagnosis," Auer says.
Your body is not your own if you feel that you are not defined by your gender at birth.
Unfortunately, Auer’s experience is not the only one.
For many, the sex reassignment process is harder for mental reasons than purely medical operations.
Those going through it will meet dozens of people who need to justify their own existence and right to their own sexual experience.
“It’s crazy that people who need support and help are denied treatment on the grounds that they don’t have the resources,” Auer says.
Many of the participants in the process have psychological symptoms behind them: depression, anxiety, possible experiences of bullying.
On the basis of these, the medical staff may order that treatment cannot be started.
“Preventing treatment and getting help can plunge a person into an even worse situation than it was before the process began,” Auer says.
Auer’s own exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition publication, Auer writes: "I have had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life, and that is something that people usually find difficult to digest."
Depression has been treated with medication, and when Auer started using hormones, I felt relieved.
She had finally been able to express feelings that had existed since childhood and adolescence.
Why the broad chin didn’t seem to fit my body and why the chest muscles had to be round instead of flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer has been that there are people around him who can see him.
To be seen is a basic need.
“You have to justify yourself so much by talking, getting dressed, using your voice and moving around,” she says.
Today, Auer feels that she is already visible, that she exists as a woman.
However, in the early stages of the process, random comments from loved ones could hurt a lot.
It hurts the most when people close to you misbehave.
“They should know and they know who I am, but they won’t accept or can’t internalize it,” he continues.
However, not all trans people need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, where the body or its parts can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and a long examination process, you can not get official confirmation of your own sex.
"There is no medical basis for these studies," Auer says.
And it's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014 the parliament approved a new procedure for the recognition of legal gender.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination with regard to legal gender.
An adult applicant submits a written application for a new personal identity code stating that he or she feels that he or she is of the opposite sex.
After a six-month period of reflection, the applicant confirms his/her application in writing and the Ministry gives the applicant a new personal identity code.
This right of self-determination is also required in Finland, and this requirement is also summed up in Auer’s exhibition.
It has not been a therapeutic experience for the artist; the exhibition is a collection of political and artistic works.
I want to believe that art still holds weight and can bring about political change at a time when politicians have forgotten about human rights.

Civil Rights Organization issues travel warning to Missouri
The National Association for African-American Civil Rights (NAACP) has issued a travel alert for Missouri, following discriminatory practices and racist attacks in the state.
“NAACP’s Missouri Travel Notice, effective August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors, and locals to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling in a state that has recently witnessed a number of questionable racial events,” the agency said in a statement.
The recent Missouri law makes it difficult to bring cases of discrimination to court, and enforcement of state laws disproportionately affects minorities. According to the NAACP, these factors led to the issuing of a travel warning.
“People’s civil rights are being violated.
They are stopped for their skin color and beaten or killed,” Rod Chapel, president of the NAACP, told the Kansas City Star.
"We've never heard of so many cases in so short a time."
The Missouri travel bulletin is the organization’s first warning of a U.S. state.
The organization cited racist comments against African-American students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year when he was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel and was arrested by the Missouri police even though he was not charged with a crime.
According to the Missouri Department of Justice, police are 75 percent more likely to stop a black driver than a white one.
“The purpose of the travel bulletin is to urge people to be on their guard and to warn their families, friends, and coworkers about what might be happening in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People need to prepare, for example, by bringing in money to pay bail or telling relatives that they’re going to travel through the state.”
According to the FBI, one hundred hate crimes were recorded in Missouri in 2015, the 16th most in the United States.
The travel alert is also a response to Missouri’s new law, which makes it harder to sue companies for discrimination in housing and employment.
The ACLU recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they passed immigration laws obliging the police to arrest people for immigration offenses. According to the organization, this adds to racial profiling.
Generally, travel warnings are issued by the State Department and apply to other states, but recently they have been issued by NGOs in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for clarification on CEO’s supplementary pension
Minister of Economic Affairs Mika Lintilä (Centre) in charge of state ownership steering has asked Finnair for an explanation of the supplementary pension contribution received by the airline’s CEO Pekka Vauramo, Yle says.
According to the Minister, this is in conflict with the state’s declaration of intent.
Vauramo’s additional pension of EUR 130,000 was highlighted this week when Helsingin Sanomat reported on the remuneration development of directors of listed companies.
Suomen Kuvalehti reported on Vauramo’s supplementary pension in February.
Finnair announced that it will retire from supplementary pensions in 2013.
The Government has stated that supplementary pensions will not be used for remuneration.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year’s shareholder steering resolution.
The sanctions immediately escalated.
Until recently, relations between the United States and Russia seemed to be moving from cold to warm.
US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met at the G20 summit in Hamburg, seemed to get along well.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
Russia reacted bitterly to the new economic sanctions adopted by the US Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday.
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has said the sanctions bill signed by Trump amounts to a “full-scale trade war.”
Even if Russia’s reactions were only political rhetorical aggravations and excesses, the tightening of relations between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon period after Trump’s election.
In the United States, sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea were not easy to pass.
The Congress passed the law unanimously, but it was much more difficult for the President to pass the law.
Trump called the bill “significantly flawed.”
The reason for President Trump’s strutting may have been Russia in particular, although the passing of a law restricting one’s own powers must also have been repugnant.
As is well known, the United States is investigating both possible Russian interference in the presidential election and the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia.
Tensions between the United States and Russia are a fact after a short honeymoon.
As the White House staff has changed frequently and various scandalous developments have been revealed, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy in the United States is not conducted under the leadership of the President, but in spite of the President.
Such a situation is by no means desirable.
If the relationship with Russia is complicated in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the EU's core region, the Baltic Sea, is tightening relations.
The EU has visibly highlighted the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained, at least on the face of it, united in its policy towards Russia, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a member country like Finland that trades a lot with Russia, economic sanctions have been a real nuisance.
The effects of the recent US sanctions are still unclear.
The EU has feared that sanctions will make it more difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, the effects may be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in Fennovoima’s nuclear power plant project.
The acidity in Europe has been caused by the exclusion from the sanctions of LNG, which is important for the US economy, for example.
Trade sanctions are a means of expressing disapproval in world politics.
However, economic sanctions must be well thought out and carefully controlled.
Otherwise, they will easily do more harm than good.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump’s White House now has the Statue of Liberty in its sights
Interference with statues is the surest sign of a change of power.
The Americans know this as well as anyone else: the Iraqis, together with American soldiers, demolished a statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideologues of the Trump administration, was well aware of what was being done in the heated debate with CNN’s Jim Acosta. The Statue of Liberty was attacked by Miller in a spat about the president’s proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller didn't exactly criticize the statue itself.
Had he done so, he would have been attacked by huge hordes of cruise organizers and figures imitating the Statue of Liberty.
His attack was on the significance of the statue and, in 1903, the poem by Emma Lazarus was added to the base of the statue – 17 years after the statue was completed.
This is how Miller chided Acosta: "I don't want to go into history now, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the whole world.
The poem was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller himself was not wrong, but it is not just history, as he himself said.
The words of Lazarus are the only ones of their kind in which the state calls not only the immigrants but the "poorest of the poor": "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wreathed rebuke of your teaming shore."
The poem is now more relevant than ever.
Miller made it clear that the "poorest of the poor" are not welcome in Trump's United States.
The controversy over the importance of the Statue of Liberty is part of a broader political and cultural controversy over the importance of the United States.
After his death, Lazarus’ friends campaigned to have the poem fastened to the base of the statue, knowing full well that it was a strongly political act.
The purpose of the statue was to express the connections between French and American republicanism through the classical symbol, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the exiles.
Attaching the poem to the image was an ingenious feminist coup d'état and a devastating attack on the American nationalist ideal.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to change it back to the original.
Rush Limbaugh – a mouthpiece that can now be seen as some sort of harbinger of Trump – claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not an invitation to anyone, but is an early pioneer of neoconservatives who take the torch of the United States to a world covered in darkness: “Lady Liberty steps forward.
He takes the freedom of the torch from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch does not point the way to the United States."
Rarely, Limbaugh was partially right.
The significance of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on perspective.
Lazarus saw it as the poor and weary but hopeful immigrants from the deck of a ship after a long and trying journey.
He saw it from the perspective of people looking for shelter and a better life.
His Statue of Liberty comforts us by giving hope and welcoming us.
That’s not what Miller and Trump want.
Their torch does not point the way, but kindles the flames of hatred, their only source of strength.
World Championships in Athletics 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of UK national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots made it to the UK national team
The UK Athletics Federation’s results director Neil Black says the 16 Scottish members of the national team taking part in the World Championships are a “significant confirmation”.
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Championships in Athletics, which will start in London on Friday.
According to Black, "something special is happening in Scotland" that British track and field athletes need to learn from.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to study it until we understand what it is all about," Black says.
"I spoke to representatives of the Scottish Institute for Sport and they thought it was related to the Institute's activities.
The Scottish Athletics Federation, on the other hand, believes it will join the league's activities,
and the British Athletics Federation believes that their activities are behind it.
And an ordinary streetwalker thinks he must have something to do with it.
But it’s a great thing, whatever it is.”
Many Scottish athletes in London are serious about medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000 metres, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen as captain of the national team.
"Eilidh is too modest.
His speech to the captain was unbelievably stunning,” Black said.
"The athletes left the event proud of their achievements and strongly motivated, regardless of where they happen to live and train.
Eilidh’s words had a genuine feeling and passion for the sport.”
Eilidh Doyle is the Commonwealth Games silver medalist in the 400m hurdles, and this is his fifth World Cup. He finds it "incredible" that there are 16 Scots in the national team.
The previous record was seven in 1983 and 2015.
Middle distance runner Laura Muir has set five UK and two European records in the past year.
He competes in London at 1,500 metres and 5,000 metres.
Chris O’Hare runs the 1,500 metres in London, and he’s another one to keep an eye on: he’s got a great season behind him, with wins in the UK World Cup qualifiers and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup when the only Scotsman on the national team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he is "hugely proud" to have so many Scots on board, some of whom are serious about competing for the finals and medals.
“It’s a great honor to be captain, but it’s even more special because the national team voted for the captain,” Doyle said.
"I'm very proud of all the Scottish players who made it to the national team.
It shows how far we have come.
They are involved as distinguished athletes competing for the award.
My captain's speech?
I think it went just fine.
I focused on how lucky we are to have home games.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home crowd and that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to compete there and I know the atmosphere will be amazing."
Blocking reviewers on Facebook: Don’t run for public office if you can’t stand criticism
The father of our country knew what bad publicity was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but newspapers soon began to criticize him for everything from possible domestic politics to his political principles.
Criticism is annoying,
But he did not silence his critics.
“If freedom of speech is taken away, we may be led dumb and silent as sheep to the slaughter,” Washington said in 1783.
Which brings us to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan’s staff has removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked those who posted them.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Union sued Hogan earlier this week.
His staff consider the challenge unfounded, and the attitude was also belittling online.
"What does it matter? This is just Facebook," many commenters said.
But it does matter,
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is the surprisingly popular Republican governor of a Democratic-controlled state.
He has received the second highest rating among the 50 governors.
Hogan's not very responsive to hotheads.
He has led the state firmly and has stood firm on principles.
He has also skillfully used Facebook as the main channel of communication with his voters and published there a picture of a balding head in chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking users from coming to the governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The governor's page is a public and official forum, which is maintained by his staff with tax funds.
Hogan's spokesman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions in an interview with the Washington Post, saying it was just a matter of moderation.
However, labeling commenters as trolls, spammers or haters is too easy a solution.
The Washington Post interviewed users blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to leaders of their choice; they were not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, for example.
They reported that their comments were respectful, considerate, and businesslike.
In his comment, the pastor quoted the Bible; he wanted to appeal to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Maryland, was not hostile but asked a question about hate crimes.
“I politely commented that I was disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news,” he wrote in a Washington Post commentary.
"I also cannot accept that when more people comment on the same issue, they are immediately seen as a sort of organised group, and that a large group of concerned citizens is ignored."
The governor's staff called the comments a "concentrated attack." Someone else might call them to advance matters of importance.
In the age of Facebook, it’s easy to manage communication by blocking a reviewer or deleting a critical comment.
In the old days, we should have sent staff to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
It’s the same thing, only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be charged with shackling Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users blocked by President Trump have sued him.
The first major decision was made in Virginia last week.
Alexandria District Judge James C. Cacheris said the Loudoun County government violated the First Amendment by blocking voters on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Liberties Union went to discuss the use of Twitter and Facebook with Kentucky Republican Governor Matt Bevin.
This shouldn't be difficult.
In the time of Washington, low postage had an effect similar to that of the Internet today.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and Washington was hammered by anonymous writers.
There were trolls then.
The pseudonyms Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius wrote letters in the newspapers defaming Washington's decisions.
The President’s office was flooded with petitions criticising the Jay Agreement, a cooperation, trade and shipping agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom, as evidenced by documents collected by the Papers of George Washington online project.
But he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the cornerstones of our nation.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
The summer feeding of birds should be stopped immediately
Samples have come from about half a dozen places, and also online notifications from two or three.
Most of them have come from Southern and Southwest Finland, but also from Haapavesi and Seinäjoki, says Senior Scientist Marja Isomursu from Evira.
Green finches have died from a parasitic disease called trichomoniasis.
It is caused by a protozoa called Trichomonas gallinae.
In the past, it has been known to strike pigeons, especially the poodle.
However, in the 21st century, the disease was also observed in finches.
In 2009 it hit hard.
At that time, trichomoniasis caused a big collapse in the Finnish greenfinch population, after which the population of the species has been recovering.
There have now been sick green finches, but at least not yet on a large scale, says Juha Honkala, Museum Master at the University of Helsinki’s Central Museum of Natural Sciences (Luomus).
It is feared that the previous epidemic of green finches will reoccur if nothing is done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that anyone can do: stop summer feeding birds immediately.
More on that later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home court advantage at Renaissance Club
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from the home field advantage over the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Rafferty, from Northern Ireland, led the Archerfield Links tournament next door last year before the final round, but lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty is keen on the new location and will serve as the tournament ambassador on behalf of the club’s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event it will reach its full glory,” Rafferty says.
"Players see the field at its best. It's in great shape.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He's an avid ambassador for the game, and he's proud of what he's done here.
The tournament is a great introduction to this field."
England’s Eales defends the title for the first time, despite winning both a European tour and a European challenger tour in his 32-year career.
“This feels like a really special opportunity,” said the Southport-based player.
"I was unable to defend my win at the Extremadura Open because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It's great to be back.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year’s memories come back to mind: winning the tournament was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a wonderful time that we will always remember.”
Gary Orr is back in action on his own soil, and he joined the tour after turning 50 earlier this year.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
“Playing at home is always more meaningful than usual,” says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
“You want to succeed, but you also feel the extra pressure.
I’ve enjoyed playing again and I’ve been playing pretty hard.
I’m happy with my game so far.”
The trio will be joined on the pitch by former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Six Scots will participate in the tournament: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance, as well as Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Possible indoor air problems at the barracks were investigated in Säkylä
In Säkylä, no indoor air problems have been found in the barracks of the Pori Brigade Signal Company, at least so far, the brigade was told on Thursday.
The indoor air surveys will continue.
The investigation began when a man who had interrupted his military service for health reasons suspected that his health had deteriorated due to poor indoor air in the barracks.
According to Lieutenant Colonel Mika Holma, Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, no problems have been detected in the health situation of other conscripts.
It turned out that this was an isolated case and that the others who served in that service had no health problems.
Every notification is taken seriously and we wanted to look into this in depth.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any indoor air problems, Holma says.
The brigade's statement says that the arrival in July has forced goods to be moved to the barracks, which may have caused a temporary increase in dustiness.
The air may therefore have seemed stagnant, Holma says.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Land of Gold
Bardina Degei does not use a stove in cooking.
He rarely uses a pot, too.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai region, located in the troubled province of Papua, Indonesia. When he cooks dinner, he usually puts the sweet potato – locally “nota” – directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred sweet potato is eaten greedily with bare, unwashed hands.
There is no furniture in Degei’s home, and he sits on a muddy earth floor, where he usually does his daily chores, such as washing his clothes in the muddy water from a nearby swamp.
There is a bucket in the ceiling-free room.
Degei is the youngest of her husband’s four wives, and she is not assigned to tend the fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed, and many are drinking heavily.
"No one dares to walk in the village after five in the evening," Degei says.
This is a rare glimpse into everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed by Indonesia in 1969, following a controversial referendum in which 1,026 village elders were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed Dutch rule, quickly turned its anger on the Jakarta government, which is tightly controlling the region and blocking access to foreign journalists and human rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
The journey to Enarotal starts with an hour-and-a-half flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and continues with a stomach-wrenching five-hour drive in a rental car.
There is no public transport here.
With a population of about 19,000, the city has wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, with corrugated roofs stained with yellowish brown by rust.
Few Indonesians have ever been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the advent of the Christian missionaries, the Papuan Mee Pago tribesmen worshiped the god Uga Tamee.
Other changes have taken place.
“We didn’t have clothes like this,” Degei says. He means his colorful, hand-woven wrap-up headdress, dark skirt, and brightly colored blouse.
“Before, we only had leaves to cover our bodies.”
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line, and one of the highest rates of child mortality and illiteracy in Asia.
But it is also the gold of Indonesia.
Paniai is a highland area about the size of New Jersey with a population of 153,000. Just about 100 kilometers from Paniai is Grasberg, the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world. It is owned by the Freeport McMoran company, headquartered in Phoenix, USA.
In 2015, the mine generated $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion in wood reserves.
For the Papuans, however, these riches bring misery, as they mean the suffocating presence of a strong Indonesian army.
The New York Times reported in 2005 that Freeport paid local military personnel and local units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004.
Papua's demands for greater self-determination threaten this source of income and are mercilessly silenced.
According to human rights activists, since 1969, the Indonesian army has killed more than 500,000 Papuans and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the massacres in the highlands of the Papuan tribes in the 1970s amounted to genocide.
Last year, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 people in the area during peaceful demonstrations.
The Brisbane Archdiocese’s 2016 We Will Lose Everything report includes reports of last year’s atrocities, including extrajudicial executions, torture – rape and electric shocks are particularly popular means – and relentless attacks on peaceful protests.
“Calculating the number of victims is difficult because there are cases every week,” said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher with Human Rights Watch.
The screw has been tightened as Papua’s natural resources attract migrants from elsewhere in Indonesia.
Eighty-three percent of the province’s 3.5 million inhabitants are Christian, but the population is changing as Indonesia’s populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi migrate to the region in search of a better livelihood for Muslims.
Javanese warung food stalls sell fried chicken and gado-gado-vegetable mix in peanut sauce.
Locals find it hard to compete.
"The movers have started selling chicken and vegetables at the market for less than the locals," said Abeth You, a 24-year-old from Paniai who moved to the provincial capital for work.
"Local women lost their customers."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo – nicknamed Jokowi – promised in his 2014 election campaign to address Papua’s injustices and human rights violations.
Papua is made up of 29 regions, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 regions, including Pania, on his way to Jakarta’s Presidential Palace.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokow in 2014 and expected him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice," You said.
Panic was felt only two months after Jokow’s October inauguration.
Eleven children were singing Christmas carols by a campfire in Enarotal on 7 December 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared from the dark on motorcycles.
The frightened children told the soldiers that they should use the headlights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to the accounts of the victims and the Witnesses, drunken soldiers took the children and beat them with rifle butts.
So one of the soldiers shot at the children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of the assault.
A few hours later, the building of the State Electoral Commission near the scene was set on fire, and the next day began to happen.
About a thousand Papuans —young men, women, and children— gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and army command center to demand justice.
With hunting bows for festive occasions, they began to perform the traditional waita dance of the Papuan Mee Pago tribe, dancing in a circle and imitating bird song.
Some protesters began to stone police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere heated up, the soldiers received an order on the internal radio system: "If the masses of people resist more than three times, shoot them to death." The information is based on an official document seen by TIME magazine, which has not been disclosed to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the resident leader of the Kego Koto area, foresaw the situation getting out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
“When I turned around, I was shot in the left wrist,” he told TIME magazine on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who shot him, but the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers.
"Several shots were fired in the crowd."
Alfius Youw was shot three times, and his cousin witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and made sure it was him," Yohanes told TIME magazine sadly. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papuan police superintendent Yotje Mende told reporters that police officers were only “protecting” the police station because it was under attack.
"We need to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Pudjo Sulistiyo, a Papuan police spokesman, said in 2015.
"Then it's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The news of his death reached Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapura in which he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised that the violence in Papua would be addressed.
"I want the case investigated immediately so that nothing like this will ever happen again."
In October 2016, Security Minister Wiranto said he would launch investigations into human rights violations outside the justice system.
He immediately began to recant his words.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the violations, but it requires certain processes to do so," he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind and said that he had no intention of starting investigations in Papua.
“Everything will be settled in court,” he said.
The UN accuses Wiranto of "crimes against humanity". The crimes are related to the death of more than a thousand people in East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999. Wiranto told TIME magazine that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been investigated, including the events in Paniai.
The families of the victims of Paniai are grimly disbelieving in the allegations.
“I’ve been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things haven’t progressed in any way,” Yohanes says.
"I'm already tired of this."
He says he’s still living in fear, even though it’s been years.
"Yes, I am," he said.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panians do not dare to discuss the event.
He says he was beaten by soldiers after helping to bury four of the victims.
“The soldiers are looking for me after the victims are buried,” he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot dead villagers in Deiyai, a suburb of Paniai.
One person was killed and 17 were injured in a conflict between villagers and the construction company’s manager, who refused to take the unconscious man to the hospital, including children.
The man who needed hospital care was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been drowned while fishing in a nearby river and died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers demonstrated at a construction site in front of the company’s office.
Police said the villagers stoned police officers who responded with warning shots.
According to locals, however, a mobile police unit of the Indonesian paramilitary police opened fire on the crowd, killing one villager.
"We are terrified. We are afraid of revenge," says 29-year-old Domingogu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being brought to treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Deiyai parliament has called for the police officers who fired shots to be held accountable and for the mobile police unit to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of real development is fuelling dissatisfaction among the Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal tribes who live in the lush central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), an army of rebels that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans through random attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of the directors of OPM are Paniaista, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded by arbitrarily arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Pania in the name of 'safeguarding national sovereignty'.
Some of the detainees never return.
Among the Papuans, Paniai is known as the "sad, forgotten place".
Poverty breeds discontent.
There's very little rice for sale in Enarotal, and it's too expensive for the locals.
as well as bread.
People grow their own food: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Cultivation is the work of women, and one woman may be responsible for four or five sweet potato fields.
Most of the harvest is for the family, and the rest is sold at the market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the differences in income between locals and migrants have widened, and the number of migrants has increased since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
Jobs are scarce and tend to go to better educated and more affluent migrants locally.
Only a few Papuans have enough capital and know-how to run their own company competitively.
“Young people don’t want to stay in the village because there’s no work and no money,” said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
In the world, remote Papua is not given much attention.
In addition, restrictions on international reporting remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua, despite being granted a rare permission to photograph, due to an official inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Director for Asia at Human Rights Watch, Jokowi has not kept his election promises, has not increased transparency and has not contributed to development by removing restrictions on the media.
“Reporters from Indonesia’s turbulent easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua face new risks: visa denial and blacklisting,” Kine said in a statement.
The lack of press freedom means that the Indonesian Government is only under pressure from Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific nations — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands — urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate Papua’s “numerous and widespread violations,” including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have also traditionally supported the Papuan liberation movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Armanatha Nasir denied the allegations and told reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations."
The locals want foreign governments to intervene.
When an official Dutch delegation, led by Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Bar, visited Jayapura on 4 May 2017, the locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, according to an anonymous source who attended the meeting.
Indonesia will hold presidential elections in 2019, but Papuans say they are no longer likely to vote for Jokow.
“Jokowi means well, but there are people around him who are involved in Paniai’s shooting scene,” said Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokow to know about the situation of the Panians: they live under the rule of a greedy and unpredictable army, in want and poverty, practically without health care and education.
According to Gobai, the Panians, like other Papuans, consider the votes they cast for Jokowi as a "debt" that must be repaid.
“They don’t want money. They just want justice,” he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the relatives of the victims of the Paniai shooting demonstrated yet again their symbolic resistance: they buried one of the victims on the ground opposite the police station and the army headquarters.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed," Yacobus said with his head bowed.
"What else can we do?"
Dereck Chisora says Robert Helenius' rematch is cancelled: "Even his own fans don't want to see it"
Heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora were scheduled to fight on May 27 at the Hartwall Arena.
The match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora blames Helenius for the failure of the rematch.
My match in Finland flopped, but it wasn’t my fault.
I don’t live in Finland, I don’t want to sell tickets there.
It was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don’t want to see him fight, because he’s miserable.
Helenius and Chisora first met in full Hartwall Arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial penalty point.
Ticket sales for the rematch went smoothly, and its promoter, Nisse Sauerland, told Ilta-Sanomat in May that the match had been postponed until the autumn.
Nothing new has been heard from the match since.
However, the cancellation no longer bothers Chisora.
The match would probably have had to be cancelled in any case, given that Chisora was ill.
On Thursday, three days before the game, I woke up in severe pain.
My hernia was about to explode.
The hospital said I had to be operated on, Chisora says.
The UK is currently at about 45%.
Apparently, he's not interested in a rematch with Helenius, but he's looking for Dillian Whyte.
Chisora was defeated by Whyte in December.
Fire strikes again at Torch Tower in Dubai
The flames took over one of the world’s tallest residential buildings in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter-high 79-story building.
This was the second fire in two years in a building that happens to be called the Torch.
The building was evacuated, and no one is known to have been injured.
“We were asleep and woke up to the sound of the fire alarm and the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took about ten minutes,” a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai’s fire brigade said it was able to extinguish the fire at 4 a.m. local time and stayed to cool the building.
The Government announced that it would provide accommodation for those who have left home.
The case may raise new questions about the safety of materials used on the exteriors of tall buildings around the world.
After the fire in 2015, the Torch building’s board of directors commissioned a study that found that the most damaged were the panels used for cladding and insulation of the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade.
In Britain, police believe the insulation and cladding of London’s Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of the flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in Joensuu during the night
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in Joensuu between 9 p.m. on Tuesday and 5 a.m. on Wednesday.
The moped disappeared from Niinivaara at Tikkamäentie 2.
The Moped was called Sky Team Monkey.
It is red in color and the registration number is 27-REV.
The car was found later on Thursday.
The police will request observations about the moped or its theft by e-mail to This email address is being protected from spambots.

On August 3, 2017, at 12:40 p.m., police reported that a moped had been found.
In the United States, more than 20 percent of air passengers carry prohibited items on board, according to a survey.
A survey of air passengers reveals that more than 20 percent of passengers in the United States had knowingly or unknowingly carried prohibited articles on board aircraft past U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (TSA) checkpoints. At least 6 percent of passengers had knives or other bladed items that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than one per cent said they only learned afterwards that they had been transporting weapons, ammunition or explosives by mistake.
More than a thousand passengers responded to the survey, carried out by Stratos Jet Charters. The results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to defy the rules.
Of the passengers who knowingly violated TSA regulations, 19.7% were Generation Y passengers and less than 15% were Generation X passengers.
The most common way to break the rules was to take food and liquids on board.
More than three per cent admitted to knowingly taking bladed items on board, while 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men said they had knowingly taken prohibited drugs on board.
The survey surveyed passengers from all over the United States, and the company wanted to find out how many people had inadvertently taken contraband items past a security check and how many had done so knowingly.
Unsurprisingly, most travelers are also more likely to take contraband items past security – knowingly or unknowingly.
But as the company that conducted the survey notes, TSA’s guidelines are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know which liquids can be taken on board and how much.
So it's no surprise that the majority of TSA seizures are liquids.
For a while there was also a belief that books should not be taken on a plane.
Liquids may be taken on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt reversed his decision to delay Obama administration decisions to cut emissions
The day after 15 states sued EPA Director Scott Pruitt, Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay the Obama administration’s decisions to reduce smog emissions.
According to Pruitt, the change shows that the agency he heads is more responsive than previous administrations to the needs of environmental decision-makers in the Länder.
Pruitt did not say a word about the lawsuit that had been filed against her earlier decision in a federal appeals court.
States should start complying with the 2015 ground-level ozone standard as of 1 October.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the implementation of the decisions for a year so that his agency would have more time to familiarise itself with the plan, as the agency "does not want to interfere with local decision-making or hinder economic growth."
Pruitt was the attorney general of Oklahoma before being appointed by President Donald Trump as the head of the EPA. Pruitt is known for opposing stricter environmental regulations.
Since coming to Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to block or delay the implementation of decisions opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday’s sudden change of heart is the latest setback to Pruitt’s plan to relax regulations.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., ruled that the EPA executive exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay the Obama administration’s decision on oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement Wednesday night, Pruitt argued that his U-turn on ozone regulations would only strengthen EPA’s cooperation with the states in a complex process to meet the new requirements on schedule.
"During past administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and then waited for activist groups and others to sue it for reaching an agreement on schedules," Pruitt said.
“We don’t believe in regulation through trials and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation of our activities and the powers it confers on us."
However, the EPA said Pruitt could continue to use its "powers to delay the enforcement of decisions and other legal powers" to "ensure that the provisions are well-founded and based on the best available information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader change in ozone regulations.
The bill, which was passed last month, aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 resolutions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the EPA’s lawsuit this week, said the group will continue to exert pressure.
“The EPA’s change of heart as a result of our lawsuits is a significant victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans exposed to the direct effects of smog in their communities,” Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the lawsuit involved California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia.
Ground level ozone is created when emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants, for example, react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause severe breathing difficulties for sensitised groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists welcomed Pruitt’s surprising change of direction.
“It’s worrisome how much pressure was put on the guy in charge of our breathing air to use common sense,” says Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to fight the Trump administration because its ideological goal is to act on the terms of polluters and other self-serving groups.”
Supercar manufacturer makes SUV - "happens in Ferrari style"
It also plans to invest in hybrid sports cars while maintaining its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will happen in Ferrari style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said at a news conference on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer presents its new five-year plan, Automotive News reported.
All East Savo measles cases of the same virus type
The measles infection in Rantasalmi is of the same virus type as the previous cases in Eastern Savo, the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) reports.
The Laboratory of Virology of the National Institute for Health and Welfare has confirmed on Thursday that the fifth measles infection in Eastern Savo is the same strain as previous infections.
The National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) has confirmed that the measles infection confirmed on Friday 28 July in a person living in Rantasalmi is of the same virus type as the previous cases in Eastern Savo.
On the basis of this information, all the infections detected in Eastern Savo are related to the first case of measles detected in the region in June.
The news is good, because it means that we have not discovered any other types of measles virus.
However, it is possible that new infections may emerge from the fifth person until mid-August, and the epidemic is therefore not yet over,” says Dr Mirkaleena Erkkilä, who is responsible for communicable diseases in Soster’s primary health care.
No new cases or suspicions of measles have emerged since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important for everyone to ensure that their vaccination coverage is up-to-date,” Erkkilä points out.
Three new measles infections confirmed in Pirkanmaa - "Additional infections or epidemic very unlikely"
Finland is preparing for a permitted scream
The Pontica soup was not even considered for legalization.
The underlying argument is that the process produces, in addition to alcohol, methanol, which is toxic.
Making a scream at home will be legal next year, but the legalization of moonshine soup is not even under consideration.
The scream is made by fermentation, the moonshine by distillation.
The rationale behind the regulation of distillation is that the process produces, in addition to alcohol, methanol, which is toxic.
There has been no political will to make the soup of the moonshine an everyman’s right,” says Ismo Tuominen, Senior Ministerial Adviser at the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the ministry was preparing the reform of the Alcohol Act, the distillation of moonshine was not considered for legalization.
Nor was it brought to the political table.
There was no discussion on the liberalisation of distillation, says Member of Parliament Outi Mäkelä (ECR).
He is a member of the parliamentary groups of the government parties, which took a position on the reform of the Alcohol Act.
Permission to distill moonshine at home cannot be granted even on application in the future.
Commercial production will also remain subject to authorisation.
Tuominen explains that there is a simple rule for making alcoholic beverages at home: alcohol can be made at home by fermentation.
This means that now, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can also legally make screams at home.
The Government wanted to simplify the regulations.
The new Act removes the requirements for flavours and flavourings and enables the production of snuff, Mäkelä specifies.
The preparation must still be carried out in such a way that the raw materials or the flavours and flavourings resulting from their fermentation are clearly visible in the drink.
Under the new law, you can make as many drinks as you want, and you can give home-made alcohol as a gift.
It is not allowed to sell it.
The act of screaming is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
A much bigger change took place in 2004 when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were liberalised.
75% of the alcohol consumed in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The Alcohol Act is now under review by the Ministry of Justice.
The Alcohol Act will be submitted to Parliament as soon as the autumn season begins.
The session was held on 5.9.
The Act will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if the Parliament had already taken a position, Mäkelä rejoices.
Oscar Pistorius rushed to hospital with armed guards
Oscar Pistorius was rushed to a South African hospital after suffering a heart attack.
Pistorius is out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving a prison sentence in Atteridgeville.
According to the British newspaper Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison to the hospital this morning under the escort of armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pains, but he was released from the hospital in the afternoon.
A prison spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for examination.
A spokesman for the Pistorius family said the former top athlete was fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced a six-time Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Recorded phone calls reveal Trump pressured Mexico to build border wall
The transcripts of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have leaked to the Washington Post.
In a phone call on January 27, 2017, Trump urged Mexican President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto to stop making public statements about not paying for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States reproached Nieto for knocking out the wall project in public. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the U.S. southern border at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also released a transcript of Trump’s first phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, during which there was a tense exchange of words.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take in refugees on their way to Australia is "ridiculous", "pathetic" and "stupid". Trump said the agreement negotiated during Obama's presidency would make him look like a "idiot" because he had proposed a ban on refugees settling in the United States.
Trump ended the call by telling Turnbull that “this was the most unpleasant call of the day.”
Georgia Massacre: Activists Reframe Racist Lynching in Hope of Justice
A Ford Mercury-branded car passes a crowd in the small town of Monroe in rural Georgia and continues its journey towards the small Moore’s Ford Bridge.
There are four black passengers and a white driver, and four armed men block the road before the car reaches the bridge.
A middle-aged man in a striped suit takes a deep breath from his cigar and squints through the windshield.
The passengers are scared.
"Roger, n---u!" the man gasps.
"Get out of the car!"
The screams break the silence as a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is only a re-enactment, which was staged on July 22, 2017.
However, the sighs of shock are genuine when a noose is placed around the neck of "Roger".
Since 2005, human rights groups have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to re-enact the events of 1946, when two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey, were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan.
No one has been charged with the murders.
“It’s puzzling that no one has been arrested in all these years — even though the murderers live among us and many need to know who they are,” said Tyrone Brooks, who is helping with the rearrangement.
“It is a stain on history, but above all it is a burden that weighs on our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgia Congressman.
For him, the re-enactment is a startling call to action, as well as a reminder to the people of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want the perpetrators to be brought to justice; we want things to be brought to an end and we want to recover from the grief and make peace, but most of all we want justice," said Brooks.
"We can't recover and make peace until we get justice."
The coroner covers the body of the victim of the massacre in Georgia on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI documents obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected of being lynched.
No one was charged with murder.
While the culprits have been at large for decades, activists say the motives for lynching have always been known to the locals: politics and sex.
In 1946, blacks in the state of Georgia were allowed by the Supreme Court to vote for the first time in presidential elections. The Supreme Court issued its decision in April, and elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, there was an incident around the time of the election when Roger Malcolm, a black tenant farmer, stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, in a fight that apparently involved Malcom's wife, Dorothy.
According to Brooks, there were rumors in town that Hester was having an affair with Dorothy and that she was expecting a child.
According to FBI records, on July 25, 1946, the influential white landowner Loy Harrison paid Malcom $600 in bail, against which he was released from prison.
On the way home, Malcom and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
A crowd of people stopped their car before Moore's Ford Bridge.
"It turns out that Harrison ordered and orchestrated the murders," the FBI said in a statement.
"It is also apparent that there was a conspiracy between state and local authorities who were involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks puts it more succinctly.
"It was a vote-right murder," he said.
“They were murdered because they wanted to send a message to black people that the same thing would happen to them if they were to vote.”
Cassandra Greene has been directing the re-enactment of the Georgia massacre for nearly a decade.
It is extremely realistic and arresting, and it is a depiction of the shocking racism that many would like to believe has already disappeared from the United States of America today.
It’s hard to watch, but it’s even harder not to watch, which Greene thinks is the point.
“We don’t want to talk about lynching because we would have to face our own dark sides,” the director says.
“But I can’t create a relationship with you if you can’t hear me or don’t want to hear what I’ve been through.”
The rehearsals for this year’s performance began in June. On the first day, about 30 actors – about a dozen blacks and about 20 whites – gathered to listen to Greene’s routine summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's assistant director.
He has played the local leader of the Ku Klux Klan in the reenactment for years, but the role is always as difficult and repugnant.
“I feel dirty because I’m not myself,” Marbaugh said.
"But it is important that this side of history is kept alive so that it will never happen again."
Across the room are Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, aka Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester.
The show begins with a scene in which Malcolm screams and pushes Hester, who is furious that Hester has been having an affair with Dorothy.
"Didn't you hear? I said, get off my land, n---u!"
Rascona, or Hester, answers.
And then there's the punch.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) burst out laughing.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally hit you too hard?" he asks.
"No," Greene gasps.
"I just don't think white people used the word 'n' at the time."
"Yes," another black actor confirmed.
"It's slang. You'll have to use a longer version."
The subject of the performance is unpleasant, but the room is occupied by a spirit of friendship.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just for the sake of the show, but to honor the memory of those who were killed.
The scene starts all over again.
And now Rascona's words pierce me.
No one's laughing.
The re-enactment ends quickly and violently.
Screams, shots, and silence.
A woman in a black funeral suit stands beside the bodies and sings Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit.
His voice is shattered at every word.
A few tens of meters away, about fifty spectators wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
Almost half of the population is black and half is white.
Among them is a couple who have come to see a show in Ithaca, New York, but most of them are locals.
Under Brooks’ guidance, they have visited the victims’ graves in Georgia’s oppressive humidity.
The murders have gone from story to reality, and the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the performance, Greene invites the crowd to inspect the bodies.
The children squat down to look at the fake blood and still bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy muttered, as if to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
The actors who played the lynchings took off their capes and wiped away tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man who played the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then bursts into tears after a tough performance.
"Don't worry," said the woman, comforting her.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason.”
Later, the audience and the actors gather for a joint dinner.
A white couple from Alta is having a lively discussion with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski has a hard time finding words when she describes the emotions that the performance evokes.
“It’s hard to listen to the horrible words and watch the horrible deeds that people say and do who look just like you — precisely because they look just like you,” she says.
“The performance made me realize that lynchings are still happening,” he added. “They’re just called arrests.”
Across the room, Brooks recalls the evolution of civil rights for listeners sitting at the same table.
He said he has already started planning for next year’s show.
“The reenactment is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we’ve experienced, but it’s also an educational experience,” Brooks says.
“Its message is that this can happen again if we don’t learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it.”
Plant-grabbing in the shops: This much by removing the "extra parts" actually saves
Is it permissible to remove the leaves of cauliflower already in the store before weighing?
How about taking off the big hat from the pineapple - it weighs a lot?
The responses are strongly divided: for some, it is an indication of extreme exhaustion, while others do not want to pay for the parts of vegetables that are not used and yet go home to the trash.
This phenomenon can be found in shops.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the K-Citymarket vegetable department in Ruoholahti, Helsinki, because many people tear off the leaf parts of the cauliflower, for example.
From the box, the leaves are taken to the store’s biowaste.
According to a report published by the Financial Times, shopkeepers are puzzled by snorting at the vegetable counter.
But how much does removing excess parts of vegetables before weighing really save money?
How important is this really a scolding device?
Me Naiset tested how the price changes when you take leaves or stems from pineapple, Jerusalem artichokes, mushrooms, broccoli and cauliflower.
Cauliflower: A cauliflower cost 2.10 euros and cost 1.80 euros.
Pineapple: The price of a whole pineapple costing 2.30 euros fell to 1.95 euros when its stock was twisted away.
Top artichoke: 2.60 euros became 2.40 euros when the short stem was cut off.
Mushrooms: Two mushrooms cost 75 cents in total.
Without the stumps, the price was 60 cents.
Broccoli: A medium-sized broccoli cost 1 euro and without the strain 80 cents.
The end result: If you start plucking leaves and stems, you can save at best a few tens of centimetres for one vegetable.
In percentage terms, the price of vegetables fell by up to 20 per cent.
This would have saved you a total of $1.20!
Neymar bought out of Barcelona after signing a five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with French football club PSG.
Earlier on Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar’s agents had paid FC Barcelona, which plays in the Spanish league, a buyout price of 222 million euros.
The transfer of 222 million euros is the biggest in football history.
The record was previously held by Manchester United, which last summer paid 105 million euros for Frenchman Paul Pogba.
The Spanish league put a brake on the move earlier on Thursday when it rejected Neymar’s first payment attempt.
According to the rules of the league, the buying club cannot pay the buyout price directly to the seller, but the player has to buy out his contract himself, which is done by recycling money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and his agents, who provided the money to Barcelona through the league.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will probably be introduced to a new home crowd at the PSG season opening against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa is looking into the details.
In addition, Barcelona said in a statement that it would provide information on the fee to the European Football Association (UEFA) in order to enable it to determine any disciplinary measures that might follow from the case.
Spanish league chairman Javier Tebas has accused PSG of violating UEFA's financial fair play rules.
UEFA could sanction a club that will lose more than €30 million over three years.
According to UEFA, Neymar’s transfer does not automatically violate its economic clauses.
Neymar’s transfer to PSG will have an impact on the club’s finances for several years, but the impact cannot be estimated in advance.
For example, PSG may sell a number of players for substantial amounts of money.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by former Qatari professional tennis player Nasser al-Khelaifi.

Austin, 21, was severely burned by a lightning strike, which was recorded on a security camera at the airport.
Austin Dunn was doing his usual work for a plane at Southwest Florida International Airport with a couple of co-workers when suddenly a flash of lightning from a rainy sky hit the plane.
The force of lightning threw the plane to the ground near the wing of Dunn.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
My father called me and said that my brother was electrocuted and is in the hospital.
I just asked if she was alive,” Austin’s sister, Autumn, said.
Austin spent two weeks in the hospital.
In addition to the burns, he had muscle damage and cerebral hemorrhage.
It was a tough experience for the whole family.
You don't expect that.
It’s traumatic for everyone, says Autumn.
According to the airport’s representative, the lightning risk warning system was on at the time of the incident and it is up to the carrier to decide whether to follow it.
Pearson cuts 3,000 jobs and boosts business through dividend cuts
British education group Pearson announced on Friday it will cut 3,000 jobs and cut its dividend by 72% when it embarked on a new restructuring plan in response to pressure on its business.
According to President and CEO John Fallon, the job cuts will mainly be made at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019.
Pearson announced that it will cut costs by <0xC2><0xA3>300m again in May as part of its third austerity programme to reinvigorate businesses weakened by rapid digitalization.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann. The company announced it would keep its outlook for the current year unchanged. Its revenue grew by 1% in the first half of the year to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber hit a military convoy in Afghanistan's capital Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and injuring several others.
According to NATO, five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the Qarabagh area of Kabul.
The blast is the latest in a series of violent attacks in Afghanistan this month, with 30 people killed in an explosion at a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, two people were killed in a suicide bombing at the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said Thursday night’s explosion occurred when a joint NATO-Afghanistan military patrol was attacked with a “man-made explosive device carried by a person.”
The statement said all of the injured were in stable condition and were being treated at a US military hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents said the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the Islamic State terrorist organization in Qarabagh were of major concern to NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20 percent of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide bombing in Kabul, an area predominantly inhabited by Shiite Muslims.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people were killed in a bomb attack in downtown Kabul, the country’s most devastating attack by a militant group since the U.S.-led forces overthrew the Taliban in 2001.
The violence underscores the unstable situation in Afghanistan as President Donald Trump considers whether the United States will send more troops to the country to help the local army and police.
Correspondents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly undermined people's confidence in the government, in its policies and, in particular, in President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses its decision to postpone implementation of smog regulations
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reversed its decision to delay implementation of decisions to reduce smog emissions made during the Obama administration the day after 15 states sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the 2015 so-called “Ozone Definitions” late on Wednesday, saying the decision reflects its commitment to working with the states.
“We believe in dialogue and want to meet the needs of the states,” Scott Pruitt, director of the agency, said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the agency’s intention to postpone the implementation of ozone definitions by one year to October 2018. According to the definitions, smog pollution is measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution needs to be reduced in line with increasingly stringent air quality standards.
On Tuesday, the agency sued 15 predominantly Democratic-controlled states, including the District of Columbia, alleging that the delay was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration has been looking for ways to mitigate the environmental regulations of Barack Obama’s time. According to Trump, the measures are part of a broader program aimed at economic growth.
Trump’s actions have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of increased emissions.
According to the EPA’s website, breathing air that contains ozone “could impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms,” such as asthma.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, one of the leading figures of ISIS had also sent bomb components to Sydney.
The bomb was reportedly scheduled to be taken on July 15, but the attempt was halted before security checks were carried out.
Police have not said why the company was stopped.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a device that emits toxic colorless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, such as a public transport.
Australian Deputy Federal Commissioner Michael Phelan says the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Because of suspected terrorist plots, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations continue.
Neste CEO: Renewable fuels did well
Oil refiner Neste’s earnings before taxes fell, but beat the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to President and CEO Matti Lievonen, the company achieved good results in oil products, the sales volumes of renewable products reached a record level, and the development of the Marketing & Services segment’s operating profit was in the right direction.
Last year, the comparable operating profit was improved by the US Blenders Tax Credit.
According to Lievonen, the operating profit of renewable products remained at a good level this year, thanks to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects, and we will complete the strategic investments announced earlier in 2017,” Lievonen said in a statement.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko discuss a possible match in their first meeting
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are supposed to be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match of the under 66.7 kg series in the near future, met each other for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at the ESPN sports channel in Los Angeles until WBC's undefeated lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked down the aisle to greet Lomachenko, the WBO's upper featherweight champion.
Garcia won Showtime on Saturday with the unanimous decision of former four-weight world champion Adrien Broner. Since then, Garcia and Lomachenko have been in the top five in the list of boxers of different weight classes.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and asked, “How are you doing, Master?
Good luck with the match!"
Lomachenko will defend his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN at 7 a.m. on Saturday.
When the two posed for the photographers, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas remarked that a match between the two men would be "perfect in terms of size".
"I'm a former plumber," Garcia recalled.
“I moved up the series for the Broner, but I’m not that big.
I'm small, I'm 63.5 kilos.
I want to go back to light.
He's got to get up to the lightweights [61,2 kg], then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Let's fulfill their wishes."
Mr. Lomachenko agreed.
“The fight needs this fight.”
Klimas asked if the match should be held on a pay-per-view channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomachenko, according to which Lomachenko will make his debut in the lightweight series later this year and will fight Garcia next summer (37–0, 30 knockout wins). Garcia would also be interested in facing Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell in the September 23 winner of the match. In Forum, Linares and Campbell kevely
"The match could be on the pay-per-view channel because the fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later announced he was ready to fight on the channel that offers the best prize package.
"We're the most interesting names.
No one else gets as much attention.
As soon as we reach an agreement..."
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as an "incredible fighter" and that he might be going to see the game on Saturday.
Mr. Lomachenko interrupted Garcia's praise and said that the three-weight champion from Riverside looked "really slow. Sorry, Mike... but you needed that knockout."
Garcia said he was focused on showing off his punch force and then boxing.
The men said they felt that the match between them was going to be more and more intense.
“This is the match we are waiting for.
No other game attracts as much attention and interest.
“I’m definitely involved in this,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said he expected to fight the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It will be a great match.”
Average salary 5,300 euros, training what happens - the situation of investment advice was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has been talked about a lot lately.
Most recently, Helsingin Sanomat reported on Ritva, 68, to whom the banker’s investment advisor talked a lot when selling investment products.
The rules for investment advisors and the sale of various investment products will become stricter at the beginning of next year.
The tightening is based on the new MiFID Directive, which will apply from the beginning of next year.
At present, the assessment of the competence of investment advisors and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
The law does not specify competence requirements.
The Financial Services Authority (FA) itself recommends that those working in the investment service complete its own APV1 or APV2 qualification.
The financial sector has authorised the organisation of qualifications for a company called APV Investment Qualifications Ltd, whose degree committee includes experts from the Financial Supervisory Authority (Fiva), universities and other actors in the field.
The examinations are 12-15 ECTS credits and their exams are prepared by Aalto University Executive Education Oy, which offers management development services.
Its website states that, in general, both exams are "quite extensive in terms of requirements".
The study material for the degrees includes 10-15 books as well as numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, Managing Director of APV Investment Examinations Ltd, says that the pass rate of the exams is roughly estimated at around 70 per cent.
Among the staff of the largest banks, approximately all investment service providers have either passed the APV1 or APV2 examination, as these are mandatory according to the companies’ own rules.
Then there are smaller banking firms, without mentioning the names, whose staff seem to have avoided completing the examinations, Savikko says.
He said there are "a few" banks.
According to Savikko, between 13,000 and 14,000 people have completed the APV1 qualification since 2000, and about 3,000 people have completed the more demanding APV2 qualifications recommended for investment advisors.
Some banking firms consider completing a degree to be an advantage.
Most other industries have significantly higher skill requirements.
Savikko says that the recommendation of the Financial Sector requires the completion of APV examinations, because that is when the expertise related to the investment sector is ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisers earn on average several thousand euros per month, including commissions, fringe benefits and performance-based bonuses.
The average earnings of monthly wage earners for regular working hours are approximately EUR 5,300.
On average, men working in positions earn over EUR 5,900 per month and women over EUR 4,500.
On average, the top tithing earns around 8,100 euros.
The tithing of the highest-earning men earns more than EUR 9,000 per month or more, while one-tenth of the highest-earning women earn EUR 6,400 or more.
Investment advice in accordance with the Investment Services Act can only be given by a licensed company.
So far, self-regulation has been relied upon at the employee and job levels.
According to Fiva, its audit revealed individual cases where the investment advisor’s professional skills and competence were not sufficient based on the advisor’s activities.
In principle, you can also act as an investment product seller, even if your skills and qualifications are at a poor level.
In this regard, the situation has been wild and free.
Most other industries have significantly stricter competence requirements,” Savikko says.
According to Savikko, from the beginning of next year, this will be tightened up with the new MiFID II directive.
It requires that each company is responsible for ensuring that the personnel providing investment services is sufficiently competent.
The Financial Supervisory Authority, on the other hand, will have the power to determine what needs to be known.
Marko Hovi, Market Supervisor at Fiva, says that one of the clear changes to the current regulation is the requirements for the competence and experience of investment advisors and sellers of investment products.
According to the Court, the new requirements apply both to the investment firms’ own staff and to tied agents selling products on behalf of a firm.
Hovi says that according to a government proposal issued by the Ministry of Finance, Fiva should have the authority to determine competence and experience.
What exactly they are will be decided in the coming autumn.
In the future, the company must also take care of the necessary training and, if necessary, follow-up and in-service training.
All of this must be documented, and the company has a duty to prove that this has been done.
The court specifies that, in practice, the company must, for example, map the job descriptions of the staff at the individual level.
There will certainly be different levels of requirements for this, depending on whether it is investment advice or the sale of products.
According to the court, the requirement to work with someone more experienced during the term is also new, if the level of expertise or experience is not sufficient.
That is, if the company hires a new employee who does not quite meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person who meets the criteria for a certain period of time.
According to the court, with the change, the rules become stricter and more concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will become stricter at the beginning of 2018.
787 Dreamliner passenger plane 'drawing' giant plane over US
The flight was overtaken by the United States on Flightradar24.
The flight was carried out on Thursday with a 787 Dreamliner, on which Boeing tested the endurance of the aircraft's Rolls Royce engines on a long-haul flight.
In 18 hours and 1 minute, the Seattle-bound plane covered a distance of 15,700 kilometers, the longest commercial airliner in operation in the world.
The flight remained within the borders of the United States.
It flew through 17 states.
Imatra’s tenacious beach swimming schoolchildren won’t mind the rain or the heat of the sun - Iines Kaikkonen staunchly splashed with the help of a swimming pool village
Iines Kaikkonen progressed at a good pace, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra’s beach swimming schools are in Liette and Lempukka this and next week.
Even though it rains sometimes and then it shines again, young swimmers don’t mind,” praises Taina Itkonen, head of the swimming schools.
In this week’s swimming schools, a total of 13 children will improve their swimming skills, and next week a dozen.
The number of children for the coming week was affected by the fact that school and pre-school already begin by then, Itkonen estimates.
The Imatra beach swimming school is organised in cooperation by the Liikunta yhdistys project and the City of Imatra.
On Thursday there was a nice atmosphere at the Liette beach.
The sun was shining and the young swimmers were training to stay afloat with the swimmers, some even without.
The smaller siblings also enjoyed the water.
At 5 o'clock in the morning, he was afraid to go deeper into the water.
Taina Itkonen, however, encouraged him to splash towards the beach.
You're doing great!
He told me that he has been swimming a lot this summer.
Sludge beach is good for him.
Like Iines Kaikkonen, Vili Huhtanen, 5, practised swimming persistently with the swimming village.
You too can be satisfied with today’s achievements, the swim teacher praised.
Jami Kallio, 4, once again wanted to fight in the water.
Ilona Villberg, who has followed her daughter Anna Villberg, 6, swimming from the beach, considers the beach swimming school a good start for learning how to swim.
Even though the weather has been nice, Anna has loved to come here every day.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
Swimming school kids packed up on the pier.
The boys had enough to do with the frog they found on the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels on the pier, nibbled fruit and basked in the sun.
The lesson continued in the water, but there was no hurry on the pier.
When it doesn't belong in the summer.
The Unknown Soldier Is Selling Toilet Brushes – “Here’s Such a Unifying Story”
You see all kinds of things.
Sinituote, a manufacturer of cleaning products, launched the Unknown Soldier product line a couple of days ago.
I mean, dish brushes and laundry racks and a "toilet brush with a rim brush."
The Unknown Soldier refers to the film that will premiere this autumn and to the marketing of the film.
Yet there is something special about the combination, and the products have been ridiculed on social media: When will the Unknown sanitary napkins come?
You have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Aino Määttä, Executive Vice President of Sinituote, say?
We are the film’s partner.
We support this film, as do many other companies.
We wanted to support Finnish production and cult film,” Määttä says.
According to him, there will be a special display of the products in the shops, and the film will thus gain visibility.
Isn’t there something a little funny about this – often when you think that the products and the stories associated with them have something in common?
Yes, there is such a common story here that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products, Määttä says.
According to him, the company supports the same basic Finnish values that are supported by those who have seen the old Unknown Soldier.
And cleaning is not foreign to military culture, Määttä points out.
Other partners in the film include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
So far, Hartwall vichys have been introduced to the market under the names Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unknown products were already in the process of being gutted by Suomen Kuvalehti’s blog Kalle Kinnunen
Coffee and watches are also available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the premiere of the film, so there is still a lot to do.
Of the unknown partners, Valio, Jalostaja, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl have not yet revealed their war products, for example.
New results of Swedish age tests for asylum seekers announced
The latest results of the Swedish asylum-seekers’ medical age tests have been published. The results of the tests carried out using the new assessment method reveal that more than 80% of those tested were determined to be over 18 years of age. However, not everyone considers the tests to be reliable.
The Swedish National Bureau of Forensic Science started testing earlier this year.
The new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was criticised for failing to determine the actual age of applicants who claimed to be minors.
So far, the Finnish Immigration Service has carried out 6,880 tests, and the Forensic Service has now published the results of 2,481 tests. The tests were carried out between mid-March and the end of July 2017.
Eighty per cent of those tested, i.e. in 2002, were determined to be over 18 years of age. In addition, in 25 cases, the Forensic Office determined that the test subject was “possibly 18 years of age or older”.
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker was "possibly under the age of 18".
Tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason to doubt the age indicated by the applicant.
Johan G<0xC3><0xB6>ransson of the Forensic Science Office says the results are in line with those of previous months.
"The figures are quite consistent. There are no big differences to the statistics for the previous months," he told The Local.
Although a large proportion of applicants were determined to be over the age of 18, this does not necessarily mean that applicants have lied about their age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases, there were “suggestions that the subject is 18 years of age or older.”
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it turned out that in 243 cases, the applicant had openly stated that he would turn 18 this year.
The medical age assessment method used in the tests takes X-rays of wisdom teeth and magnetic images of the knee joint. Then dentists and radiologists analyze the images. The method has also been criticized.
One of the sceptics is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institutet, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of humans. The assessment can help determine whether a person has entered puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I believe that the method used is not the right one.
Determining the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't determine for sure the age, we shouldn't pretend that we can," he told Metro.
However, G<0xC3><0xB6>ransson of the Forensic Science Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "Generally speaking, the risk of determining a child as an adult is small.
The risk is highest in a situation where the test subject will soon turn 18 years old, and then the risk is about 10 percent."
Ilonen collapsed 30 places in Scotland
The five over par result in the third round was Mikko Ilonen's 30th down on the score bar in the European Golf Tour competition in Scotland.
Ilonen went to Saturday from shared place 11, but at the end of the round she was found to share place 41.
In difficult weather Ilonen got one double bog with three bogs.
The others were difficult too.
Englishman Ian Poulter stood up to share the top spot in the one under par round, even though he told me that there was enough work to hold onto the umbrella.
The weather was rough, but I hung in there and finally the day was good, Poulter thought.
He shares the top spot with his compatriot Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
West Virginia Governor to Change Party
West Virginia Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night at a Trump campaign event that he is switching sides.
"The Democrats simply abandoned me," Justice said.
“Today I can tell you, after many prayers and careful deliberations...Today I tell the people of West Virginia that I can no longer help you as governor of the Democrats.”
The audience burst into applause.
"Tomorrow, registered as a member of the Republican Party," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time for a new game."
Trump had previously promised that a major announcement would be made at a campaign event in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia by 42 points because Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016, and according to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in the state.
He inherited a mining company from his father and owns coal mines in five states.
His assets are worth about $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee (RNC) released a statement Thursday night saying “Governor Justice’s party change is yet another blow to the Democratic Party that is building barriers rather than building a better America.”
“With only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before, Justice’s announcement is the latest setback for a party that lacks any leadership and can’t find a positive message that unites people,” Ronna McDaniel, a spokesman for the RNC, said in a statement.
Thunderstorms have caused damage - Thursday will be the hardest day of the summer
There will be more thunderstorms in southern Finland later this week.
During the past week there has been thunderstorms especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Southwest Finland.
During the night between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning strikes ignited several fires.
According to a meteorologist, Thursday could be the biggest day of the summer so far.
The thunderstorms have finally found Finland.
During the past week there has been lightning especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Southwest Finland.
At P<0xC3><0xB6>ytyä, lightning struck the row house’s electrical centre, causing a small fire.
The fire was reported to the fire department at about 15 minutes to midnight on Wednesday.
The electrical centre was located at the end of a terraced house.
The rescue service demolished the roof and wall to find the fires and quickly put out the fire.
A total of eleven apartments were left without electricity, but personal injuries were avoided.
In Loimaa, on the other hand, lightning lit up the outbuilding on Harjulantie before midnight.
When the rescue department arrived, the building was already in a full stage of fire, and the rescue department had no choice but to prevent the fire from spreading.
A 50-square-meter outbuilding was burned to the ground.
In the direction of Kuopio in Rääkkylä, lightning struck again a detached house.
The occupants of the house were outside the building, witnessing a flash of lightning.
The rescue department visited the scene to check on the incident, but this time the lightning did not start a fire - only a few fuses were blown.
In traffic, thunder caused problems on the train track between Seinäjoki and Vaasa, when a lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
The incident occurred between 8 and 9 a.m. on Thursday morning, after which the trains were replaced by buses.
The problem was not resolved until a little before five in the afternoon.
Since then, rail traffic has been able to continue normally also on the thunderous section of the railway line.
Lightning has been wreaking havoc all over Finland.
However, lightning has been comparatively low this summer.
These thunderstorms this summer have been absolutely miserable!” says Jari Tuovinen, on duty meteorologist at the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
The thunderstorms on Wednesday and Thursday have been mostly moderate in intensity, but due to the small amount of lightning in the summer, it seems to many even strong.
This might seem like a really hard thunderstorm, but that’s what it has been compared to this summer’s thunderstorms,” Tuovinen says.
On Wednesday the ground lightning flashed 1,700 times, and on Thursday there has been potential for even the toughest thunderstorm of the summer: by about 4 p.m., there were 1,790 ground lightning flashes in the plaque.
If the lightning continues into the early evening, then more than two thousand lightnings can be reached, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record-breaking year of thunderstorms was in 2015, when the number of lightnings per year was about 30,000.
By Wednesday, this year’s flash count had risen to 18,386.
This year is not going to break the “record” set two years ago.
However, the thunderstorm can be expected to continue.
According to Tuovinen, the air mass over Finland will remain warm and moist also during the rest of the week, which is an ideal environment for thunderstorms.
The main focus of thunderstorms is expected to shift to Saturday from the northern parts of the country to the south, where about 2,000 lightning days can be obtained on both Saturday and Sunday.
There will be a more uniform rain plain in the central part of the country.
According to Tuovinen, it only rarely thunders in such cases.
Coe praises Russia's 'open-minded' apology for doping scandal
World athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised the apology Russia issued on Thursday over the doping scandal, but added that it was not yet time to end Russia’s ban.
Russian athletics director Dmitry Shlyachtin said at the IAAF Congress on Thursday that Russia’s ban was appropriate and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry "for all the athletes who were stripped of their gold or silver medals".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of extending the ban. Russia was excluded from athletics competitions in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report provided evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think his answer today was very direct; it was very open-minded," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
“The whole Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Athletics Federation admitted that the country had gone through difficult times and said that it would do everything in its power to reorganize its activities.”
Mr Coe also said he was "satisfied" with Russia's acceptance of the conditions for lifting the ban.
“I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the working group’s recommendation that now is not the right time to end the Russian ban,” Coe said.
“In the coming months, we must do everything we can to normalise the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupt system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral athletes at the IAAF World Athletics Championships in London starting on Friday. They have met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had a number of requirements to meet before it could be reinstated.
"Testing is still inadequate, and banned coaches are still operating freely," he told reporters Friday after his presentation to the IAAF Council in London.
Production company disappointed in Tom of Finland's poor success
Tom of Finland was not as successful as the filmmakers had hoped, Yle says.
To be honest, I am disappointed, admits Annika Sucksdorff, CEO of Helsinki Film, who produced the film, in an interview with Yle.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached more than 100,000 viewers, which is a small amount compared to the film’s budget of around five million euros.
It didn’t win the lottery, but now it’s important for investors to get theirs back.
If the film had been more successful in the home country, they would have already received their money.
Now we have to wait for small brooks of foreign spreads, Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoski.
How football’s financial rules affect Neymar’s move to Paris
Rules restricting the use of money by European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from being transferred from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris Saint-Germain, France, the most expensive transfer of players in football history.
Its possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by UEFA, the governing body of European football, which may prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
In 2011, UEFA adopted the Fair Play Financial Rules, which require PSG to demonstrate that Neymar’s transfer has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona was paid 222 million euros to end the Brazilian contract, and Neymar’s annual salary with the new club is tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France involves a wide range of economic considerations.
PSG will have no problem paying Neymar's transfer fee and including him in their Starfleet squad, as it will finance Qatar's oil-rich dynasty.
The clubs are allowed to spend large sums of money to acquire players, but these must be balanced with real sources of income so that the football business is not loss-making.
The economic rules of fair play were drawn up on the initiative of Michel Platini, the Frenchman who was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini felt that the pursuit of success by indebtedness was cheating and led to serious problems if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the focus of fair play financial rules shifted from clubs’ debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that implementation of the business model first used by Roman Abramovich at Chelsea in 2003 became significantly more difficult. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge amounts of money on player acquisitions and created a global brand.
The current three-year review of the Fair Play rules will last until 2018, during which time clubs will be allowed to make a maximum loss of €30 million.
Although Platini was forced to step down as UEFA president in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, also wants to curb the clubs’ reckless spending of money.
"The rules of fair play are still in place, and we will continue to apply them in the future," UEFA's Andrea Traverso told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of the contract for a lump sum payment, it may write off the amount for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be booked as an annual expense of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years.
The first sanctions were imposed in 2014 on PSG and Manchester City, which are funded from Abu Dhabi.
PSG was fined €60 million, which was later reduced to €20 million, and the club was ordered to limit its Champions League group to 21 players for the 2014–15 season, instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is monitoring clubs that may try to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their income through companies affiliated with the club’s owners.
For example, if a Qatari company subsidises PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be above normal market levels, UEFA will not count the aid as actual income.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the Qatar Tourism Authority’s support for PSG was excessive.
It has also emerged that some of Neymar’s earnings at PSG could be financed by payments from Qatar’s 2022 World Cup organising committee.
However, PSG and the organising committee have denied that Neymar is going to be made the World Cup ambassador, and it would be very easy for UEFA to reveal such an arrangement.
As a result of PSG’s previous sanctions, UEFA is following attempts to circumvent the rules more closely than usual.
Sources said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed with PSG the transfer of Neymar.
Sources gave an interview to the Associated Press on the condition that their identity not be revealed because they do not have the authority to discuss PSG’s situation.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG’s net sales in 2015–2016 were EUR 542.4 million and operating profit was over EUR 10 million.
The financial statements for the previous year have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to attract new sponsors and increase sales of club products and jerseys.
The club estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30 % as a result of the Neymar agreement.
Clearly irritated by the departure of one of the best players in the world, the Spanish league tried to make Neymar's move more difficult, allegedly in violation of the economic rules of fair play.
"This is a clear economic doping case for both the club and the state," Javier Tebas, president of the Spanish league, told the Spanish AS newspaper, referring to PSG's Qatari ownership.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger also has reservations about the state funding of the football club, which is owned by an American sports tycoon.
"The incident is the result of ownership that has completely changed the environment in which football operates over the past 15 years," Wenger said.
“Anything is possible after the state owns the football team.
It will be very difficult to follow the economic rules of fair play. There are so many different interests involved in having a famous player represent the state."
Finland's World Cup Athlete's Coach Stuck in Helsinki
Long jumper Arttu Pajulahti and triple jumper Kristiina Mäkelä’s coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, even though he should be coaching for the World Championships in Athletics in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without her coach’s advice.
Pajulahti will compete in the long jump qualifier tomorrow and Mäkelä on Saturday in the triple jump qualifier.
However, Ghazaryan, the Armenian coach of the pair, has not been granted a visa to enter the UK.
Ghazaryan has tried to handle the matter on the British Broadcasting Corporation without success.
The coach has the invitation of the World Cup organizers as a document, but even this has not been enough to get a visa.
I wonder if this is one of the first symptoms of Brexit, right, said coaching director Jorma Kemppainen.
He has always been successful in handling visa matters himself in the past, but now there are some problems.
He'll do anything to get there.
Ghazaryan has worked for the Finnish Athletics Federation SUL for years.
It's not that important.
As long as someone is looking at the steps correctly, Arttu Pajulahti said about the possible absence of his coach.
World Cup medal for Finland in London requires a miracle
The World Championships in Athletics will begin in London on Friday and will last for over a week, ending on Sunday 13 August.
Athletics, cross-country skiing and ice hockey are the sports that Finnish bench athletes are passionate about year after year, whether they succeed or not.
In the hearts of athletes, success is measured by medals.
Of course, there are other metrics.
Less attention is paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one value competition to another, where by gaining experience, the athlete’s performance is matured to the level that the World Championships for adults is genuinely possible.
Now there are no such young athletes in Finland’s small World Cup team, nor are there any veterans.
A World Cup medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the excitement and surprise of the sport is that miracles can happen.
It draws the bench athletes to the TV screen and glue to watch the races, although due to the time difference, the London medals are not solved until late at night.
At the 2015 World Championships in Athletics, Finland won one bronze medal.
It was brought by the javelin thrower Tero Pitkämäki.
The braves are still waiting for the medal from Pitkämäki, even though the results of her and other throwers and Pitkämäki's remaining in the qualifying at last summer's prestigious competitions tell another story.
Whatever happens in these games, Pitkämäki will go down in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
For other Finnish athletes to enter the finals or to set their own record is a good enough performance.
Hope and faith in the realistic medal hunt of Finnish athletics in the coming years will give good success in international youth competitions this summer as well.
It is more important to nurture the talents of young people and support their work financially than to maintain a small elite group of sportsmen and sportswomen.
Success does not come in an instant, but requires years of sweaty work from athletes and patience from both coaching and bench athletes.
Finns are also able to appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
I hope that the London Games will go down in history as the Usain Bolt and Mo Farah Games, and not, for example, because of the fear of terrorism or cowardly attacks.
Enni Rukajärvi 2nd in Copper's big air - "But I'm sorry"
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi has finished second in the big air race in Colorado.
The 2nd place on Copper Mountain is the best big air World Cup in Rukajärvi.
The winner was Jamie Anderson from the United States.
Rukajärvi scored 147 points in the competition.
With his last jump, he tried the Caballerial 1080 for the first time in the race, and it was very close to success.
It feels good and I feel good now, but I'm sad that the last jump didn't go quite right.
I will try to do it again from now on, Rukajärvi thought.
In the big air of snowboarding, a competitor jumps from a jump made for the sport.
Viking Line’s new high-speed ferry docked in Helsinki
The shipping company Viking’s new high-speed vessel FSTR is long overdue.
The express ship was due to leave Helsinki for Tallinn at 6 p.m.
The ship was loading at eight o'clock.
The ship arrived in Helsinki late.
I've been waiting an hour and a half to get on the boat.
Now the car queue is moving a bit, Johannes Rebane, an Estonian waiting for the ferry at the Port of Helsinki, told at 7.30 p.m.
Rebane thought that the new ship had experienced a technical failure.
Rebane said the shipping company had brought bottles of water for those waiting to get on board.
Viking Communications Manager Christa Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nlund tells IS that there has been a technical failure.
It was repaired at the Port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a few hours late.
Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nlund says that the ship will also be delayed for a couple of hours on the return trip to Tallinn.
The ship was due to leave Tallinn at 8:15 p.m.
42-metre special transport disrupts traffic on Kuutostie on Thursday evening

Transportation from 9 a.m. should arrive by 11 p.m.
The police control traffic on Route 6, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
From Mälkiä the transport proceeds along road 13 to the port of Mustola.
Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The story chronicles both the characters' 80's glory days and 90's grunge (during which time David Wain and Michael Showalter made a great MTV sketch series for The State) and their own time - 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars of the series moved on to bigger things.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the constant memory we are stuck in in the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it seems outdated.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, and not only because of its absurd humor (it was, among other things, told as the background story of a vegetable can speaking in the voice of H. Jon Benjamin).
The essence of the joke is that middle-aged actors play lusty teenagers approaching adulthood. Emphasizing it makes the impossibility of reaching the past part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, in which adults play adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: it parodies, for example, 90’s stalker movies, such as the horror film The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.
At one point, one of the characters digs up an Apple Powerbook, inline skates, and "other stuff from 1991."
Many of the stories are the same as before.
Good-hearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And one crazy plot involves Ronald Reagan (also known as Michael Showalter) and his accomplice George H. W. Bush (played aptly by Michael Ian Black).
As always in such series, sideways are the best.
It’s especially fun to see Paul Rudd, an eternal youth with a beard tattoo under his lower lip, Matt Dillon’s “soul patch” from the movie Singles. Rudd’s Andy, the camp king, is already becoming an old man.
Moments of random madness may propel this series into motion as a sort of recursive Seven Up! series, until it reaches its obvious conclusion: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. In its final scene, a group of friends goes to the premiere of Wet Hot American Summer.
Amazon’s Comrade Detective series, on the other hand, appeals to a different kind of nostalgia: the Cold War spirit of The Americans, the Atomic Blonde movie, and even the GLOW wrestling franchise, where the East meets the West.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Rhys Thomas, the comedy series is a 1980s Romanian police drama in which a Bucharest cop couple fights for truth, atheism and Marxism-Leninism.
The film stars Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici as Gregor and Iosef, respectively. Their lines have been dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea,
But there's not much else it is.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (policemen spend their time watching chess on TV in the same way that Americans watch football).
Featuring a host of famous voice actors including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chlo<0xC3><0xAB> Sevigny, spotting them makes for a fun game.
But Comrade Detective gets too caught up in imitating a clumsy socialist drama – including a killer behind a Reagan mask, for example. That’s why the series often starts to feel like real clumsy propaganda.
The six long episodes are too long, and the series’ humor is neither fast enough nor abundant.
In summary, the series might work better as an Agitprop satire, for example, when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy and there are always two fat men in the lobby devouring hamburgers.
The message to the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can turn everything into consumer goods and fast food.
The fictional Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we devoured our own recent history and theirs as a nuisance.
Toni Tauru from Kouvola will enter the ring in Macau on Saturday - against a former UFC fighter
Toni Tauru wants to keep the fight going.
In Macau, Toni Tauru is beaten hard by Brazilian Leandro Issa, who fought at the UFC last year.
The Brazilian also has the black belt of jujutsu and the world championship in this sport.
For once, I'm fighting myself against an older man.
It’s a funny thing,” the 32-year-old said.
He was scheduled to enter the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three fights were quickly brought to Macao, China's autonomous region.
The Taurus has never faced anything like this before.
This was the first time my game was cancelled.
It was annoying, because it took a lot of time to prepare and train.
However, the fighter is pleased that a new date has been set for the fight.
Waiting for a week doesn’t do much to prepare.
The transfer does not affect the condition, as it does not improve in a week.
It can get worse if you exercise too much.
In the last few battles, Taurus has faced opponents whose strengths lie in standing.
This time the situation is different.
Issa is described as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
I bet he'll come in the first period hard on top and try to take me to the mat.
He's won the Jujitsu World Championship, so he knows how to wrestle.
The last game of the tournament did not go according to plan.
Kevin Belingon of the Philippines hit Taurus in the eye, and the Philippines won.
I've never fought so well, especially standing up: he didn't get any hits.
When I hit him, he hit me in the eye.
It was a very long time.
A new motivation
Some of the runners fight once a year, some get up more often.
For example, the future opponent Issa last fought in September.
We had three matches last year.
This is the second battle of the year.
Sometimes the pace has become pregnant.
I have been training for the last few years and have been in good shape all the time.
I only fought for the sake of fighting.
When the 32-year-old heard about the upcoming encounter, he decided to change the landscape for a while.
I was training in Espoo and I got my joy back.
We had a really good training with a friend from Sweden.
The training was a great help, because on Saturday the Kouvolan has to prepare for a physical fight.
I have had the opportunity to train against opponents of the same size and to practice standing.
The fight is the 32-year-old’s main tactic.
You have to hit sensibly.
If I get a chance, I’ll go myself.
Downstream exports must not be given free of charge, as they consume the most.
Macao attracts the Tauru, which has been fought in China before.
They say it's Las Vegas in China.
I think we're gonna have a big, fancy night.
The Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates unchanged when economic growth has been sluggish and the easing of inflation has put an end to speculation about interest rate hikes.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be slow. The bank postponed interest rate hikes due to increased pressure on family incomes.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee voted 6–2 to keep interest rates at 0.25 per cent. Interest rate hikes received less support this month due to weak economic growth.
In its quarterly inflation review, the bank lowered its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that household incomes are under increasing pressure as inflation is still expected to accelerate to close to 3% in the autumn.
According to the bank, however, interest rate hikes will be needed in the coming years to curb the inflation spurred by Brexit. In addition, the bank announced that loan costs may need to be increased more than expected in the financial markets.
In addition, the committee members decided to cancel part of the massive economic package that began to be implemented a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will discontinue the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide <0xC2><0xA3>15 million more in funding to banks through the scheme, a total of <0xC2><0xA3>115 million.
The Bank's interest rate decision protocol states: "According to the forecast of the Monetary Policy Committee, the slow development of GDP will continue in the coming years, as a fall in households' real incomes will reduce consumption."
With regard to interest rates, the Bank reiterated the need for a "some tightening of monetary policy" to curb inflation "beyond market expectations".
The market is currently forecasting a first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and a second in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any increases would be "gradual" and "limited".
In May, the bank forecasted growth of 1.9 per cent for this year and 1.7 per cent for next year.
Now it kept its growth forecast for 2018 at 1.8%.
The pound weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared with the dollar, the pound depreciated by 0.5 per cent to $1.31, while it depreciated by 0.4 per cent to €1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was taken after weaker-than-expected growth rates dampened increased expectations for interest rate hikes, with GDP growing by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter and 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.
The Bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its most recent review of inflation gave little hope to households suffering from accelerating inflation and low wage increases. The bank says the situation will get worse before it gets better.
The bank added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" a drop in income in the coming years, but it expects wage developments to "significantly" recover at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by the strong growth in demand for British products as a result of the weak pound sterling, which will offset part of the fall in private consumption.
The decision came a year after interest rates were lowered to 0.25% following a shocking EU referendum that plunged the pound into a slump.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to be reflected in prices and the economy only after four years.
Before the central bank’s latest decision, the demand for interest rate hikes had become even louder as inflation increased the pressure on households. In July, three policymakers called for an interest rate hike of 0.5%.
Inflation fell last month to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent in June, but the bank said it was expected to pick up again in the coming months.
According to the bank, the excess over its 2% target was "totally" due to the weakness of the pound.
“Given the recent decline in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market seems to be intensifying as lenders frantically seek customers and want to end the year strongly,” said Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"The market looks particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is about to expire. Repurchase agreements are increasingly popular, with low interest rates and cost-free options."
NHS Orders 10,000 Controversial HIV Drugs
As of September, patients will be able to be prescribed a "transcendent" anti-HIV drug. In the Supreme Court, a dispute over the financing of the drug in the UK's public health care system (NHS) was concluded.
The NHS reported that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is prescribed to approximately 10,000 people during the first three-year trial. A pre-coital drug has been found to reduce the risk of infection by approximately 86% in high-risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld last year's Supreme Court ruling that the NHS would be able to pay for PrEP, even though it claims that it should be funded by local authorities.
Britain’s NHS director Simon Stevens called Thursday’s decision a “major new intervention” and the national AIDS organisation described it as “a crucial moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to start accepting registrations for the trial, which will expand to other clinics in October. The trial will reach its full extent in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV medicine taken before sexual activity to reduce the risk of infection.
Experiments have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in high-risk groups.
Taking a medicine before sexual activity means that there are enough medicines in the body to prevent HIV infection during sexual activity.
The drug can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The treatment target group includes gay men, bisexual men and transgender people, as well as people with an HIV-positive partner who is not receiving effective treatment.
The clinics will select eligible candidates from men, women and transgender people, as well as those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral therapy for their disease.
People who live in England and are registered for general medical care can also apply for a trial at their local sexual health clinic.
The programme will cost <0xC2><0xA3>10 million, and the UK’s NHS signed a supply contract for medicines this week after an international tender.
The aim of the trial is to assess the potential of PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence on its targeting, uptake and treatment implementation.
"This major new intervention should complement and enhance the already existing, diverse and increasingly effective HIV prevention tools," Stevens said.
“It is yet another remarkable achievement in the more than 30 years of struggle to solve one of mankind’s greatest health challenges.”
“This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV,” said Deborah Gold, director of the National AIDS Association.
“If PrEP is correctly targeted at people in need and at risk, it can have a transformative effect on the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, those at risk will receive a drug through an NHS-funded trial, which they can decide to use independently without the need to consult a partner. It will have an empowering effect that will improve the lives of a very large number of people.
That was welcome news.”
“The most important thing now is to make sure that the experiment is launched quickly across the country and that no one at risk is left out,” said Ian Green, director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The PrEP drug used in the trial has been procured, and we will soon be able to protect 10,000 people at risk from HIV infection."
“The launch of the PrEP trial is a welcome event that was unnecessarily delayed for several months due to government slowdowns,” said Sharon Hodgson, the shadow government’s health minister.
“We have evidence that the drug can have a transformative effect on our work to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this menacing disease.
The experiment will help us better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
What is important now is to launch the experiment as soon as possible across the country to protect those exposed to HIV and get one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society."
Quality of life: the mid-floor and smart interior solutions have made a small Earl's Court apartment a spacious home
Ex-banker Joanne Leigh moved from Knightsbridge to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a house in the style of Queen Anna's era. The success of the renovation is evidenced by the fact that Joanne has not yet packed her stuff and moved.
“I used to live with my ex in a much larger apartment in Knightsbridge,” Joanne says.
"I'm looking for something similar in my price range.
I came here to see the apartment screen and noticed that the rooms were as high as in my apartment at the time.
I was immediately impressed and made an offer on the same day.”
Since then, the apartment of about 90 square meters has undergone a complete transformation.
Joanne wanted more storage space and an intermediate floor, so that the height of the room could be utilised.
"I wanted space, big windows and lots of light.
Those were my demands,” he said.
He hired Erfan Azad from Duck & Shed, a design agency based in Notting Hill. Erfan was tasked with utilizing the space of rooms almost four meters high and creating an apartment that would not only be a place for renovation and sale, but also a home.
The height of the room was not quite enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an intermediate floor where one could stand.
The solution required Erfan to think creatively.
"Steel structures are quite complicated.
The rooms had to be arranged in such a way that there was no need to crouch.
The structures had to be modified so that the height was just right both on top of and under them."
Erfan was able to place two full-height rooms on top of each other with fascinating details.
On the mezzanine floor, a Retrouvius window with a copper grid opens into an elegant lounge.
Mirrored furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille vintage lamps create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, a sense of space and light.
Mirrors at either end of the short corridor make the corridor seem longer than it actually is.
A mirror in the middle of the kitchen is like a window that opens into another room.
The mirror-surfaced furniture at the entrance has storage space for Joanne’s cutlery and glassware.
The fact that the kitchen can be hidden when not in use adds to the elegance.
Kitchens with folding doors are not a new solution,
But what's unique about Joanne's kitchen is that the door is lifted up in the same way as the garage door.
“It took a bit of planning,” Erfan says of the steel-reinforced veneered MDF door.
“It’s balanced, meaning it slides very easily into place when you lift it.”
With sensible use of space and storage space planning, Joanne got 16 extra square metres, a second bedroom and an even better layout.
“When selling an apartment, the area is the key – or the valuation of the property,” Erfan says.
"In the basic case, the realtor walks into the apartment and calculates the price based on the area."
In Joanne's apartment, the area was increased using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
"The occupant is in contact with the materials in the apartment, and the emotional bond to the apartment is partly formed on the basis of these materials," Erfan says.
"No one gets attached to the electrical wires running through the walls.
They are important, but not in the same way.”
Joanne’s apartment is an example of how good design and additional square meters can make a basic apartment exceptionally nice.
It may also happen that you no longer want to move out of the apartment.
Pregnant Princess Sofia Shines in Her Summer Look
Princess Sofia's outfit was just right.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden for the last time before giving birth.
For the dinner at A Sustainable Tomorrow, the princess had chosen a light blue dress.
Sofia represented the occasion with a smile.
Princess Sofia of Sweden has visited B<0xC3><0xA5>stad this week.
On Wednesday afternoon Sofia represented us at the A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a gorgeous blue figure-hugging outfit that dressed up the pregnant princess in her final moments.
Sofia came to the event in a dark blue outfit.
This is the last time Sofia will be represented before her birth.
His due date is in September.
For the event dinner Sofia had chosen to wear a beautiful pastel blue dress that landed beautifully.
The style was crowned by large earrings and an elegant little bag.
The pastel blue dressed the princess nicely.
Sofia has been on a mission in B<0xC3><0xA5>stad, Sweden this week.
Sofia completed her outfit with a small bag.
Sofia was radiating in her fresh summer look.
At the event, Sofia even got excited to talk to the photographers.
Now I’m just holding my stomach,” Sofia said, laughing and referring to her final pregnancy.
He's raising us with sweet chili.
In the summer of 1996, a shop selling Thai food appeared on the market in Lahti.
The people of Lahti did not dare to taste, but walked by.
At home, Panya Suamsri-Penttilä sold food, Panja among friends.
He didn’t speak much Finnish, and the Finns didn’t know Thai at the time.
Since the people did not dare to go to dinner, Panja offered free tastings.
This is how he taught the people of Lahti to eat Thai food, one spring roll at a time.
Taste it, he said.
I got hooked on lac.
I went there more and more, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened her Thai restaurant in Lahti Market Hall.
There were two small tables, I think there were less than 20 seats.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to a stranger.
When you’re hungry and places are limited, you can’t leave an empty chair between you and a stranger.
We got to know each other better and became friends.
Finally, I sat down at the plate with a dictionary to learn Thai.
Two years went by on the side of the market hall, but then the restaurant had to move, because the self-made spice pastes smelled too much in the hall.
A new place became available at the end of the market.
There's room.
Now we drinkers get to sit at our own tables again, only during the busiest times we have to shyly ask the guests if there is room next to us.
Panja knows his customers.
They tell him where they’ve been and who they’ve seen.
He knows what food everyone is eating.
She has seen how the clients’ life stages change and the food club changes.
He remembers the name of the man I went to eat my first spring rolls with.
She remembers me being thin and fat, and she remembers how I was when I was young.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than the others, sit next to the kitchen door and exchange news with Panja who is leaning on the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
She has taught tolerance and internationality with sweet chili sauce.
In addition to our senses of taste, he has opened our thoughts and hearts.
Nowadays, many people speak Thai to him, thanks to the growing popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he's had a hard time, he's always friendly.
He's a hard worker.
On top of the restaurant work, he goes for mushrooms and blueberries.
Last week, the restaurant quietly celebrated two decades of celebration.
We, the customers, had strawberry cake for dessert.
Without any fuss or attention, this remarkable day was spent at work.
The discovery of an underground base revealed 173 ISIS terrorists who were ready to attack Europe
In the beginning of the year, the security authorities received an important list for counter-terrorism work.
The list contains information about more than 170 ISIS fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are a total of 173 people and the document contains not only their personal data but also pictures of each of them.
More than 130 Iraqis are on the list, but six Europeans are also on the list.
They come from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikistan and Saudi Arabia.
He told me about the list and a couple of weeks back.
Now the location of the list and the information it contains have been clarified.
According to the newspaper, special forces of the Iraqi army found a list of the terrorists' personal details and pictures while investigating the terrorist organization's underground base in Mosul.
U.S. intelligence officials assessed the authenticity of the documents and forwarded them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
There was a fear that something big and serious was being planned in the West by terrorists after the defeat of ISIS in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and pictures of all the people, but also their date of birth, invented aliases, and information about their country of origin.
The list also includes specific areas of expertise for terrorists.
For example, the 27-year-old German Sami J. on the list has the battle name Abu Assid al-Almani, meaning German.
He reportedly left Germany in 2012 to travel first to Egypt, then to Libya, and later to Syria via Turkey to join ISIS.
Next to his picture is written a speciality suicide bomber.
The fate of the man is not known.
Some 6,000 ISIS fighters have left Europe and their fate is uncertain.
Man sinks beneath the surface in Tokoinranta, Helsinki
According to interviews with the rescue services, the man wanted to show that he could swim.
Even a bucket can save a drowning person's life.
A man was rescued in Tokoinranta, Helsinki, after being underwater on Thursday.
According to Ville Estlander, a firefighter on duty at the Helsinki Rescue Department, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found underwater about 15 minutes after the announcement.
A rescue diver found him under the surface, Estlander says.
The emergency services received a report after 3:30 p.m.
The person was taken to emergency care.
Estlander said he was a 50-year-old man.
According to the interviews, the man wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is over.
Estlander praises the cooperation between the authorities, the Finnish Border Guard and the police.
It was a mission led by the Border Guard.
The divers were also excellent at guiding the divers.
It was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and the police.
Two cars collided in Eura, nine people were injured, three seriously
There were a total of nine people in the cars, the rest of whom suffered minor injuries, the firefighter said.
Among the injured are both men and women.
The accident occurred at the intersection of three roads at four o'clock in the day.
The accident happened when one car turned from behind the warning triangle in front of the other car, says the on-call firefighter.
According to the rescue service, the intersection has an 80-kilometer-hour speed limit.
Brothers fight over $500 million in real estate
Two brothers argue over Victoria’s largest real estate empire, valued at over $500 million, over a family business founded by their Italian family 40 years ago.
Colin De Lutis, the former president and real estate developer of Carlton Football Club, lives in the prestigious Torak district just three houses away from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has taken the dispute over the division of real estate and business between the brothers to the Supreme Court.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but the divorce is bitterly disputed.
Together, the brothers and their mother, Anna, own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, and the family began accumulating wealth when they bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
The family founded the Westco Jeans store there, which expanded into a chain of 160 stores.
The chain sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was spent on real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and apartments in the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping malls in the suburbs.
According to the agreement with the deceased father, Colin owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul owns about one-third of the company's assets.
According to court documents, the property split ratio means that Colin owns properties worth about $316 million, and Paul owns properties worth about $176 million.
Paul is not satisfied with the distribution of real estate and money.
“I think Colin left the best properties to himself in his proposal,” Paul wrote in his first affidavit to the court in 2015.
The case was heard last Friday by the Supreme Court for the first time after several attempts at mediation.
The brothers are now also arguing over who controls the existing business. Paul claims Colin has excluded him from the business.
Colin says this isn't true, and he accuses Paul of mismanaging some of the properties.
Colin writes in one of his first affidavits that he would like to find a solution.
“In line with our Italian traditions, family is the most important thing to me,” Colin said in a statement.
The costs of the case are constantly increasing. There are hundreds of pages of sworn statements, emails and reports. The case is being investigated by consulting companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as some of the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded milk bars and delicatessens in the late 1950s, and in the early 1970s they bought a store in Brunswick.
They were used as collateral when the family bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin set up the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he founded the store "in the final years of high school, when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer the property to their sons.
“Luigi often said he didn’t want the brothers to go to court,” she said in a statement.
The other two sons, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis group's business. According to Colin, Mark received $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are "bitter at the financial terms of their departure".
Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former board member of the Australian Football League and a best friend of television star Eddie McGuire, according to his 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin responded, saying in a text message that he couldn't really comment on the matter because it was being tried in court.
“It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our family by name into a legal battle,” she wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to comply with his brother’s demands.
"Our father would not have wanted us to argue like this," Colin continued, adding that he still hoped a solution would be found.
On Friday, the hope seemed to be gone.
"Our case will be decided in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump’s new chief of staff plans to restrict the president’s media use.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally make it.
Number one.
According to Poltico, the White House’s new chief of staff plans to restrict President Trump’s media use and news monitoring so he doesn’t get into trouble as often.
Journalist Josh Dawsey reports:
“When the new White House Chief of Staff, John F. Kelly, met with senior staff on his first day on the job, he addressed a key problem he intends to solve: he intends to restrict President Donald Trump’s access to information.
Kelly told White House staff that all information, whether printed or at press conferences, must pass through him because the president makes better decisions when he gets good information.
Kelly’s words make sense, but others have tried to restrict Trump’s media use and failed.
President Trump has had a relationship with television for decades – and as president, he still watches a lot of television.
“If President-elect Trump was upset by the unfair news, it was worth showing that the sympathetic media treated things more fairly,” Sam Nunberg, Trump’s campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri, a Politico reporter, wrote at the time that “six former campaign workers say it’s essential for Trump to have a steady stream of praise in his personal media stream to control his use of Twitter.”
Yes, sir.
But it’s ridiculous to claim that Trump’s use of Twitter was ever under control.
Maybe these campaign workers know something the rest of us don’t – maybe Trump’s tweets would have been even wilder without their efforts.
We will probably never know what kind of messages Trump left unsent.
If his staff has been able to prevent him from causing problems at least a few times, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing a stir.
Part of the problem is that there are competing factions in the White House that are trying to push their case by giving Trump information that supports their point of view. That information may or may not be reliable.
In May, Politico wrote that the advisers deliberately gave the president questionable information.
Reporter Shane Goldmacher reported on one case:
"Trump's current and former employees say that he can get very angry at newspaper clippings that criticize him - especially if they report harmful information leaks - so he has no choice but to know where the information came from.
That’s what happened at the end of February when someone mischievously gave the president a copy of the GotNews.com report, founded by online provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of multiple White House leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter due to harassment and had previously circulated false accusations and subsequently withdrawn them. He also failed to provide concrete evidence.
Despite this, Trump had started asking staff about Walsh after reading the story.”
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter had “attempted to introduce a document management system for Trump.”
And what was the result?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his aides are still running their own errands.
These immutable facts make Kelly’s mission very difficult.
Neymar signs five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with French football club PSG.
Earlier on Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar’s agents had paid FC Barcelona, which plays in the Spanish league, a buyout price of 222 million euros.
Neymar's contract with Barcelona was therefore terminated and he was free to move to Parisian club PSG.
The transfer of 222 million euros is the biggest in football history.
The record was previously held by Manchester United, which last summer paid 105 million euros for Frenchman Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by former Qatari professional tennis player Nasser al-Khelaifi.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
The best-selling author Raija Oranen overcomes alcoholism and fear of flying with hypnosis: "I am in good shape in my life"
The best-selling author Raija Oranen has just celebrated her 69th birthday.
Hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
Five grandchildren hold her so tightly to writing that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola’s apartment after 18 winters.
At first they sold their house, but now in the spring they also rented an apartment.
Into the light and the sun, away from the old circles Raijan was once taken by depression and alcoholism, from which he has survived.
The exterior is also 20 kilos lighter.
The weight went down when the serotonin drugs were stopped, they were anti-depressants.
I was helped with alcoholism by hypnosis, which also worked for fear of flying, I won it.
I have been alcohol free for 15 years now.
“Alcohol takes a person,” the author says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been on the same journey for more than 45 years.
I'm better than I've ever been.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who has also worked in the tourism industry, have been travelling together for over 40 years.
I proposed, and it was getting married in two weeks,” Raija laughs.
That’s the kind of drama queen she’s always been, ended her life like that, Jyrki laughs at his wife.
Oranen, who has made an extensive career as a writer, only remembers the 44-part TV series Pure White Sheets, which touched and moved Finland during the recession.
When I read Liisa Seppälä's 50th anniversary interview on the plane, I decided to finally start the clothing industry in the Fresh Family company.
I was the daughter of a seamstress myself, my mother also had a clothing store and I sometimes worked as a mannequin,” Oranen recalls.
He felt that the plot and story of the series changed the attitude of Finns towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen’s research and dissertation revealed this, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives an active time as a writer, she has many manuscripts in the works - hundreds of ideas.
Travelers return across a ditch to “millionaire’s alley”
One of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands is once again on the cusp of persistent nomads who managed to cross the ditch the municipality needs and return to the fields next to the houses.
Travelers parked about 20 of their caravans in Solihull, near a street known as the Millionaire’s Lane.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the moat that the municipality needed as an obstacle to the procession, bringing with them children, horses and an army of vans.
The travelers managed to cross the obstacle at a point that had been left unprotected because of the path.
Infuriated residents have accused the municipality of Solihull of being “completely unable to solve the problem”.
An anonymous resident said the travelers came from Bentley Heath on Monday night, where they had thrown stones at passersby.
"The municipality has to be toughened up to act because it seems to be completely incapable of solving the problem.
The travelers were here in May, then they left but returned again.
There will be more tonight, and probably more tonight.”
The resident said that the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by banning access to the parks.
“I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it’s frustrating to pay municipal tax when the municipality can’t do anything about it.”
According to another resident who remains anonymous, it is ridiculous that the nomads returned so soon after they were driven away.
"They're outnumbered, and they've even let a horse graze in a park."
A spokesman for Solihull County said: "We are taking the necessary legal action with the Solihull Police to evict the campers as soon as possible.
In order to gather evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report any disturbing or criminal activity to the police.
It helps to form an overall picture of the situation for the court proceedings."
Infuriated people surrounded the Portuguese plane
The men who crashed on a crowded beach in Portugal have been questioned in court today.
Two people died yesterday as a result of the forced landing.
The two men who flew the plane could be charged with manslaughter.
The maximum sentence in Portugal is 16 years in prison.
Yesterday, a small plane made by men had to crash-land on the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica near Lisbon due to a technical problem.
There were hundreds of people on the beach at the time of the incident, some of whom ran away from the plane landing in the water.
The plane hit a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl, who died instantly.
The plane first hit a man with his back to the plane.
Immediately after that, the plane took off and when it landed again, it hit the child’s head,” said Filipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias, who was on the beach.
The little girl was on the beach with her parents.
The girl’s parents were not injured.
The people on the beach surrounded the small plane immediately after the accident in anger.
The girl’s father and other people went to the machine and started beating on the tail, Celia Rocha, who witnessed the incident, told the newspaper Correio da Manha.
The man called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It's a miracle no more people died.
The two men on board were not injured in the crash.
The Finnish star who tragically lost his leg won the World Cup once again: "Without accident I would not be world champion"
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated the World Cup in banked slalom early on Wednesday morning in Big White, Canada.
Suur-Hamari also won the gold medal in the World Cross Championships.
All in all, there are now three World Cup titles.
What an incredible World Cup!
Twice the gold was treated, with quite a good heart rate is drawn, the phone-reached Suur-Hamari rejoiced.
The 30-year-old skier thanked his coach and very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Suur-Hamar, the number of challengers in the sport is growing all the time.
The whole paralumiboarding has grown and developed a lot lately.
The differences are getting smaller, and there are a lot of new skiers involved.
Always wondering if there's a black horse in the back.
Every race seems to have a different winner.
Suur-Hamari lost one leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
She had been skiing enthusiastically with her friends since she was young, and the accident did not take her to the slopes.
From time to time, I wonder what my life would be like without that disaster.
But my attitude has always been that there is no point in ifsitating.
The cards that are dealt are the ones that are played, Suur-Hamari emphasizes.
It would be cruel to call a serious accident and the loss of a limb a stroke of luck, and Great Hamari does not do so.
But he turned a terrible difficulty to his advantage.
Yes, I would say that the situation turned into a victory.
I wouldn't be a three-time world champion if it wasn't for the accident.
Before the accident, 23-year-old Suur-Hamari’s greatest enthusiasm for snowboarding was already waning.
My work towards the top really started only after the accident.
When I was young, I worked out with my friends, and we were always so excited about X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that faded somewhat with time.
After the accident I somehow found myself at the start of X-Games.
I couldn't have imagined it in advance.
I was 23 years old, and I thought it would be a very long life if I stayed here to grieve.
I decided to put on my overalls and get to work.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
The skier was very pleased with the choice of wheelchair user Leo-Pekka Tähti as the athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic gold medallist was awarded at a sporting event in January.
According to Suur-Hamar, the victory of the star is an important signal for paraathletes.
It was a big deal, and the win was definitely deserved.
This will definitely open your eyes to the world of parasport.
When is it time to launch the Athlete of the Year campaign of Matti Suur-Hamar, the two-time world champion?
We'll see in time.
I try my best to succeed.
The Great Hamari has not yet conquered all the peaks he craves.
Next year has a big goal.
The Paralympics will be held in South Korea in a year.
We’re going to get a medal!
Majority of Syrian refugee youth do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently unless the war ends and ISIS leaves the country
The A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees baking bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youths do not expect to return to their homeland permanently.
The end of the war in Syria and the departure of ISIS are the most important things that should happen in order for them to return to their homeland.
The Trump administration is not seen to be bringing change to the Syrian conflict.
Communication agency chain Burson-Marsteller surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in an international study.
Burson-Marsteller has spent nine years researching the opinions and attitudes of Arab youth.
This year, A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 young Syrians aged 18-24 responded to the survey, half of whom were women and half men.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the survey, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not expect to return to their home country permanently in the future.
42% of the respondents may think they will return to their home country and 4% could not say.
According to the study, the decision of young people to return home is most affected by the ongoing war in Syria and the presence of ISIS in the country.
Nearly half (47%) think that the end of the war is the most important factor for a permanent return home, while a quarter think that the most important thing would be for ISIS to leave the country.
Fewer than one-tenth of the respondents cite the improvement in the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria as the most important factors influencing the decision.
Military action alone will not solve the conflict.
Young Syrians were asked what was the most important factor in ending the conflict.
The majority believe that an end to the war is more important than the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad.
More than a quarter see Assad’s presidency as an obstacle to a peace deal.
Nearly half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the ongoing conflict in Syria.
More than a quarter believe in resolving the conflict by military action alone.
The majority of Syrian refugee youth see ISIS’s power weakened over the past year, while one in five feel its power has strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important thing in the fight against ISIS, and terrorism in general, is for the media to inform people that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many cited military measures and education reform as the primary means.
The top ten think that the most important thing is to create better-paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the impact of the Trump administration on the Syrian conflict, 66 percent of respondents believe that the conflict will not change under the Trump administration.
Nearly one in four believe the conflict in Syria will get worse during Trump’s presidency.
Opinions are divided on whether the involvement of Russia and Iran has improved or worsened the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half of his time coding to keep the web organized – his database is used by Wikipedia and Google, for example.
The Espoo-based company MariaDB is developing the "world's fastest growing" open source database.
The main product of MariaDB, founded by code entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, costs users absolutely nothing and can be developed online by any talented programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they are not necessarily paying customers.
With the help of databases, huge amounts of data are kept organized and quickly accessible.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in image format comes from the database, and the images are also linked there," explains Widenius.
MariaDB’s Chief Technology Officer, Widenius, spends about half of his time coding.
A man working remotely from Kauniainen makes sure that the internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world’s most popular open source database, MySQL, together with Swedish developer David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun acquired MySQL for $1 billion, and a year later software giant Oracle devoured Sun for $7.4 billion.
When the Oracle deal happened, a large portion of the developers of MySQL announced that they were leaving.
“They didn’t want to work for Oracle, which didn’t make a firm promise about the future of MySQL,” Widenius recalls.
He had already started a company that started to develop MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired about twenty of the best developers from Sun and made sure that the continuity of the code is secured with the help of the same friends who created it.
Because MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
I just had to change the name.
A foundation was established to monitor the development of the MariaDB code.
"During MySQL, these verifications were not done," Widenius laments.
Although many people have heard of Widenius and the MySQL billion trade, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
“Over the past few years, our annual growth rate has been about 50 percent,” says Kenneth Paqvalén, CFO of MariaDB.
MariaDB, which focuses on growth, is not yet making a profit, and Paqvalén is scarcely speaking about the company’s key figures.
He reveals that MariaDB expects to receive orders worth EUR 20 million in the current financial year.
Because the database is free, the company has developed services around it that business customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps with the exchange of databases, which can be more than a year’s work if the client has used a closed database.
You can switch from MySQL to MariaDB in no time, because they are versions of each other.
Among others, Spanish operator Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica and the largest bank in Southeast Asia, DBS, are MariaDB’s paying customers.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft’s Azure, Alibaba’s Cloud, offer their customers MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB automatically spreads to new users in Linux operating system distributions, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we are a small company, we have connections to the biggest players.
“Our customers include the world’s largest telecom operators, gaming companies, banks and even a few central banks,” Paqvalén said.
The database market is still dominated by giants like Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with their closed databases.
For Oracle, MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company’s traditional closed database.
Although, according to research firm Gartner, the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, in terms of turnover, players such as MariaDB are still insignificant, although growing rapidly.
In the $50 billion database market, open source databases don’t even reach a billion.
However, the value of open source cannot be measured only in money, as most users do not pay anything for these software.
Research firm Gartner predicts that by 2018, companies will be developing more than 70 percent of their internal applications on top of open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been replaced by open ones or at least the transition would have started.
The big companies will not get new customers because most of them will choose open source next.
As a result, the licensing fees for commercial databases have skyrocketed.
Companies want to make as much money as they used to with fewer customers,” Widenius says.
Since it is difficult to exchange a closed database, the majority of customer companies have been obedient in absorbing price increases.
“There are a lot of customers who find it really difficult to migrate because their old apps and others are stuck in a closed database,” Widenius says.
But he still believes that his clients are getting the hang of it.
With license fees rising every year, sooner or later the customer will move to an open source database.
The price is 10-20 percent from the previous, and the service is better, because the customer can easily switch to another database if he wants.
In addition, many companies are facing major system changes as they migrate their operations to cloud services.
At the same time, many people change database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received EUR 25 million in loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the largest EIB growth funding ever granted to the Nordic countries.
The company has about 115 employees worldwide and is now looking to hire more.
One of the reasons for EIB financing was the impact of MariaDB on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector customers in countries such as the UK and Germany.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros a year for databases.
“Many countries want to move to open source solutions and use tax money more efficiently,” Paqvalén says.
Widenius is saddened by how Finland spends money on, say, closed healthcare systems, when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some people say that open source is an ideology, but I think it’s a better way to make code.
The community helps and does things that it cannot invent or do itself.
The 55-year-old Widenius is one of the most well-known open source promoters, along with Linus Torvalds, another Finnish Linux developer.
Widenius helps other companies to develop functional business models on top of open source.
I still give four or five speeches a year around the world on this topic.
Italy tightens its stance on NGO rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs which rescue refugees on their ships in the Mediterranean that they must not continue to operate unless they commit to comply with the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit to the new Code of Conduct, it will be difficult to see how they can continue to operate," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin's La Stampa newspaper.
Minnit's warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a ship belonging to the German aid organisation Jugend Rettet, whose crew is suspected of collaborating with human traffickers to promote illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which had been operating for only a year, refused to comment on the detailed charges brought by prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
“Saving lives is and will remain our top priority, and we deeply regret that we are not able to operate in the search and rescue area at this time,” the organization said in a statement.
"We will only be able to assess the allegations once we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the Jugend Rettet Iuventa vessel since October.
The crew is suspected of taking boatloads of refugees on board directly from human traffickers, who regained access to the boats.
One such case is alleged to have occurred just a few kilometres off the Libyan coast, according to a prosecutor's document published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of having defied the Italian Coast Guard, which is overseeing rescue operations in the area.
According to the Code of Conduct, vessels such as the Iuventa should be accompanied by an Italian police officer who supervises the operation.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in the search and rescue effort have so far agreed to comply with the Code of Conduct: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS, and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
which said on Thursday that it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable because they would not create "significant changes or obstacles" to the organisation's rescue efforts.
Among those who refused to comply with the Code of Conduct is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Médecins sans Fronti<0xC3><0xA8>res.
Minniti said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks, which she sees as a sign that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors are beginning to bear fruit.
“In the last few days, there has been a light at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He revealed plans to continue discussions this month with Libyan mayors on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees heading towards Europe.
Seasonal worker suspected of killing her partner in Enonteki<0xC3><0xB6>, suspect found in field - case to prosecutor
The alleged crime took place in Enonteki<0xC3><0xB6> last December.
Police say a 36-year-old Czech man is suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish partner.
It has been previously reported that both of them were seasonal workers.
Police also said the suspect had fled with two dogs.
The man was found cold in the terrain and did not resist when captured.
The case must be filed in less than a week.
The case may be heard in the District Court of Lapland in August.
Robert Hardy, known for Harry Potter and the All-Haired Friends series, has died.
Actor Robert Hardy has died at the age of 91.
The actor’s death was announced by his family on Thursday.
Born in 1925, Hardy began his acting career at the age of 24.
During his long career, he also appeared in films and television.
Hardy is especially remembered for his role as Minister of Magic Cornelius Toffee in the Harry Potter films and his role as a veterinarian in the television series All My Furry Friends, based on the book by James Herriot.
The BBC’s most popular series was filmed for seven seasons.
Michelle Carter Sentenced to Prison for Inciting Suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison for texting and calling her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, is serving 15 months in prison and five years on parole.
Carter was convicted of manslaughter in June, and her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
"My family is devastated," Conrad's father said at Thursday's hearing.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter appealed the decision and was allowed to wait for the application to be processed in freedom.
He was sentenced to 20 years in prison, but his lawyers said both Carter and Roy suffered from mental health problems.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream-coloured blouse, Carter listened to his verdict with his hands crossed and his eyes fixed on the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"He ended Conrad's life to improve his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the crime,” the prosecutor continued.
"He has shown no remorse."
Carter's lawyer said the incident was due to "shocking circumstances that Carter deeply regrets."
However, Justice Lawrence Moniz said Carter's "age or maturity level, or even mental health problems, had no significant impact on what he did."
The prosecutor read a statement by Conrad’s mother, Lynn Roy, in which she said, “Not a day goes by that I don’t mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I'm coping with all this, and I'm trying my best to comfort his sisters in this pain that we'll always carry."
Conrad’s sister, Camdyn Roy, told the court that she was “persecuted” by the idea that she would never see her brother’s wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"It's painful to lose someone who's been in my life every day since I was born. That pain will never go away," Camdyn said.
The case seems to set a precedent, as the state of Massachusetts does not have a law that makes incitement to suicide a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a car in 2014.
The case drew national attention when it emerged that Carter had incited his boyfriend to commit suicide in his text messages.
"Get rid of yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself. I don't know, there are many ways," Carter wrote in many messages that he had sent to Roy in the two weeks before his death. Roy was on vacation with his family at the time.
Shortly before Roy’s suicide, Carter wrote, “You’ve got to do it, Conrad” and “You just have to turn on the generator, and you’re free and happy.”
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention with Roy's death, and the judge ordered Carter not to take advantage of the case by giving interviews.
The case has divided the opinions of experts.
One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of the murder of a British roommate in Italy in 2007. She was released two years later.
In an op-ed published by the Los Angeles Times, Knox stated, “Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not jail.”
NATO Secretary-General: Relations with Russia worst since Cold War
Relations between NATO and Russia have clearly deteriorated, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its position in the Ukraine conflict.
“I think it’s fair to say that NATO’s relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War,” Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could pursue close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continuing instability caused by Russia in the region of Eastern Ukraine, NATO’s relationship with Russia has deteriorated significantly.
Stoltenberg said that NATO is still committed to ensuring that tensions do not escalate.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia to avoid escalation and a new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg’s remarks, US President Donald Trump noted that relations between the United States and Russia had deteriorated to dangerously low levels.
Trump called on the two countries to thank Congress, which last week approved new sanctions against Russia.
Audi changes 850,000 diesel engines due to car manufacturers’ setback
The day before the announcement, BMW offered to update the software of more than 350,000 cars.
The BMW CEO said that the company believes that "there are more sensible options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including BMW's home city of Munich, which are considering restricting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will make changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies said anything about a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to meet their CO2 targets.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The cost of installing emission-neutralising equipment increases, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are being closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of adhering to the big car companies and ignoring the problems.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes. Volkswagen installed cheating devices in cars that reduced emissions to meet regulations in tests. In normal driving, emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen executives have been indicted in the United States, but their actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of Audi’s engine development department, responsible for thermodynamics, was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and could be extradited to the United States for trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen. Authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in its cars that could circumvent European emissions requirements. The accusation was based on a similar study in the United States.
Audi’s investigation could significantly weaken Volkswagen’s position: the luxury car manufacturer’s share of Volkswagen’s profits is disproportionate.
Venezuela’s vote sparked a crackdown, with large-scale protests
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million more than the number of actual voters.
"This is an unprecedented opinion of a company that has no role in the election result," National Election Commission chairman Tibisay Lucenan told reporters.
Maduro vows to end the crisis
Venezuela's parliament was elected on Sunday to amend the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised demonstrations against changing it.
The anti-Maduro opposition has postponed its own demonstrations so that they would take place at the time of the appointment.
According to El Pais newspaper, national security forces began taking over the country’s parliament building on Wednesday evening.
The purpose of the force is to ensure the security of the appointment.
Climate change threatens Provence's lavender
Lavender has become a symbol of the Provence region in the south of France, but now it is threatened by climate change.
Due to drought and disease-carrying insects, lavender was reduced, and scientists and farmers were frantically trying to find a solution to the problem.
“Lavender is an endangered species in the Provence region because it has suffered from the effects of climate change in recent years, which has led to a significant reduction in rainfall in spring and autumn in particular,” said Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM research institute, which specialises in agriculture in Provence.
“This reduces the lifespan of the lavender.
In addition, the drought has brought many small cicadas to the area, which spread microbial bacteria."
The stakes are high.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and it is also a highly sought-after ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
"Instead of long shoots and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed or weakened or missing altogether," Chaisse says.
“In other words, there are fewer parts that contain essential oil.”
The solution is sought by intensifying irrigation, slowing down soil moisture evaporation, spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water, and developing drought-resistant varieties.
The murder of a journalist is a growing threat in Mexico.
The editors of the once-weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss the latest cases involving organized crime, corrupt officials, and the endless war on drugs in Sinaloa state.
Today, however, we are discussing security in the light of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been urged to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists discuss which is safer: leaving the children at home or taking them with them to a delivery that was hit by a grenade in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the blackboard in the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask journalists for names for each category, no evidence is required, observations and sensations are sufficient.
They write down the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists who are suspected of being on the payroll of the government or drug cartels, criminals who make the news of Mexico’s chaos life-threatening.
Violence is incessant and journalists are increasingly targeted. According to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto took office in December 2012. There are 589 journalists under federal protection who have been attacked and threatened. This year at least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states.
Among the most recent victims is Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder, editor and inspiration for Riodoce.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books about drug violence.
He is deeply missed, even though he is present everywhere. The facade of the building in Riodoce is covered with a huge picture in which Valdez shows his middle finger. The photo reads: "Justice". Journalists in their thirties Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in T-shirts, which are decorated with Valdez's smiling face. Valdez wears glasses and becomes a trademark
The meeting takes place less than two months after Valdez’s death, and the reporters discuss their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia, and fears of paranoia.
A federal prosecutor’s office was created in 2010, specifically to deal with journalists’ cases, but according to the Journalists’ Protection Committee, only two charges have been filed so far.
Journalist murderers are rarely brought to justice, just as few of the thousands of murders each year linked to drug trafficking and organised crime are brought to justice.
Riodoce’s journalists intend to continue writing about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are saddened and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security conference is of little use because the killers are not known and there is no hope of justice.
“This meeting is, frankly, a waste of time,” he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know what's going on."
Valdez had left the Riodoce facility in the state capital Culiacan on the morning of May 15, 2017.
He had driven only a couple of blocks in his red Toyota when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and fired twelve shots. The number is presumably related to the magazine’s name: Riodoce means the twelfth river.
The shooter drove off in Valdez's car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was 50.
He was survived by his wife and two grown children.
Rumors move quickly and circulate freely in the Culiacan.
However, Valdez’s death is a matter of silence.
Sinaloa has been Mexico’s bloodiest battlefield since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January. Competing factions want to fill the void.
In the streets of Sinaloa, one or more people are shot to death every day, and the cemetery has ornate two-story tombstones of drug barons that are larger than many homes.
In a coastal state, it is “peaceful” when only one cartel controls the ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, the founder and leader of Riodoce, 60, feels guilty for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez, who leads a rival faction waging war against the sons of Guzman.
The case may have angered Guzman’s sons: customers suspected of being members of the gang bought every issue of the magazine as soon as the magazine came into circulation.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper that published the same story was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in the violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career in Noroeste when, in 2003, he decided to establish Riodoce with five colleagues. At that time, the shares of the magazine were sold for $50.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without addressing the drug problem," Bojorquez says.
As time went on, the magazine became known for its bold and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenues grew.
Journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish hard-core investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were intrigued by stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its coverage of Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez was awarded the International Press Freedom Prize by the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage to follow the story of the drug trade in Mexico incessantly.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to move on with my life," he said when receiving the Journalists' Protection Committee award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a "way of life," Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
“A journalist must accept the task that falls to him – or play the fool.
I don’t want anyone to have to ask me where I was when death was being bathed here – why didn’t I tell them what was going on?”
The staff at Riodoce misses Valdez – a joker who cursed like a dock worker. They miss a friend who always gave them hugs and advice. They miss a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted her routine.
He always wore a Panama hat.
He visited the El Guayabo bar across the street from the editorial office and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if the routines were her destiny.
The death of a colleague has also made them think about how they can best do their job and stay alive.
“Criminals don’t like it when we deal with their women and children and their pure businesses, their secret drug-trafficking airstrips.
They were left out of the story,” Bojorquez said.
At best, it meant strong self-censorship and self-protection.
Trust your own instincts.
If you feel that everything is not right, you need to stay away.
The problem, according to Riodoce's journalist Andres Villarreal, is that "the impression can be deceiving, and that is what happened in Javier's case".
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
A few days earlier, it had emerged that only government-sold spyware had been used to track activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two policemen had taken shelter in the shade of a tree from a 40-degree heat.
The state government had ordered them to guard the Riodoce premises, which are located in a four-story building in the middle-class Culiacan area.
Some journalists were half-joking as to whether these two police officers were among the 50 percent whom the governor of the state considered unreliable.
It had been months since journalists had visited a mountainous countryside dominated by drug gangs.
For this week's issue, Riodoce's editorial had three headlines planned.
Julio Cesar Chavez's brother was killed in Sinaloa.
The newspaper also planned to reveal that the government's spending had been concentrated in the governor's hometown.
In addition, a group of people had been kidnapped in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, just a block from the D.A.’s office.
There was no official information as to who had been abducted and how, so caution had to be exercised: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug traffickers and the authorities.
The reporter found out from public records that the restaurant was registered to a politician from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated Mexican politics at every level for almost a century.
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked the journalist to write about previous incidents in the same place. In one of them, the son of "El Chapo" Guzman managed to escape and avoid an army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that Valdez’s column would provide reliable information about the kidnapping.
"In the past, we would have known what had happened," says 46-year-old Villarreal, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slender physique.
"Now all communications with our informants are down."
Valdez’s office has been converted into a warehouse where anti-persecution signs and stickers are stored. The newspaper’s employees have been given a new, unexpected task: they have become press freedom activists.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took a few signs with her when she left for the local prosecutor’s office the next morning to protest yet another murder of a journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez's murder.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found, which, according to DNA tests carried out by the authorities, is Adame.
Journalists have begun to protest more loudly across the country. In the demonstrations, "SOS Press" texts appear on the sidewalks and buildings.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is seeking international support for the investigation of the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez met with the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying on and killing journalists for telling the truth.
He has since asked to be removed from government cases because he is concerned that his anger cannot be objective.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, the authorities that allowed it, and an uncaring society.
In his last book, Drug Journalism, Valdez writes that while drug gangs kill journalists, they are also killed at the behest of politicians and security forces, in agreement with organized crime.
According to the Articulo 19 monitoring group, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were by the police and authorities.
"In Mexico, people are silenced by killing," Ramirez said.
Murder has a paralyzing effect.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Next to his body was a note signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my writings."
Next to his severed head was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some newspapers have decided to close down, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua, following the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Some continue to operate, such as Nuevo Laredo's El Manana, even though its leader was assassinated in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez posted a message on its front page to the drug cartels: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their states or the country as a whole.
It's a difficult decision.
It is difficult to find a job in exile and we must be on our guard at all times.
Sometimes the criminals sought out a journalist, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he fled Veracruz.
For those who continue to work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra, who was supposed to be a poet, admits that writing about the drug trade is scary.
“I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell,” he says.
Some time ago, Riodoce's reporters were sitting in front of the editorial office on Friday at midnight, having a beer on the sidewalk, after the latest issue of the magazine had been completed.
A shootout between rival gangs and security forces at the Mazatlan beach resort killed 19 people.
The war escalated, as promised in the cartel messages found in the area.
The reporters posted the news on Riodoce’s website from the sidewalk on their smartphones.
The front page had to be redone the next day.
Sirens were howling nearby—another shooting scene.
Bojorquez glanced at the officers guarding the delivery:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
Riodoce’s editorial continued the tradition of the magazine’s murdered founder under this massive portrait of a man showing a middle finger across Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can't even think about shutting it down. "How could I shut down a newspaper when our intern asked me to go out on the street and do a case the day Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project started with a huge setback - "Hard place"
In April, Hannu Manninen turned 39 years old and his party was short, as a professional pilot started to prepare for the Olympic season.
The training season, however, began disastrously when Manninen fell ill with the flu.
This was the beginning of a long illness that lasted almost five weeks.
In May, I was almost completely sick.
First I had the flu and finally I had a childhood disease like otitis, in which I had to take a course of antibiotics.
I was only able to do 10% of the planned exercises.
I can’t remember the last time I was sick for so long.
It was a tough place when I couldn’t make use of my training enthusiasm,” Manninen tells Ilta-Sanomat.
Test result collapsed
The World Champion of 2007 received his training permit only in the second week of June, which was visible in the rolling mat test conducted by the KIHU Research Centre for Racing and Top Sports on 12 June.
In the test, the athlete skis on a roller ski on a mat, the speed of which is increased every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the mat stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a sample of lactic acid from the athlete’s fingertip with a needle.
Last autumn I spent 32 minutes on the carpet, but now I only stayed for 28 minutes.
Fire against the wall, Manninen says.
For the better
At the beginning of his life, Manninen said he was in good health.
I have done a variety of calm aerobic exercises with which I have tried to normalize the body’s metabolism.
Now we have a really good five-week period.
We also had a one and a half week vacation from flying.
I also had time to go to the cottage with my family.
Last season Manninen took part in only four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Cup.
The best result was seen in the opening race, when Manninen finished 18th in top skiing.
Guidelines Drawn
Manninen and the head coach of the national team Petter Kukkonen have drawn up a training and competition plan that runs until next February.
We are now looking for a different rhythm for training compared to last season.
After the first snow race Ruka would have three World Cup weekend.
In December I would like to participate in at least one World Cup weekend, maybe in Ramsau.
By the end of January, we will be in Seefeld.
Hopefully, after that, the name will be on the Olympic team’s list,” Manninen says.
The PyeongChang Olympics would be Manninen’s sixth Winter Olympics.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, the Nummela underline, who celebrated gold in Salt Lake City 2002 team competition.
The dinosaur disguised itself from its enemies.
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now, scientists have revealed the first findings of a rhino-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner that was so well-preserved that experts call it the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.
It was so well preserved that researchers were even able to determine that its scaly skin was reddish-brown and had a “problematic past.”
According to Current Biology, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur of all time and one of the best of its kind in the world.
The fossil is a nodosaurus that lived between 110 and 112 million years ago.
Scientists consider this amazingly well-preserved fossil to be a truly remarkable discovery.
According to National Geographic, the armored vegetarian is the best-preserved fossil of its kind ever.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that didn’t seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to study his discovery in more detail.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Paleontological Museum in Tyrrell.
There, the beast was excavated for six years from a 1,100-kilogram boulder.
The results of hard work can now be seen.
"If you squint your eyes, you can almost believe it was asleep," says Caleb Brown, a science writer who works as a researcher at the Royal Museum of Tyrrell.
"It will go down in the history of science as the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
Skin’s research revealed that flesh-eating dinosaurs were likely a significant threat to this vegetarian, even though it had armor and resembled a walking tank.
Its red-and-white armor camouflaged it from predators, and it was also protected by a darker and lighter underside coloration, which is still found in many animals.
According to experts, it was better able to blend in with its surroundings and avoid its enemies, the larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old nodosaurus made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Paleontological Museum in Tyrrell.
Scientists have named it Boreale after Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who spent more than 7,000 hours excavating the dinosaur.
The Nodosaurus has survived so amazingly well that Mitchell and an international team of scientists have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its scales and armor on its body.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by a common coloring in which the body is darker on the outside and lighter underneath.
The sighting was still a surprise, because Borealope is much larger than the current animals, which have the same coloring.
This suggests that meat-eating dinosaurs preyed on it to such an extent that evolution favored hiding over fighting as a means of survival.
Modern animals such as deer, zebras and armadillos have a similar coloring. They are significantly smaller and therefore easier to catch, suggesting that even the nodosaurus was seriously threatened.
"The predatory behavior of a large, heavily armored dinosaur tells us how dangerous the Cretaceous dinosaurs were," Brown says.
A chemical analysis of organic compounds in the scales of the Nodosaurus reveals that its skin was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaurus to draw conclusions about its life, including examining the contents of its gut to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Scientists believe that when it died, it fell into a river and drifted into the sea, where it sank on its back to the seabed.
Alberta was then as warm as Florida is now, and the rivers and seas likely extended much further than they do today.
"This nodosaurus is really remarkable because its scaly skin has been preserved, and it has also preserved three-dimensionally in its original form," Brown says.
"That's why it looks almost the same as in the early Cretaceous period
It doesn’t take much imagination to perceive it: if you squint a little, you can almost believe it was asleep.”
The Cretaceous was the age of theropods, huge bipedal flesh-eating dinosaurs.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years before Borealopelta, its mighty predecessors may have preyed on this armored dinosaur.
The predecessors of the Tyrannosaurus rex included, for example, the Acrocanthosaurus, a six-ton monster about 11.5 meters long.
The latest findings by Nodosaurus scientists have been published in the journal Current Biology. They believe that Borealope was washed into the sea after his death and mummified in the mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, with skins and armor from snout to hip.
The Nodosaurs were on average five metres long and weighed up to 1,300 kilograms.
Two six-foot [half-meter] spikes rose from their platforms.
Scientists believe that this armored vegetarian passed through what is now western Canada until a flooded river carried it out to the open sea.
Its armor has been preserved down to the smallest detail in an underwater tomb.
Its fossilized remains are so well preserved that its skin still remains in the hollow plates of the armor along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic that such survival is "as rare as winning the lottery.
The closer you look at it, the more amazing it seems.
The hollow plates of its skull armor still contain fossilized leather.
Its right forefoot is on its side, five toes upward.
I can also count the scales on the soles of the feet."
How did one activist learn to answer the question: To whom do the streets belong?
Brittany Ferrell was shocked on August 9, 2014.
He had arrived in New York the day before from his home in St. Louis and was sitting on the bed in his Airbnb apartment, browsing Facebook on his phone.
Then he noticed a message from his high school friend:
“The police just killed an 18-year-old young man, and his body is still on the street.”
Confused, he noticed that no one else had posted the same information in his feed, so he shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous retweets from <0x40>TheePharoah.
The username belongs to a rapper in St. Louis who tweeted in real time about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who was shot dead by white police in Ferguson, Missouri.
The user had also posted a photo of Brown’s lifeless body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
When he returned to Twitter later that night, it was reported that people were gathering at Canfield Drive.
Users posted pictures of police deadlocks and screaming people, as well as a man claiming to be Brown’s father, who carried a sign that read, “Ferguson Police just killed my unarmed son!”
Ferrell watched a live video of police standing in front of the protesters with a barking dog.
He also said he saw a video of another police officer arming his rifle and shouting, “I’m going to kill all of you...animals.”
"This is not normal," Ferrell recalled.
"It wasn't the kind of murder we're used to and could be said to be typical.
That's when I felt the chills.
I was angry and crying.”
He booked a return flight home the next day.
Ferrell went to pick up his six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next nearly three years has been made into a documentary film called "Whose Streets?", which premiered in cinemas on August 11, 2017.
The film is a story of survival and expression, love and loss, and strength and perseverance from the perspective of the local people who took to the streets to demand answers.
As Ferrell drove toward Ferguson with his daughter in a flower dress and matching crown, they had a renewed conversation about "what it's like to be black and under what circumstances" and had spoken about it countless times before that morning.
"Remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers saying to his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it's not right."
"I couldn't take my daughter with me," Ferrell said.
“Today’s events are the culmination of the past.
My daughter has a right to know it and to grow up with it.
He needs to be prepared for activism and organization, but he also needs to know the different layers and circumstances of the experience of being black, and he needs to know what we need to do to liberate ourselves.
Although I have been fortunate enough to be able to protect her from blatant racism, she is still the same as other black girls.
I feel that I would harm him if I protected him from reality.”
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, across the street from the police station, which became a camp for activists as they waited for information about the case and eventually learned that no charges would be brought against the police.
From there, Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to the protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to take a new approach to activism.
“My activism completely changed after August 9th,” he says. While studying at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was president of the Association of Minority Nursing Students. At the time, he focused on food law and health disparities in black communities.
“I didn’t have any experience in organizing.
Somehow it just happened.”
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, the documentary's assistant director, at an evening demonstration.
Folayan said he and photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "simply wanted to tell us" what was happening.
Ferrell was suspicious, and he said, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story that you can use?"
The reason for the suspicion was the countless times when people, usually white people, had appeared in the local community, who only wanted to benefit from its difficulties and perseverance.
"We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson had no common voice," Folayan said in a recent interview. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted assistant director Damon Davis, known for his activism with death row inmates.
Davis' involvement prompted Ferrell to join the project, along with six other locals, and the film crew followed the events in the years following Brown's shooting.
“This is not a documentary where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we speak for ourselves,” Davis said.
“The most important thing for me was how the local people are presented in the film, because I am presented in the same way.”
According to Folayan, the intention was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, as it was to show that the popular movement "is not about a charismatic leader, but about a community".
That’s why the documentary shows surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell’s life, such as falling in love and getting married.
“I felt pretty naked,” Ferrell laughs as he describes what it felt like to see the movie for the first time.
"But I realized that this work and the human portrayal of blacks requires a certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell’s story repeats and re-emphasizes the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born on social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after black teenage boy Trayvon Martin was shot and killed by police in 2012. Two of the movement's three founders identify as a queer identity.
“The leadership of black queer women has kept the whole movement going,” Ferrell says. “It’s because we’re constantly fighting on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to endure everything."
Folayan agrees: "The movement is indeed sustained by black women, among whom there are many queer women."
However, he stresses that Ferrell was not chosen for the documentary "self-intentionally" because of his queer identity.
"He got the energy moving," Folayan says.
"It's no coincidence, however, that she was on the front line. Black queer women live in the intersection of many things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is on the screen."
The news crews left Ferguson long ago, but relations between the community and the police are still tense.
Ferrell has two-and-a-half years of probation left, and he was convicted of blocking the freeway during a demonstration.
His description of the socio-political atmosphere of his home corners is brief and concise: "Message."
Yet he still relies on a slogan he memorized on the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains."
A fitting resemblance: an artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning’s DNA
At the Fridman Gallery in New York City, faces are hung in the middle of the exhibition space – white, black and brown faces, between which, if you look closely, you can see a resemblance.
These 30 works are portraits by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning’s cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where he served a 35-year sentence for leaking classified diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks.
Dewey-Hagborg’s exhibition A Becoming Resemblance opened on 2 August 2017.
Dewey-Hagborg is a trans woman and a pioneering dissident, whose prison sentence was commuted by Barack Obama on the third and final day of his term in office.
Dewey-Hagborg analysed Manning’s DNA algorithmically and created 30 portraits based on his genetic data. They are a sharp, albeit somewhat theoretical, statement on the editability, ambiguity, and causal relationships behind interpretations of DNA data, as well as identity.
Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, has openly stated that she has identified with women since puberty and was found guilty of 20 crimes in 2013, including espionage, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning in prison: a grainy, black-and-white selfie with the awkward-looking Manning sitting in the car in the driver’s seat, wearing a platinum-white wig that became his signature.
Dewey-Hagborg had a successful Stranger Visions project in 2015, which he carried out in 2012.
In it, he created portraits based on forensic data, such as DNA data from cigarette butts and chewing gum, and created images of what the people involved might have looked like.
Then the artist received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture for their story," Dewey-Hagborg told a news conference for the new show.
Manning was not allowed to visit or be photographed in prison, so the magazine contacted Chelsea and asked if she would be interested in making a DNA portrait of Manning.
The artist and his imprisoned muse suddenly became pen pals, writing to each other for a couple of years.
They even co-authored the Suppressed Images comic book, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, depicting a future in which the president would have commuted Chelsea’s sentence and she would be able to see the show.
In reality, Obama reduced Manning's sentence just a few days after the publication of the comic book, which was a lucky coincidence after seven hard years in a Kansas military prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition opens right now, as Donald Trump is waging his own war against whistleblowers and transgender soldiers and inventing ever-new ways on Twitter to reinforce the powerful dichotomy he actually needed to bridge.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that “everything has a purpose.”
On the wall of the gallery is a statement by the artist and below it a large autograph of Manning, where the point of the surname i is the heart. In his statement, the artist demands an end to the "automatic division on which gender, race, sexuality and culture have been based".
On the opposite wall is a sequence of Manning's DNA: a long string of C, G, and A's written in pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters – or nucleotides, as the artist uses the scientific definition – Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we all are, at least in our biology.
"I hope that my exhibition will help people to understand that we are equal in our genetic heritage and that the genetic information is very personal and open to interpretation," says Dewey-Hagborg.
"DNA tells countless stories. 30 of them are on display here."
The last work in the exhibition is in its own room: a page from Manning’s and Dewey-Hagborg’s comic book.
In it, Manning’s character emerges from prison like King Kong, holding a megaphone.
“If they can silence you, they’ve won,” the caption reads.
"Never be silent."
"The text is from a letter I got from Manning," a Philadelphia-based artist said.
"It's so impressive that I'm still getting cold flashes."
Contrary to what was described in the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning arrives, he is greeted by a face based on his own genetic information, like a crowd of demonstrators in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is intentional, like everything else in this exhibition: for example, Manning’s DNA sequence is written in pencil at a height equal to his height (157.5 cm).
“The face was on the wall before, but I wanted to bring a crowd feeling to it,” Dewey-Hagborg says.
"I wanted to describe the mass movement that Chelsea created, which was also behind her release."
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted for murder
Police say they have launched a nationwide search to find a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee suspected of stabbing a man to death in a luxury Chicago apartment.
Cook County Court documents show that on Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, suspected of involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, for first-degree murder without the possibility of bail.
Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to a local news release from the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on July 27, 2017.
Police in the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with multiple cuts on his body.
Authorities say Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene, and the stabbing is being investigated as a murder.
Lathem has been an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the university’s vice president for public affairs, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been denied access to Northwestern University’s campuses.
"This is a criminal matter that is being investigated by the authorities, and Northwestern University is helping with the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren is a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
A statement from the university and a spokesperson for Somerville College said: “We have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to assist the US authorities investigating the case in any way we can.”
In addition, the statement said that Warren's colleagues are shocked and hope that he will surrender.
Anthony Guglielmi, the Chicago Police Department’s chief of communications, said he was urging the suspects to “seriously surrender to the authorities.”
"Police have a sense of where they are, and we're constantly refining our search," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielmi, local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
He said police received a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had received a vague hint that something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as horrific.
Guglielm said it was unclear whether the victim had been murdered the same day or earlier.
He said security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been inside the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," Guglielmi said.
The management of the Grand Plaza issued the following statement to the residents: "Police are currently investigating the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
Man threatens to blow up Islamic bookshop and ‘kills Muslims’ in London
“I’m not an anti-Muslim, I’m a Catholic,” he told police.
Moffatt is required to complete 100 hours of unpaid community service.
A 39-year-old man was sentenced for threatening to blow up an Islamic bookshop in London and "kill all Muslims".
According to the Independent, David Moffatt was convicted of aggravated harassment.
According to police, the staff of the bookstore alerted them to the scene on May 23.
According to staff, the man had “threatened to blow up the bookstore and kill the Muslims.”
The suspect left the store after being threatened.
Moffatt was arrested when he called the police about the threat.
The threat had nothing to do with the bookstore.
Authorities discovered that Moffatt was dressed in the same outfit as the suspect, a police spokesman said.
“I’m not anti-Muslim, I’m Catholic,” Moffatt told police.
As a punishment, the man must complete 100 hours of unpaid community service and pay <0xC2><0xA3>620, or about <0xC2><0xA3>690 in legal costs, and <0xC2><0xA3>85, or about <0xC2><0xA3>95 in compensation to the victims.
A spokesman for Scotland Yard said several hate crimes were not reported.
"We will complete the WADA road map in the near future" – Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete measures under the World Anti-Doping Agency’s (WADA) road map to re-establish the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
“Some of the measures under the roadmap have already been implemented and RUSADA has been given the right to design and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
WADA's road map has been updated in this regard," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map, which lays down the conditions for the re-establishment of RUSADA's mandate, and the second part was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing of concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future,” Mutko added.
However, one of the elements of the road map requires the Russian anti-doping authorities to publicly accept the results of a WADA-imposed investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, who is investigating the alleged role of the state in doping in Russian sport.
Mutko said: "The investigation is ongoing because our anti-doping system has admitted to failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no government programs, and we can’t admit what didn’t exist.”
There were echoes of the statement by Vitaly Smirnov, chairman of Russia's independent public anti-doping committee.
Earlier that day, Smirnov, speaking to Russian sports media RSport, admitted that there have been problems with Russian anti-doping agencies. "We have said several times that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
We will not accept the report unconditionally," he added.
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) ordered RUSADA to cease doping control in Russia in November 2015 after the scale of the doping scandal was revealed.
However, last June it was authorised to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA Director Olivier Niggli visited RUSADA's headquarters in Moscow in July, after which he noted that the organisation was "on the right track" towards re-establishing its mandate.
British organisation sceptical of innovation dear to Finns: There is "no evidence" of the health benefits of maternity packages
The British organisation doubts the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
The BBC and the Guardian say that the Lullaby Trust, an organisation that fights against SIDS, prohibits the use of its own brochures in maternity packs distributed in the UK.
The distribution of maternity packs to all pregnant women will start this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some areas.
According to the Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternity package reduces the risk of SIDS.
SIDS is an unexplained sudden death of a baby.
The Lullaby Trust works as an expert for the British health authorities in the field of safe sleep for children.
We no longer allow our official brochures to be packaged in them because that would suggest that we are recommending this product.
Finland has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, with only two deaths per 1,000 births.
According to the Lullaby Trust, a good reading in Finland is the result of many different reasons, including a small number of teen pregnancies.
The fact that each family is given a box there may be one factor.
However, it cannot be said for sure, Francine Bates, CEO of the Lullaby Trust, said.
We are concerned that maternity packages are being marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and SIDS.
The maternity package is a Finnish invention, and it has been given free of charge to all mothers in Finland for 80 years.
The kit includes a variety of accessories, such as children's clothing.
This year, there are 53 products in the package.
The package itself is a cardboard box in which the child can be put to sleep.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes it distributes meet all security standards.
The Lullaby Trust says that there is no safety standard for sleeping in cardboard boxes.
According to the Lullaby Trust, the pack may be the best choice for sleeping if there is no crib or crib available.
The organisation recommends using the pack only for napping and stopping when the child is able to turn around.
The organisation also recommends keeping pets out of the pack and ensuring that they do not get wet or soiled.
Fast-paced scoundrel escapes from Japanese zoo for second time
A Japanese zoo staff is searching for an escaped turtle.
The giant tortoise has surprised the crew with its speed and has escaped for the second time in two weeks.
The turtle escaped from the Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, western Japan, on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the villain exited the zoo through the main entrance.
It doesn’t die right away because it eats grass around the zoo, but we’re very concerned,” said Yoshimi Yamane, who works at the zoo.
The escaped 35-year-old villain is a female, 55 kg and about one meter long.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During the opening hours, the villain is allowed to roam freely in the garden area.
The zoo has not received any eyewitness sightings of the turtle.
The frog's last escape happened two weeks ago.
Yamane found a fugitive walking down the road 150 meters from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help,” Yamane said.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These Startups Can Help Your Business Avoid Uber Mistakes
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction in her e-commerce startup, but the surveys didn’t work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even misleading.
Although he assured them that the questionnaires were anonymous, some employees were suspicious of them.
“The surveys were simply not consistent or objective,” says Errett. As her hair care company, Madison Reed focuses on e-commerce. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to seek outside help.
More and more new types of HR startups have entered the market, helping other companies figure out how their employees are doing.
They develop and license software that can measure employee engagement. Companies can survey and target specific teams and populations, and provide their employees with anonymous reporting services and, in some cases, a direct link to senior management past the board.
“You can track your own health with apps like Strava and Fitbit, but where’s your company’s Fitbit?” asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of Glint, a startup based in Redwood City.
Errett has been using Glint’s software for three years and says that he has gained a deeper insight into the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
The program allows quick polls and polls for specific teams. In addition, it allows you to create a map that shows at a glance which departments employees are most dissatisfied and which managers have received the lowest ratings. Based on these, Errett has been able to drill into the core of the problems.
Companies have understood that they need to follow the culture of the workplace in order not to become the next Uber. There has been a stir around the transportation company since a former employee wrote on his blog about a culture where employees are harassed and those who talk about problems are punished.
For startups like Glint, such omissions are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance is a global industry worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the Let’s Talk Payments website.
Based in Denver, Colorado, Convercent is a start-up that helps companies detect and prevent inappropriate behavior. Interest in the company grew earlier this year when Uber’s reputation was hit hard.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently signed an agreement with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent enables companies to conduct customized surveys, gather responses confidentially in real time, and identify problem areas.
In addition, employees can report inappropriate behaviour anonymously via SMS.
And if there is reason to suspect the manager of misconduct, complaints go directly to the board of directors of the company.
“Public opinion has supplanted the authorities,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
He points out that if a company treats its employees badly or unethically, the consequences can be costly, even if the authorities do not intervene; consumers can start boycotting the company, and it can also lose employees and be sued.
With more than 25,000 employees across 500 locations, Ruby Tuesday has been using Convercent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and can easily connect to the head office.
In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, they had to first find out the phone number or email address that would allow them to report it to their head office, then they had to make a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
"It was often a scary and unpleasant experience," says Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, James Vitrano. According to him, it was difficult to follow up on complaints made by employees.
In the past, problems remained hidden from managers working in another city or state. Now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
“I get a more holistic and comprehensive understanding of the employee’s reality,” says Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday’s risk management team.
"At the same time, we protect our shareholders from employment-related litigation."
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously after Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of unethical conduct in the Enron scandal.
It was only with the advent of social media that companies realised that they could no longer prevent the public investigation of their dirty laundry.
“Hope was used as a strategy before technology came into the control of ethics,” Quinlan says.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, the use of which is regularly charged.
It is a business model and opportunity accepted by venture capitalists. Both Glint and Convercent have venture capitalists behind them.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million in funding from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising a total of $47 million in capital.
In November, Glint received €10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners and has raised a total of $60 million in funding.
Investment is not surprising, given the links between companies, corporate culture and venture capital.
According to several studies, employees expect more from their jobs.
In a competitive market such as Silicon Valley, good salaries and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they are giving their time to a truly useful company.
“Employees are more committed to the company’s success if they feel comfortable in the company and that they are listened to and that their work is rewarding,” said Nina McQueen, director of employee reward and well-being at LinkedIn.
Investors get returns when companies succeed. Companies succeed when employees commit.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it’s no wonder they interest investors.
According to workplace culture experts, information about employee engagement is important.
But it is useless if no action is taken on it.
If a company requests feedback from its employees, this can be seen as a sign of change.
And if change doesn’t come fast enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employee engagement.
“If you ask for four thousand suggestions, you have to be prepared to have four thousand conversations,” says Russell Raath, CEO of Kotter International, a management consulting firm, who has seen companies rely too much on mere data gathering.
“If the company doesn’t take action, employees will start to wonder if they’ve been heard.
And whether their opinions matter.
If the company doesn’t care about them, why should they care about the company?”
According to Errett, Madison Reed currently conducts monthly employee surveys and is able to address the problem on the same day as it is reported to Glint.
After collecting feedback on the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication from frustrated employees, Errett was able to make changes to the teams and arrange communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday has a better understanding of its employees and hopes that a deeper understanding will help it improve employee retention over the long term in an industry known for high employee turnover.
“If a company doesn’t commit to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose employees,” Vitrano says.
If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
Without customers, there are no companies.”
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of taking photos of his naked female neighbor, according to the Swedish news agency TT.
A woman in Gothenburg had come out of the shower at home when she noticed a cell phone hanging from a rope outside her window.
The woman said her cell phone was taped into the apartment.
A frightened woman ran to the other room to get dressed.
When the woman arrived to check the situation, the cell phone was first pulled up, but shortly thereafter lowered again into the window.
A 20-year-old man has admitted to photographing a woman.
He said he only photographed the woman’s face.
The video was removed and police were unable to return it as evidence.
During the interrogations, the man has admitted to the act but denied having committed the crime.
The man explained that he loved his neighbor “quite mad.”
According to the news agency TT, the man will be charged with the case.
Teachers demand more money in autumn negotiations
Wage development cannot be lower than, for example, in the export industry, but the gap should be narrowed, said Olli Luukkainen, President of OAJ on Thursday.
The temporary cut in public sector holiday pay highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to conclude agreements that do not in any way involve the cuts in holiday pay that have been made.
In the local government sector, agreements are likely to be reached only when the private sector papers have been signed and the increase percentages are clear.
Luukkainen predicts that OAJ’s working conditions, for example, will be agreed in January.
The percentage targets have not yet been revealed.
Luukkainen is also the chairman of Juko, an organisation for public-sector educated negotiators.
Luukkainen: Holiday pay cuts increase differences in earnings development
According to OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector employees is decreasing, while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing at the same time.
According to Luukkainen, the temporary holiday pay cut will further exacerbate differences in earnings development.
In Finland, the number of students per teacher must be determined
OAJ also points out that the equality of basic education must be ensured, as the differences between the best and worst performers are growing all the time.
According to the organisation, learning outcomes are deteriorating and disparities between pupils and between regions are constantly increasing.
Bruins players’ day lengthened as the NCAA reduced daily practice from two to one
It's almost 11:00 p.m. and a group of UCLA football players have been left to chat on the other side of the campus' new training grounds.
Some have taken off their jerseys, and their backs are shiny from sweat after the first day of training camp toil.
For many of them, a few minutes of conversation is a midday break.
After three hours of practice, the students return to their dorms to take their final exams, and the next morning, they gather at the Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 p.m.
“The next three days are going to be tough for these guys,” Bruins coach Jim Mora says shortly before Monday turns into Tuesday.
The university sports federation reduced the number of daily practice sessions from two to one. The change was intended to reduce the players’ workload, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the final exams will be held.
That’s why UCLA’s first three rehearsals started at 15:15 p.m. It was difficult to find space in the already full schedules of the players.
Limiting the number of training sessions to one per day means that there are more training days than before. The camp started almost a week earlier this year than last year, and this is the first time during Mora’s six-season coach season at Westwood, when the training sessions are held at the same time as the summer courses.
The drills are scheduled to be held 18 times before August 20, when the actual preparation for the season’s opening game begins: UCLA will face Texas A&M University in September.
Mora said he supported the NCAA’s rule change, although it made the players’ schedules even tighter.
“We’re really putting a lot of pressure on them for three or four days, and it’s very challenging,” Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work, they're great guys.
I think it'll be easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes the drills from outside after the camp. It’s not easy considering the direct view from the training grounds to the adjacent parking lot and Luskin Center, a high-class hotel that has already been bombarded with footballs flying over the safety net behind the goalpost.
Bruins players are expected to move into the hotel this coming weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when the rooms are available to outsiders.
“We have security,” Mora says.
"The concern is that people can book a room and shoot exercises on video from there. It is not an exaggerated concern.
The video of the exercises is paid quite a lot.
But we've got guards up there and in the parking lot.
We'll do our best.
I'm not going to worry too much about it.
We have a plan.”
Freedom in Rwanda
On Friday, presidential elections will be held in Rwanda, the winner of which is already considered to be clear.
Paul Kagame is officially seeking a third term, but in practice he has been influencing the country’s management since 1994.
At that time, the rebel group RPF stopped the genocide organized by extremists.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
Kagame has been criticised, among other things, for crushing the opposition and restricting freedom of speech.
He has also been accused of falsifying poverty statistics.
Kagame will run for a third term because of a change in the constitution that restricted his presidency to two terms.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a genuinely respected leader.
During his time, social reforms have been carried out in Rwanda and international investments have flowed into the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in uniting a country divided by genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to question whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
However, even Kagame has promised his people more freedom once the country is back on its feet.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook fights fake news by stepping up fact-checking
Facebook is planning to send potential fake news more often to independent fact-checkers and present the results below the original article. The world’s largest social network announced the matter on Thursday.
The company published on its website a statement that it will start using updated machine learning to identify fake news. Any fake news will be sent to fact checkers and the results may be published below the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the biggest disseminators of fake news, and many believe that the fake news affected the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue has sparked a political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombarded with fake news ahead of the May presidential election and Germany, which is preparing for the September election, supports a plan to fine social media networks if they do not remove hateful content quickly.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement published in Germany that fact-checking will be tested in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“People want to see which stories don’t pass the independent reviewer’s screening. They also want more background information so they can make more informed decisions about what they read and share,” Sara Su, product manager for Facebook’s news feed, wrote in the company’s blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test Related Articles and make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
The Birth of a Comic Book: The Story of a Castle
The small Scotney Castle in Kent County is now known from Squeeze's music video and as Margaret Thatcher's hideout from the 1970s and 1980s.
With 700 years of turbulent history behind it, this charming castle in the Bewlin River Valley is the subject of a comic book by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired author who has long been fond of old documents.
“I am delighted to be able to study a text written by a person who died more than 300 years ago,” Rhodes said.
"I feel a personal connection when I hold a letter in my hand."
The book A Castle in England, by Rhodes, tells the stories of families living in Scotland from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian period, each illustrated by a different artist, a promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first archival book. In 2014, he published Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, inspired by documents from the British National Library. The project was emotional.
"I was moved to tears when I saw the thumbprint in the letter, written by a double agent who worked for the Jacobites in the 18th century," Rhodes says.
"It was his fingerprints!
And the letters smell like smoke, because at that time fire was used as lighting.
Three centuries later, the scent makes the reader feel like he or she is on the spot.
I love the archives!
With the support of the National Trust and the National Council for the Arts in England, the writer was able to live in the castle for almost four months, which seemed too good to be true.
He spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures and rarities, such as hyena heads hung on walls and bottles in a moat for centuries.
He toured the ruins and estates of the old castle and talked with foresters, gardeners, and sometimes even artists illustrating the book.
In the evenings he took a scotch and began to write.
Scotney's more recent history is unknown, as the castle did not become a part of the National Trust until the death of its last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived about ten years later, the staff of the foundation was just beginning to go through the archives. Rhodes describes that the archives had been kept for hundreds of years by the same method: taking everything extra to the attic.
There were diaries in the archives, letters from the times of the English Empire and maps of who owned what. "You could imagine that land disputes are boring," Rhodes says. "Here, however, families fought even for one birch.
I thought we should let it go already.”
Some of the stories in the book progress from the castle to English history, such as The Labourer, about a man who joined the English Peasants' Revolt in 1381 shortly after the completion of the castle.
"The Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex mentions that there was a riot in the castle in 1380," Rhodes said.
“The English peasant revolt began in the same area, and it occurred to me that the revolt could begin with a riot.
“Perhaps these events are related?”
The other stories in the book are closely related to the history of the castle – such as The Priest, a story about a priest who was hidden by the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggler, on the other hand, tells the story of the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is said to have staged his own funeral by filling his coffin with stones (it was discovered years later when his tomb was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotney. "The men in the family seem to have been quite the villains. They were constantly going into debt and buying things they could not afford.
The men of the Darrell family solved their debt problem by marrying wealthy old women, and I see them as handsome men who could court heiresses."
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about Elämänmäki, a sanatorium that operated at the beginning of the 20th century.
Scotney Castle holds a special place in his heart.
“It was sad to leave,” he said.
“I didn’t want to go back to this damn place.”
The worst relations with Russia since the Cold War
Relations between NATO and Russia have clearly deteriorated, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its position in the Ukraine conflict.
“I think it’s fair to say that NATO’s relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War,” Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could pursue close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continuing instability caused by Russia in the region of Eastern Ukraine, NATO’s relationship with Russia has deteriorated significantly.
Stoltenberg said that NATO is still committed to ensuring that tensions do not escalate.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia to avoid escalation and a new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg’s remarks, US President Donald Trump noted that relations between the United States and Russia had deteriorated to dangerously low levels.
Trump called on the two countries to thank Congress, which last week approved new sanctions against Russia.
Vladimir Klitschko: Rematch with Anthony Joshua will not happen
Vladimir Klitschko, long-time world heavyweight champion of professional boxing, ends his career.
Klitschko, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
Klitschko, who won the gold medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, fought 69 times as a professional, winning 64 games.
He held various World Cup titles in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitschko lost the last two games of his career.
Tyson Fury beat him by points in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitschko faced Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost by knockout in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitschko were expected to meet again in November in Las Vegas.
However, Klitschko did not find the motivation for the match.
"I deliberately took a few weeks to make a decision to distance myself from the Wembley match," Klitschko said in a statement.
As an amateur and professional boxer, I achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I could never have imagined that I would have such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
Watch Klitschko's reasoning for his decision in the video.
Klitschko’s manager Bernd B<0xC3><0xB6>nte said in a statement that Klitschko’s decision to quit was difficult.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to quit if he no longer has enough motivation.
Therefore, this is definitely the right decision, Mr B<0xC3><0xB6>nte said.
Klitschko has been in a relationship with American actor Hayden Panettiere since 2009.
The couple have one child, Kaya, born in 2014.
Klitschko's older brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight champion of the world.
In 2008-12, the brothers dominated the World Cup titles of different federations at the same time.
The Finnish weathercrusher conjures up conditions: "Take a feeling"
Pole vaulter Minna Nikkanen has suffered from conditions during the summer outdoor iron season.
Nicky had trouble with the circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken the woman away from the feeling.
There are also unstable conditions at the World Cup in London.
Minna Nikkanen talks about the weather.
The circumstances have been against the pole vaulter Minna Nikkanen this summer.
I don’t want to blame the track, but it was inconceivable that I couldn’t even get the small poles to move properly,” Nikkanen said after the race in Innsbruck.
I have competed and trained here for God knows how many times and I have never experienced such a varied wind in this place,” Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmin Games.
This season it has been very difficult to standardise the jump, as the winds have been so unstable in practice, Nikkanen said at the Kaleva Championships.
We talked about the weather in London on Thursday.
It has been quite a challenge to get the technology together - is it cold or what?
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken me by surprise.
It makes no sense to consume energy in poor conditions.
Thanks to his 455 jump, he made it to the World Cup.
We've got 445 outside.
Not everyone in London is the same.
You have to be patient and wait for better weather.
The goal is to reach 460 on Friday.
Why not train abroad?
That won't be necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany.
I was able to jump and adjust the technique.
I probably should have done the same thing now.
Normally I have been able to exercise in the hall, now the hall has been closed.
What would be the ideal race?
It's 25 degrees.
Even a small wind will do, as long as it is constant.
An experienced ex-officer bullied politicians at Yle: "We don't have any room for distribution either now or for many years"
Despite the positive economic climate, Juha Sipilä’s government must keep the ice in its hat and beware of inflating the state budget with debt money, warns Erkki Virtanen, who has been preparing budgets for decades at the Ministry of Finance.
He said there is no division.
Yle interviewed Virta, who retired in 2015, in Ykk<0xC3><0xB6>saamu on Wednesday.
The construction of next year’s budget is just beginning.
Recently, politicians’ proposals on raising the guarantee pension, lowering the car tax and supporting electric bikes have come to the fore.
They mainly indicate that the elections are getting close, because when 10% of the state budget is financed by additional debt, we have no room for distribution either now or for many years.
I even think it’s cheating to talk about pay-as-you-go when you’re in debt,” Virtanen told Yle.
He added that all debt is owed to children.
Virtanen has a long experience in preparing state budgets: she started in 1978 as budget secretary at the Ministry of Finance and then worked as deputy head of the budget department and budget manager.
Before his retirement, he served as Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment.
Virtanen pointed out in an interview with Yle that the now forecasted economic growth of 3% is likely to be temporary.
All forecasters estimate that this is a peak from which we will start to go downwards as early as next year, and Finland is expected to grow by one per cent for decades.
Washington changes permanent residency rules
President Donald Trump announced in the media that the rules for a permanent residence permit, or Green Card, will be amended with a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, to tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and to limit family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans and backed by the president.
The bill is expected to be debated in two chambers of Congress.
“This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars in taxpayers’ money by changing the way permanent residence permits are issued to citizens of other countries.
It will also reduce chain migration and replace the current programme.
The new application process will benefit applicants who speak English, are able to support themselves and have skills that benefit our economy,” Trump said.
The Queen of Denmark’s husband doesn’t want to be buried in the same place as the Queen
Prince Henry does not want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
Prince Henry and Queen Margaret in April.
Queen Margrethe of Denmark, 77, and her husband Prince Henry, 83, are not buried next to each other.
Traditionally, royal couples in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The Royal House has today announced that Prince Henrik does not want to be buried in Roskilde Cathedral, the court said in a statement on Thursday.
According to BT, this is due to the prince’s dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It’s no secret that the prince has been unhappy with his role and title in the Danish monarchy,” Lene Belleby, head of communications at the court, said in a statement.
For the prince, the decision not to be buried with the queen is a natural consequence of not being treated as equal to his spouse.
According to the court, the queen has long been aware of her husband’s wish for a burial place and understands the decision.
A car on the road: the car almost hit the highway
Tommi had a partner and two small children on board.
They were not injured in the accident, but will not receive any money from the insurance if the other party cannot be reached.
The accident took place at Keimolanportti in Vantaa.
Archive photo of the Ring Road III construction site.
Tommi, from Vantaa, says his family miraculously survived a car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, his common-law wife Riina and the couple’s two small children were driving on the motorway at Keimolanportti in Vantaa towards Hämeenlinna.
From the Ring Road III junction to Hämeenlinnanväylä, a white car drove along the acceleration lane, which almost drove to the side of the family car, Tommi says.
Without it, the car would have come to Tom’s house.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it got out of hand,” Tommi says.
The family's car hit a railing at high speed.
The parents and two small children in the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is just under three years old, the other under one year old.
We were pretty lucky that nothing happened to us.
There was no one to drive by, even though there was heavy traffic.
The accident occurred at around 5:20 p.m.
According to Tommi, no one stopped to see them, and the family called the emergency services.
They got out of the car on their own.
Ambulance and rescue personnel arrived and the family was checked.
The car went into salvage.
Tommi says that she and her cohabiting partner have a low income, and they received a grant from the family to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without information about the other car, the family will not receive any money from the insurance.
That's why the family wants witnesses to tell them about the car, which is why the family drove into the railing.
We need a car every day.
It is difficult to take children to kindergarten and go to work without it, Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was white, an old car.
It was probably in the late 1990s or early 2000s.
He thinks the car's license plate number started with the SIG.
If the culprit is not caught, I don't know how we're doing financially, we're still going to have to count every cent.
Tommi hopes that anyone who has seen or knows anything about the incident is in contact with the police.
It is confirmed from the Itä-Uusimaa Police Department and the Central Uusimaa Rescue Department that they had a duty at the accident site on Tuesday evening.
The title and story were corrected at 9.15pm: Contrary to what was originally said in the story, according to Tommi, the other car did not come from the oncoming lane, but was to drive from the acceleration lane to the side of the family car.
The performance, directed by Lotta Jäppinen, deals with human relationships through humour - The Revealer will be seen at the Mihä? theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen, who is originally from Kouvola, brings her first directing to the Mihä? theatre.
The Revealer is a musical theatre performance about relationships and inadequacies that have gone wrong.
According to director Lotta Jäppinen, it still leaves a good feeling.
The subject is treated with humor.
You don’t have to deal with bad feelings, he said.
According to Jäppinen, the travelling summer theatre performance has been made with a tiny budget and a big, young heart.
The title of the performance challenges us to think about what people reveal about themselves when they meet a new person.
Is he pulling on a role or is he getting close to someone else's coat?
A non-fiction performance confuses fact and fiction
Jäppinen has both directed and dramatised the performance.
He is also responsible for the lights.
The presentation consists of the texts of the working group and there is no plot.
The director believes that although the performance draws on the thoughts of young people, it speaks to people of all ages.
Jäppinen emphasises that the Self-Exhibitor does not directly tell about his or her own or the team’s relationships.
Fact and fiction are mixed.
My own values will surely be reflected in the performance.
I don’t think that relationships are bad, but I also don’t think that relationships, especially relationships, are a prerequisite for happiness.
Many Learn From Divorced Parents
Jäppinen believes that the Self-Exhibitor draws a current picture of young adults living in Finland at the age of 100.
According to him, many have learned a lot about relationships from their parents, many of whom have separated.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
You don’t have to stay in a bad relationship.
The cast includes Minea L<0xC3><0xA5>ng, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes costume designer Ella Snellman.
The music is arranged by Jäppinen and Rokka.
The love of theatre in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola, studies theatre expression at the Turku University of Applied Sciences Arts Academy.
It's been two years, and we're looking at another one.
Jäppinen’s enthusiasm for theatre has started during his years in Kouvola.
He has worked as an assistant at the Kouvola Theatre and has acted at the Student Theatre in Helsinki and most recently at the Linnateatteri in Turku.
Leadership is becoming more and more important.
The self-revealer premiered last week on the Narri stage in Helsinki.
The performance, which will last for about 45 minutes, will also be seen in the future, at least in Jäppinen’s student city in Turku.
Self-revealing at the Kouvola Mihä? Theatre on August 4th at 7 pm and on August 5th at 2 pm and 7 pm.
Finnish Olympic champion recovers from motocross accident after one year of broken neck
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable force of nature as Janne Lahtela.
The ace of descent circled the world for hundreds of days a year for twenty years, chasing his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but Lahtela’s business continued.
He was not only a tireless intern, but also an experimenter of new species.
There are probably not many forms of exercise on earth that a Kemijärvi resident has not tried at least once.
It has inspired me to practice.
There is always something new, Lahtela says.
In the end, one hobby was to stop Lahtela completely.
In 2014, Lahtela was involved in a motocross accident.
As a result, his neck and both arms were broken.
I didn't work anywhere.
I spent a year licking wounds in my home, Lahtela says.
Lahtela had bad luck.
He also admits that age may have played a role in the crash.
Riding a motorcycle can sound crazy.
But I didn't go looking for boundaries.
It’s just so hard as a sport that a 40-year-old like me shouldn’t do too much!
After the accident, Lahtela was in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
He was the head coach of the Japanese freestyle team.
Lahtela started in the position immediately after the end of his career in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15 years old, I had to be in my seat.
I didn’t really do much, Lahtela says.
Even during her coaching, Lahtela often challenged her protege in piste and physics tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was so physically and mentally tired that even my own thoughts didn’t seem to make sense.
Not even in the sport.
It was good to be in place.
I really enjoyed it because I was able to do it for once.
The mandatory break inspired Lahtela to become Finland’s head coach.
Without stopping, he was afraid he would be burned out.
It’s easier to find places that are broken than undamaged!
Without the accident, I wouldn't have realized I needed so much rest.
Lahtela started as a coach of the Finnish freestyle team about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby to replace speed sports.
I traded motocross for disc golf!
It went off right away.
I spent seven hours a day throwing.
Even though Lahtela himself has always been a super-enthusiastic trainer, he does not demand that his coaches be like him.
I'm not forcing everyone into the same mold.
In our sport culture there is room to be unique and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and the mentality has always been one,” Lahtela says.
Sex robots are coming and we need to worry
It’s here: a report on technological developments in the sex robot industry – just when it was starting to feel like 2017 couldn’t get any weirder.
Yes, it is.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next 5-10 years.
“We need to start taking the rise of sex robots seriously,” said Noel Sharkey, a founding member and professor emeritus of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingernails.
“Sex robots are getting giddy, but they’re already selling quite a lot, and we’re going to see more of them,” Sharkey said at the report’s launch.
Sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots with warm-feeling silicone skin and features created with artificial intelligence that resemble human behavior.
The user can also customize the robot to his or her own preferences, from eye color to nipple shape and fingernail type and color.
What’s even more troubling is that robots have a “personality” that makes Stepford women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of a RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user’s preferences, such as shyness.
Roxxxy Gold robots from True Companion have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous and so on.
"Roxxxy Gold's personality adapts as fully as possible to the user's personality," the company's website states.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It can be tired, in the mood, or in the mood.
The proliferation of sex robots has many worrying features: they replace genuine human relationships, but even more dangerous is the oppression of women and outright rape fantasies when the user approaches a robot that has been programmed to be shy and resistant, for example.
True Companion compares the Roxxxy robot to a vibrator on its website:
"Women have vibrators, why shouldn't men have sex robots?"
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their generalization and development speaks to something darker and deeper in our culture: from the decline of gender equality to sexual intercourse, where submission is one option among others.
Of course, most men do not buy sex robots, and their popularity is still marginal, even though the FRR report indicated their growing popularity.
However, marginal phenomena tell a lot about the spirit of time.
And many start acting strangely or offensively only when the market allows it.
It is no coincidence that sex robots are becoming more common around the world at a time when women’s rights are under threat and there is a president in the White House who has bragged about harassing women.
In the television series The Handmaid's Tale, it is not its powerful imagery, such as pictures of bodies hanged and eyes dug out, that is the most disturbing aspect of how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
Attempts are being made to make sex robots as much like real women (in porn star proportions) as technically possible.
The developers of the robots want their skin to feel real and their movements to mimic human movements as much as possible.
However, their “personalities” are far from reality.
A robot cannot leave a relationship or a situation.
They have no will of their own and no history – nothing that suggests independence or violates the fantasy of total submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Slaves.
Police suspect two terrorist attacks were planned in Australia, group led by ISIS chief
The leader of the Islamic State group led a group of Australian men suspected of planning to carry a bomb on an Etihad Airways aircraft.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, one of the leading figures of ISIS had also sent bomb components to Sydney.
The bomb was reportedly scheduled to be taken on July 15, but the attempt was halted before security checks were carried out.
Police have not said why the company was stopped.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a device that emits toxic colorless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, such as a public transport.
Australian Deputy Federal Commissioner Michael Phelan says the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Because of suspected terrorist plots, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations continue.
The good sides of Trump?
Makes Mitt Romney look like the epitome of common sense
During Trump’s presidency, it has been said to the point of exhaustion that the strong division of voters has also broken up families at the everyday level.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, American newspapers gave advice on how to get along with relatives who voted for Trump.
We all want to burst our information bubbles.
Less attention has been paid to Trump’s ability to unite families.
I'm telling you this because my cousin visited me in New York this week, a left-wing poet living in Chicago who has long been at odds with the Republicans in our family.
He pointed out that a common enemy can have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all of my cousin’s acquaintances – including the Republican-leaning sibling with whom he has been arguing about politics for decades – are suddenly and unexpectedly on the same side.
At the dinner table, this is a good thing, but in a broader sense, it involves significant risks.
Trump has given the left a new lease on life, but the distorting influence of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and “normalization,” we’re talking about the frightening possibility that one day we won’t be able to stand up to his tricks anymore.
In the long run, there is an even more horrifying possibility that Trump will normalize right-wing Republicans, who suddenly seem reasonable compared to Trump.
I regretfully recall Mitt Romney’s restrained version of madness: a dog on the roof of a car, income tax of 14% (and we have seen his tax returns). Compared to Trump, they seem very mild offenses.
When Trump’s term is over, the next Republican presidential candidate just needs to be lucid, and that immediately seems like a significant improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our kid to the Central Park Carousel, which is the biggest carousel in New York's Parks Department and the best you can get in New York for three dollars without caffeine.
The carousel’s horses are huge, the characters in the middle – grotesque clowns and animals staring back in terror – are ominous, and the squeaking music in the background is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York’s landmarks fade into disappointment over time: the views of tall buildings start to tire, the city’s skyline becomes too familiar, and the reality of the city doesn’t match your dreams.
And still, after 35 years, I haven’t completely overcome the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage, but a large roundabout in North London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss-style pub, but it doesn’t count.
The Central Park Carousel, on the other hand, is still a strangely magical experience —so much so that two women aged two, one aged eleven, and two in their forties enjoy it immensely.
I would have given the carousel a full score if someone had asked for my assessment, but thankfully no one came to ask questions.
Instead, I was asked this week at a department store to rate my “payment experience” on a scale of one to five stars before putting my credit card in the reader.
The same thing in a cafe in my neighborhood, but there I am also given the opportunity to combine the estimate with a 15 percent service fee when I go to get my own coffee from the counter.
This slows down everyday interaction and puts pressure on the customer service representative to put their personality into the game in a situation where it is not needed.
The store clerk smiled apologetic when I tiredly gave my credit card experience five stars.
Shefki Kuqi was fired from Inter - "There was no confidence in the management"
FC Inter has today relieved Shefki Kuqi of his duties as head coach.
Former assistant coach Fabrizio Piccareta will be in charge of coaching.
The rest of the team will continue in their current roles.
Piccareta has previously worked as an assistant coach in Sunderland, England.
The 51-year-old Piccareta, who joined Inter’s coaching team in January, has completed a UEFA Pro licence last year.
Stefan H<0xC3><0xA5>kans, Chairman of the Board of FC Inter, is sorry for what happened.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the trust of the club’s management, so there was no other option,” H<0xC3><0xA5>kans said in a statement.
The Piccareta contract is valid until the end of the season.
Together with the rest of the coaching team, he will be responsible for tomorrow’s home match against HIFK.
According to reports, the team has been on fire since Thursday.
Kuqi told the players on Thursday morning that Piccareta and John Allen had been sidelined.
Kuqi and Piccareta clashed at Inter last Saturday against PS Kemi.
Linda Lampenius published a picture of her youth from the 1980s - would you recognize a serious violin student?
Violinist Linda Lampenius posted a youth photo on Instagram.
Several hashtags have been added to the picture, which suggest that the musician is a 16-year-old Sibelius Academy student.
Lampenius himself wonders when a young woman looks at the camera seriously.
A long time ago, seriously, he's sending a message.
If you don't see the picture, you can watch it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and also talked about painful topics.
About a year ago, he posted a couple of photos of himself on Instagram.
In one photo, she is seen 20 years ago, in another, she is posing now, as a mother of two.
In his caption, Lampenius reflects on his own growth as a human being and refers to the eating disorders he suffered when he was younger.
20 years ago and today...
I still look a lot like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I’ve learned to like myself and the way I look.
After the text he had added in English hashtags life, eating disorder, insecure, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating disorders in previous years.
At the age of 14, he was hospitalized for anorexia and orthorexia.
He was also diagnosed with bulimia, which was not discovered until 2006.
The healing began slowly.
In addition to therapy and peer support, Lampenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius Sent to Hospital for Chest Pain
This is the second time Pistorius has been taken from prison to the hospital.
Last year, he was hospitalized for incisions on his wrists, which prison officials say he received after he fell in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed the original death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by firing several shots through a toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a night-time intruder who was hiding in the bathroom.
Prosecutors have said they will appeal again, saying Pistorius’ six-year sentence is too lenient.
The Prosecutor General is planning to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal may be heard as early as this year.
If the appeal is upheld, Pistorius' sentence could be extended to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians have been arrested in Greece, the country's foreign ministry said, according to bTV.
Police arrested a group of unauthorized campers in Sithonia on the morning of 1 August, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
According to bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced the release of the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened up the rules on free campsites and are already imposing substantial fines on anyone camping outside designated areas.
Inspections will continue until the end of the period.
The court said it could impose a fine.
Neste's share is sinking - already -7.7%
Oil refiner Neste’s share has fallen by 7.7 per cent at around 11 a.m.
Its pre-tax profit decreased, but exceeded the forecast compiled by Inquiry Financial.
The stock exchange trade has started today slightly below freezing, both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
Shortly after the opening of the stock markets, the broad European Stoxx 600 index had declined by 0.2%.
After approximately half an hour of trading, the Helsinki Stock Exchange’s general index OMXH had fallen by 0.3 per cent to 9,509.48 points and the most traded companies’ OMXH25 had fallen by 0.3 per cent.
The exchange’s total turnover was 41 million euros, of which nine million was Neste’s earnings publication this morning.
Red Meat, Dairy, and Chocolate May Alleviate Irritable Bowel Syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like the nightmares of the digestive system.
However, a recent study suggests the opposite: a diet high in meat protein and dairy products may ease irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in the United Kingdom. It causes stomach cramps, swelling, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
People with irritable bowel syndrome are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products. However, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps the body to develop immune cells that strengthen intestinal tolerance.
According to Marco Colonna, the study’s director, the immune cells guard the swamp and ensure that no harmful microbes hiding in food enter the body.
Inflammatory cells are balanced by cells that strengthen tolerance. They protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to inflammation, IBS can result.
In the experiments, it was found that immune cells that strengthen the tolerability are present in mice with a specific bacterium in the intestine.
The bacterium in question needs tryptophan to start producing immune cells. Tryptophan is one of the building blocks of proteins.
"We found a link between the development of Lactobacillus reuteri and the development of cells that promote tolerance. Lactobacillus reuteri is part of the normal microbiome of the gut," says Professor Colonna.
"The more tryptophan was in the diet of mice, the more they had such immune cells."
If the same works in humans, a combination of Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and a diet rich in tryptophan can strengthen intestinal tolerance and reduce susceptibility to inflammation.
When investigating immune cells that strengthen tolerance, postdoctoral researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one group of mice had such cells, they did not have them in mice of the same species, which were kept separate from the other group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the mice’s gut microbiome, the normal gastrointestinal tract community of bacteria, fungi, and viruses.
When the mice’s intestinal DNA was examined, six species of bacteria were found in mice with immune cells, but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri was given to mice grown in a sterile environment that did not have the gut microbiome and did not develop immune cells, they began to develop immune cells.
The researchers wanted to find out how the bacteria affect the immune system by growing Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in liquids and transferring small amounts of liquid – without bacteria – to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells developed into tolerance-enhancing cells.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of mice, the number of tolerance-enhancing cells increased by about 50 percent. When the amount of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells fell to half of what it had been before.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same cells that strengthen tolerance as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether tryptophan by-products from Lactobacillus reuteri cause cells to develop in humans in the same way as in mice. However, tryptophan-related gene defects have been observed in IBS patients.
"We probably want to promote the development of such cells, because they regulate inflammation on the inner surfaces of the intestines," says Cervantes-Barragan.
"High levels of tryptophan combined with Lactobacillus reuteri may contribute to their proliferation."
Jose Mourinho says Manchester United got a "genius" after signing with Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United got a "genius" after signing with Nemanja Matic. The midfielder made his debut for Manchester United in a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
Matic, <0xC2><0xA3>40 million away from Chelsea, started with a 2–1 win in Dublin, United’s last pre-season match before a UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday, making an impression as a defensive midfielder against stars like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was not in the best shape yet, as he was not on the Asian tour of the Blue Shirts before the start of the season. He managed on the pitch for only 45 minutes – according to Mourinho, there has to be a change before the start of the Premier League season.
“He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and mindset make him a genius – he has the innate thinking power of football,” Mourinho said.
"We're going to help him be ready sooner rather than later."
In addition to Matic, newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were also starting the game at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to tweak his starting line-up for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, although the club has already done a "great job" by acquiring three of his four priority players.
"Three out of four - you have to thank the club for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."
Volleyball women teased Germany for two rounds
The Finnish women’s national volleyball team lost their fourth World Cup qualifier to Germany 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The standard of play in Germany is very high.
Their game was steady in every sector,” Finland’s head coach Tapio Kangasniemi said in a statement.
In the first two rounds, Finland kept her opponents close, but in the third round, Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads the group.
When we played patiently and aggressively enough in certain places, we were able to swing along,” Kangasniemi said.
Finland’s most effective player was Piia Korhonen with 14 points.
Finland, which has lost three games out of four, will face Slovenia on Sunday.
A Grand Jury Has Already Sent Challenges to Trump Jr.’s Russia Meeting
A grand jury in the United States has sent out subpoenas for a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
A grand jury convened by Special Counsel Robert Mueller has already sent out subpoenas for a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, known for her ties to the Kremlin.
This is according to Reuters, which also confirms the Wall Street Journal’s announcement on Thursday that a grand jury will be convened.
According to Reuters, a grand jury has sent out subpoenas related to a meeting between Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya, known for their Kremlin connections, that took place in the middle of the US presidential election in June 2016.
Also present were Donald Trump Sr.’s then campaign manager Paul Manafort and his son-in-law, current White House adviser Jared Kushner.
According to Reuters sources, the fact that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington means that the pace of the Russia investigation is intensifying.
The sources add that Mueller wanted a grand jury to help investigate Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election and whether the Trump campaign or his close associates cooperated with Russia.
The grand jury expands Mueller’s rights to gather evidence, send subpoenas, and force people to testify under oath.
A large jury is a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
The grand jury will weigh the evidence presented by the prosecutor during the investigation and decide whether charges should be brought.
British inventor microchips himself to get into his home and car with a flick of his hand
The British inventor was the first in the country to microchip himself so he could open the front door of his home, get into his office and start his car with a wave of his hand.
The microchip sits between the thumb and index finger of 33-year-old Steven Northam, who now offers a service to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with the technology from BioTeq, a Northam company.
Northam is working with Geoff Watson, consultant anesthesiologist at Royal Hampshire Hospital in Hants, Winchester, to ensure that the microchip meets medical standards.
The microchip uses the same technology as a microchip in cats and dogs and takes only 30 seconds to install.
Northam's attempt to make the locks on houses and cars compatible with the microchip will cost <0xC2><0xA3>300 to handle.
Northam is married and has one child, and he has installed microchip technology both in his home and in his BMW Z4, which starts when he puts his hand on the steering wheel.
White House exhibition cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The White House’s decision last month to fly a naval helicopter to the southern White House lawn for an event to showcase American production cost taxpayers $24,000, according to military documents obtained by TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is known as Marine One when the President is on board, and was the main attraction at an event at the White House on July 17, 2017 that showcased American building programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials visited products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter manufactured in Connecticut, the exhibits included a sailing boat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House military office had requested the helicopter to be on site by mission-specific order just about 36 hours before it landed on the southern lawn for an "exceptional" event, as evidenced by documents from the Navy's HMX-1 helicopter squadron.
"I just wanted to make sure you're aware of this because it's an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 unit wrote in an email the day before the event to his superior, who is a Navy Air Command Deputy Commander.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive at the southern turf at 7 a.m. on 17 July and the event would start at 3 p.m. The helicopter would only leave the site after the turf field was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. in the evening.
In addition, the message stated that if the helicopter were to be delayed from the White House, a second crew would be needed due to service hours restrictions.
The original crew was in the helicopter during the incident, and the unit’s security personnel were at the helicopter when it was on the ground.
The documents received by TIME magazine do not say whether a second crew was needed.
The U.S. Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 inquired whether the event was in violation of the law.
"One of our questions was whether there was a violation of the Hatch Act. We were told not to," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you can participate," the deputy commander replied.
Made in America was an official White House event, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political connotations.
At the event, the President spoke out in favour of the health care reform that was being discussed in the Senate at the time, as well as looser state regulation.
The use of the Marine One helicopter and the Air Force One aircraft for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them on their travels,
But using them only for photos is unusual.
Trump’s actions attracted attention in February, when Air Force One rolled into the background of the presidential campaign event in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticized the use of his predecessor’s presidential plane on Twitter.
“The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which showcases products made by American workers from American materials in all 50 states,” White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said in a statement.
HMX-1 crews regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and train on the southern lawn to bring the president to the White House to within centimetres.
While Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 training landings for the White House.
According to one official, flights to the Made in America event were part of the crew’s monthly training quota.
The unit’s helicopters also flew 11 hours on that day on “non-presidential support missions.”
The White House said there were no other costs to the taxpayer.
A Sikorsky spokeswoman said the company was not involved in organizing a helicopter demonstration on the White House’s southern lawn.
HMX-1 has no records of flights related to the President’s duties, and it is difficult to accurately estimate the costs of the event.
According to the Department of Defense’s 2017 hourly rate, the VH-3D helicopter’s replacement rate is $24,380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 records, flights from Quantico's Virginia base to the White House and back took a total of one hour.
According to the White House, the cost of operating the helicopter is significantly lower.
“Calculating the cost to taxpayers according to the level of compensation is misleading,” Walters says.
"The estimated level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called embedded costs, which are taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 study by RAND, the levels of compensation do not include personnel costs but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter.
"The idea is to showcase American production," Spicer said.
“I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to be involved in ensuring national security and therefore employing probably hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think that, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that many Americans have worked so hard for.
It is perfectly appropriate to point that out."
It’s not clear whether Trump was in the helicopter during the incident, but at least he sat down in the fire truck driver’s seat.
At the White House, Trump joked to the press about his Sikorsky squadron.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President. "I have three of them."
Lightning hits Vaasa railway - trains will have to be replaced with buses

Venezuela's Prosecutor General Demands Justice to Block Appointment of New Representative in Venezuela
Venezuela’s public prosecutor has sought a court decision that would prevent the appointment of a new representative body.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced that the council elected last Sunday is due to be appointed on Friday.
In a controversial vote, a representative body was elected to the country, which, among other things, can amend the country’s constitution.
Prosecutor Luisa Ortega said the impeachment decision had been requested because of allegations of electoral fraud.
Ortega has also opened an investigation into voter fraud.
He appointed two judges after a British company said the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only Maduro’s allies were nominated to the council, and the elected 545-member council includes Maduro’s son and wife.
In addition to changing the Constitution, the Representative Council can dissolve an opposition-led Congress and change laws.
Maduro is described as a dictator.
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition sees the constitutional amendment as a way for Maduro to strengthen its position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called him a dictator.
The European Union, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina, for their part, have announced that they will not recognise the new representative body.
Maduro says the new council is the solution to the country’s political and economic crisis.
The unrest in Venezuela has been raging for months.
Many people have been injured and more than 100 have died.
Venezuela plunged into an economic crisis as oil prices plummeted.
Many people cannot afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to demonstrate on Friday, when the new Representative Council is due to begin.
Russian man handed over by Finland sentenced to 4 years in prison in USA
A Minneapolis court on Thursday sentenced 41-year-old Maksim Senah to nearly four years in prison for complicity in a global computer scam.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of a U.S. demand.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on holiday in Finland.
He was arrested by the Finnish border authorities when he was returning home.
Finland handed Senah over to U.S. law enforcement in February 2016, despite protests from Russians, according to the AFP news agency.
In March of this year, he was found guilty of computer fraud that had generated millions of dollars in profits.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah will be deported after serving a prison sentence.
The Russian Foreign Ministry strongly criticized Finland after the arrest and said the man should not be extradited to the United States.
Finland and the United States were accused in the statement of the fact that the arrest was made in Finland without Russia’s prior knowledge.
Prosecutors said Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to fish for usernames and passwords.
The scammers then used the data to redirect internet traffic, which was used to create click fraud and spread spam.
According to Kenneth Blanco, acting director of the Department of Justice’s criminal division, the case shows that the United States is also capable of pursuing cybercriminals operating in other countries.
We have the ability and desire to identify, find and bring them to justice,” Blanco said in a statement.

Narcos Season 3 trailer: Pablo Escobar is out of the picture, so the Cali cartel will star in the Netflix hit series
Although the killer of Pablo Escobar was revealed in the second season of Narcos, the Netflix series is definitely not over.
The streaming service has already confirmed that the series will be shown in the third and fourth seasons. A trailer for the third season has been released, introducing the new villains of the series.
In season three, the DEA has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the world’s richest drug-trafficking organization.
The organization, run by four godfathers, operates "like a Fortune 500 company," except there's a little more corruption and violence by the authorities.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) leads the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) manages the connections to Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In the recently released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pe<0xC3><0xB1>ana, who recruits American and Colombian police officers to fight the war on drugs.
New faces include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos begins on September 1.
Kari Kola creates an exceptional work of light art in Paris
The light artist Kari Kola from Joensuu (kuavssa) will carry out an exceptional light work in honour of the UN’s first Day of Light in Paris on 16 May next year.
Kola makes a light art piece called Day and Night in Paris.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The work illuminates the UNESCO headquarters in Fontenoy building and the Globe monument in front of it.
In my work, I want to emphasize not only light but also darkness.
Today, light pollution in cities with millions of inhabitants is a major problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
With the help of my art, I can make the things I consider important concretely visible, says light artist Kari Kola in his work.
I am very honoured to be invited to participate in the first International Day of Light and to make light art a part of the theme day,” Kola continues.
Kari Kola participated in the opening ceremony of the Year of Light in 2015, when he illuminated the UNESCO headquarters in honour of the anniversary.
I feel very privileged to be able to re-create my art at UNESCO headquarters,” Kari Kola says.
The work may even expand significantly.
We will announce this later this autumn,” Kola continues.
The aim of the International Day of Light is to highlight the importance of light for humanity and to raise people’s awareness of the fields of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Day of Light will be celebrated at UNESCO headquarters in central Paris on May 16.
Two men fight in shopping centre parking garage in Espoo
Two men got into a fight in the Iso Omena shopping centre parking garage in Espoo on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute started when one of the parties accidentally drove in the prohibited direction.

After that, he hit the back of the car.
In the initial speech, the man has admitted that he caused the damage and that he did the wrong thing.
A question mark from Timo Soini: "Then came the flood"
Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini published a blog post on Thursday with a question mark.
The book is short, only two sentences long.
In my time, the party grew from zero to a government party of thirty-seven MPs.
After that came the flood, now everything floats, Soini writes.
There are references to 18th century France.
The parable of the Flood is known to have been used by King Louis XV or his mistress, Madame de Pompadour.
Depending on the interpretation, the words "after us the flood" or "after me the flood" have remained in the history books.
Afghanistan’s democracy depends on women’s political role
The elections will only be representative if they allow all members of society, including women, to vote, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, interim head of the UN relief mission, said that hundreds of women are running for election to the provincial councils, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overemphasized," Haysom said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can only be genuinely representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
The presidential and provincial elections in Afghanistan will be held on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban have made threats about the elections at a time when international forces are moving into an advisory role.
This year's elections will be the first time that power has been transferred peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that women's contribution will strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Election Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

Flooding of certain types of tourists threatens the culture of the region
The authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
The locals are particularly angry at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it "eat and flee" tourism: the destination is only a few hours away and a large number of people rush through the sights.
Venice is stifled by quick day trips to the city by tourists.
The narrow streets are difficult to navigate, and the fine squares are so crowded with visitors that the people of Venice no longer fit in.
They have been forced to move further and further away from the historic centre, while hotels have been replaced by homes.
The New York Times and The Guardian have written about the problems of tourism in Venice.
Authorities are considering restrictions on the number of tourists.
They call the current phenomenon low-quality tourism.
When arriving on a large cruise ship, you are given two or three hours.
You follow the flag-holding guide from Piazzale Roma to Rialto Bridge and St. Mark’s Square, and turn back, says Italy’s Culture Minister Dario Franceschini, describing the current and problematic tourism.
The beauty of Italian cities lies not only in the architecture, but also in the operation of the place, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of the identity of cities.
St. Mark's Square is also one of the most popular places to visit in Venice's historic centre.
St. Mark's Church is located on the edge of the square.
The anger of the locals is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
Only 50,000 locals live in the historic centre of Venice.
In 1951, the population was about 175,000.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians protested against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has undermined their quality of life, destroying the environment and driving residents away.
About 2,000 residents leave each year.
If this continues, in a few years Venice will be nothing but tourists.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says Carlo Belframe, who organised the demonstration.
The equation is a difficult one, as ships bring much-needed income to Venice and create the need for jobs in a wide range of sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, it is planned that the cruisers would go further away from the historical centre.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, thinks that the situation would certainly change if the Venetian administrative region, where Venice is also located, were given more power to decide its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
About 20-30 million tourists visit Venice every year.
Are you driving towards Kuopio?
Traffic jams on motorways lasting several kilometres
On the highway between Kuopio and Siilinjärvi, the lane going north has been congested for kilometres from Thursday afternoon work during the return traffic.
Motorway retreading work is carried out in the area, which slows down traffic, says Savon Sanomat.
For road works, there is a 50 km/h speed limit instead of the usual 120 km/h.
Even in the 50 km restricted area, traffic had progressed at a walking pace in some places on Thursday afternoon.
On Thursday afternoon, the roadworks proceeded on the Siilinjärvi side near the statue of the golden deer.
I get along fine without that kind of attention.
A 23-year-old runner has been forced to notice the public’s curses.
Amalie Iuel has published stunning photos of herself in the Grand Canyon.
Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has become a popular athlete in her present home country Norway, not least because she broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in 400 metres in March by turning 51.81.
A month later, he improved the 400 m hurdles to a record time of 55.38 in Norway.
Avidly using social media, Iuel soon discovered that fame and publicity have their downsides.
Men around the world began sending Iuel pictures of their genitals, apparently in the hope that the young runner would be interested in them.
Iuel was forced to close his Snapchat account from outsiders.
I got a lot of "grotesque" photos from people I didn't know, so I had to make my account private," Iuel told VG.
In an interview with VG, Iuel did not want to specify exactly what kind of images he received.
You can probably guess, he laughed.
It’s nice to get feedback after the race, but I get along well without any other kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, his father is Danish-Norwegian.
The Iuel family moved to Norway when Amalie was two years old.
When Amalie was 12, the family moved to Namibia, then Pakistan, because of her father’s job.
Then came Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, before returning to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed his Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains with three coaches: Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to debate than the United States.
In the United States, coaches don’t ask questions, they just give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to interact personally with the athlete, Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds the Norwegian record in 400 metres and 400 metres hurdles.
Foot injury put snowboarder Janne Korvi's entire career in jeopardy - now participating in the World Championships: "It's nice to not get hurt anywhere"
Now it's been nice to count, since it hasn't hurt at all!
One of the most successful snowboarders in Finland, Janne Korpi, 31, has been able to enjoy his beloved sport again this season.
Last summer, his career was at stake.
In January Korpi had been forced to the operating table by a leg injury, and his leg was not healing.
The hand had also been hit in the race.
In the summer I didn’t know what I was doing, if I was going to skate or not.
Sponsorship deals were on the break and many things were open, Korpi says.
But that's what they say. Things tend to work out.
The leg healed, the sponsor extended the contract for two years, and the blood began to draw again on the slope.
After that, the decision was easy.
I knew that the first time I went out in the snow.
I was like, "Damn, this is so much fun, let's do a couple more seasons."
Korpi didn't get to count properly until September-October, but after a long counting break, just working out painlessly has been a big deal.
Only a few races have been played by Korpi.
I don't mind.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of snowboarding for Korve.
I've never counted for one race.
I think it’s frustrating to aim for four years at one race, and then you’ll be feverish that week.
I don’t think so, Korpi says.
Today Korpi competes in the halfpipe of the World Championships in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Even though individual races don’t like him when it comes to snowboarding, he always gets excited when competing in a tough team.
According to Korpi, the appreciation of the International Ski Federation has increased in recent years, even though some of the skaters chose the Norwegian X-Games to be held at the same time.
Yes, these are important races, the visibility is big.
However, I think that appreciation always depends on the conditions and the level of the competition.
Korpi is the oldest athlete in the Finnish 12-man team in Sierra Nevada.
The team’s youngest players, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpea.
It’s nice to see younger friends.
I remember when I was at that stage too, when everything was new and I was so sickly excited about everything.
It will give you a new lease of life, he thought.
I'm still keeping up with the slope, but otherwise I'm not, there's a lot of energy in my friends!
In the background of his career in rafting, Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career.
The son of director legend Pekka Korvi is addicted to horse racing: the rider has his own racehorses, for which he makes training programs.
When I'm on the road all the time, I don't have time to be in the mess.
But every day I look at at least the results of the treatment and usually some departures as well, Korpi says.
According to Korvi, trotting guidance and training are a potential career plan when the snowboarding career comes to an end.
I don’t plan that far, but at least it’s a good option.
I feel like I’m learning it along with snowboarding.
I'm trying to keep up with the times and develop, in the summer I might even drive some departures.
If it's my future profession, then it's not difficult to start it, since it's already inside the sport.
Also included is the Elitloppet race cruise with host Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The two have chartered a cruise ship, which will head to Stockholm for the Elitloppet race in late May.
Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to revive the old tradition.
The cruise has sold well and people have been excited.
We are at the point where there is no bankruptcy.
There are still a few months left, let’s hope we can get the ship full,” Korpi says excitedly.
Attendo’s nursing home project to Kitee has surprised everyone
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new 41-seat nursing home for the elderly to be built in Kitee.
The 1,700-square-metre building is expected to be completed next summer on the other side of Terveystie, the neighbour of the health centre.
A common question on the kite is where the new care unit has enough customers, because now, during the Siun sote, many private care homes are short of customers.
Anne Flink, Regional Director of Care Services at Attendo, comments that in the future, Kitee will have more demand not only for alternatives but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are options, freedom of choice works better, Flink says.
Attendo acquired private nursing homes Kanervikkola and Eerika from Kitee last year.
The deal was for business, but the property is reportedly under a five-year lease.
Flink says Attendo doesn’t have an acute need to move functions out of these spaces.
More on this later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of McVitie's brand Scottish plant
The union is seeking confirmation from McVitie's biscuit makers of their long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
According to the Scottish branch of the General Trade Union of Great Britain (GMB), the company has not announced its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The factory, which manufactures Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, has more than 500 employees.
Pladis, the company that owns the McVitie's brand, said it had invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the plant in recent years.
The company added that employees and union representatives would be "certainly the first to be told" if there were to be changes in operations.
In a letter to the plant manager, GMB urges the company to “respond to the concern that no funding has been allocated for the modernisation of production lines.”
Drew Duffy of the GMB is deeply concerned about the lack of clear information from the plant manager about Tollcross’s business needs and future investment plans.
"Families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce is highly concentrated in the local community and the Glasgow metropolitan area. The factory is a significant source of employment in the high unemployment and low income area.
From the perspective of jobs, wages and livelihoods, Brexit, rising living costs and continued cuts in production, East Glasgow is in dire need of successful McVitie's production."
According to a spokesman for Pladis, the factory manager had only received the trade union letter the day before and the company responds directly to the letter because it appreciates the constant interaction with workers and trade union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, where we openly discussed a number of issues.
Among other things, we discussed with our employees that, like other companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain market, we are constantly evaluating all our businesses and locations to maintain our competitiveness.”
In recent years, the company has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the Tollcross plant, particularly in its production lines and improving operations.
“We are aware of Tollcross’s long history as a production facility and will be the first to tell employees and trade union representatives if we intend to make any changes to the factory.”
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar’s transfer three years ago?
LaLiga may regret interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up on Neymar after paying <0xC2><0xA3>189m to close the deal, but did PSG warn Barcelona of a record move three years ago?
The sensational move is the most talked about event of the summer. The team of the French Ligue 1 football league is ready to break the world record for transfer amounts. The previous record was less than half: it was created when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for a transfer amount of <0xC2><0xA3>89 million.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive footballer in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world, with PSG offering him more than <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 a week after taxes.
Barcelona are known to be furious about PSG's actions and the way Neymar has left the club, a source close to Barcelona says the club has taken very good care of Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the PSG chairman warn the football world about this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced their interest in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned PSG’s top looking clubs.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they go after our players, we will become their opponent and we will contact their players," he said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they are looking for our players, they will face the consequences.”
Barcelona seems to be guilty of just this: it expressed its interest in PSG midfielder Marco Compared earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances, and it may well be that Barcelona will lose its star player Neymar as a result.

The White House admits that the two phone calls mentioned by US President Donald Trump never happened, according to the New York Times.
Trump’s phone calls with both the Mexican president and the leader of the scout organization have turned out to be made up.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had been made.
But he said Trump wasn’t lying.
According to Sanders, many of the scout leaders spoke to Trump personally, and with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump had spoken at the G20 summit in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty strong accusation.
“Those conversations happened, they didn’t just happen over the phone, they happened face-to-face,” Sanders said.
The speech to the scouts provoked outrage
Trump said on Monday that the Mexican president had called him and praised Trump’s success in eradicating illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto said few will come across Mexico’s southern border because they know the trip will stop at the U.S. border anyway.
The Mexican government issued a statement on Wednesday saying that the call had not been made.
On Tuesday, Politico released a full version of Trump’s interview with The Wall Street Journal.
In it, Trump extolled his speech at the National Scouting Association’s major meeting in West Virginia.
I got a call from the head of the Boy Scouts, he said it was the greatest speech ever given to them.
“They were very grateful,” Trump said.
On Wednesday, the organization said it was not aware of any calls to Trump from any of its leaders.
According to the statement, Michael Surbaugh’s earlier statement, in which he had apologized to the Boy Scouts for Trump’s speech, speaks for itself.
Trump’s speech at the Scout meeting was highly controversial, as it was unusually political in nature.
Among other things, he praised the results of last autumn’s presidential elections.
