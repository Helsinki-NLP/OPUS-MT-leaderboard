I take the train to work every day.
I talked to Tom a few times.
It's up to you.
He came out of nowhere.
She'll be better off with your sister.
It goes hand in hand with the love I have for you.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
The price is two euros.

I'm clearly upset.
It's not broken.
I wasn't sick.
That didn't help much.
The snow did not stop.
The snow did not stop.
I don't care if you come.
That's all right.
It doesn’t matter who started it and why.
It doesn't seem that complicated anymore.
That doesn't seem right.
I teach Chinese.
It's like they've been cast on me.
I slowly realized that I misunderstood him.
It snowed the day before.
Thank you so much for coming.
Thank you for your trust in me.
This happened at the beginning of last week.
This happened on the day of our marriage, darling.
There had to be a reason for this.
It happened suddenly.
It happened while he was out.
It's happened to me several times.

It doesn't taste good.
It has its own value.

I thought I saw a rat.
I think I have time to do that before Tom gets here.
I think it's better that way.
I think it's fair.
It is very unlikely, in my opinion, that you will be able to do it yourself.
I think he's leaving.
I think it's time for a career change.
I feel like it's time to take a break.
I think that's unfair.

I'm thinking, so I'm drinking.
I think, therefore I exist.
I don't think there's any point in trying to convince him.
I think they did a great job.
I suppose that's exactly what Tom wants.

I thought I was going to go with him.
I thought I knew him.
I thought it might be worth something.
I thought it was clear what I wanted.

I thought Tom was still living in Boston.
I thought you trusted me.
I thought Tom was coming.
I thought Tom was still at home.
I thought you were him.
I threatened to kill the neighbor.
You're hurting me!
That hurts, stop it.
I'm under the influence.
He was a big influence on me.
It's dangerous!
This is a historical play.
It is difficult to put into practice what has been said.
It's hard to please everyone.
It's hard to please everyone.
I have my doubts about whether it will work.
It's getting really late.
He's gone.
We're half an hour after midnight.
Some people are hard to understand.
It’s time to start a new business.
It is important to promote our language in every possible way.
It's basically your fault.
He's in the kitchen.
It's amazing.
It's noon.
This is my bedroom.
We have to prepare for the future.
You need a good rest.
It's never too late to learn.
It's good to see you again.
It is not easy to solve the problem.
The smoke detector shall not be deactivated.
That's not the best way.
It's not the right thing to do.
It's no exaggeration to say he's a genius.
It's no secret.
I'm not the one Tom has a problem with.
It's not that expensive.
This isn't the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not working.
Maybe he's lying.
It's not polite to talk with your mouth full.
It's snowing.
It's still moving.
Wow, it's really bad weather today.
It's so expensive.
Thirty meters long.
Time to go to bed.
It's too easy for him.
It's up to you.
This is useful information.

It'll be dangerous.
It'll be dark when we get home.
It'll be ready when it's due.
He'll be ready when he needs to be.
It will take some time to get used to wearing glasses.
It'll wear off soon.
It'll work if I switch the polarities.
As a result, it looks bigger.
It's looking good.
Looks like I'm not needed here.
You could use a shave.
You don't seem to be feeling well here.
You seem to have thought of everything.
That makes me sad.
That's what counts.
That could be a long time.
Maybe it's a trap.
This could save your life.
Maybe we'd enjoy trying it.
I might be late.
It needs to be washed.
It has to mean something.
It must have been love.
It was definitely stolen.
It has to be repaired.
It never existed.
It never should have happened.
I lied to him even though I didn't want to.

I have a question for you, too.

It's done.
I was on Route 58.
I was sure you were on our side.
Yesterday I took my cat to the animal hospital.
I took off my shoes.
I totally forgot.
It would probably be cheaper elsewhere.
It was raining yesterday morning.
It rained yesterday.
It's raining a lot.
I train for two hours a day.
I traveled all over Russia.
I traveled across the United States.
Actually, it works.
That's really sad.
I did everything I could to keep him alive.
I tried to forget.
I was trying to help Tom.
I'd trust him with my life.
I'm trying to stay informed.
I'm trying to collect my thoughts.
That's a nice flag.
Big-haired cat.
It's a little early for drinks, isn't it?

It's completely dark outside.
It's all mine.

This is all your fault.
It's 7:00.
It's already in progress.
It's 10:00 at night.
One of my dreams has always been to live by a stream.
It's always the same song.
An environmental disaster.
It's a dirty business, Watson, a dirty, dangerous business, and the more I see it, the less I like it.
That's too bad.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Too bad Tom's leaving.
That's a pretty big stick.
It's a rumor.
It's freezing.
This is as much art as it is science.
That's all in the past.
He's at school.
It is a very dangerous sport, where even a small mistake can lead to serious injury.

It's deep here.
This is so good.
It's done!

It seems to me that you are honest.
It seems to me that you're wrong.
Looks like we're going to have a special guest.
It's embarrassing to be late for a date.
That's exactly what they want.
Expensive.
It is fair to get the same pay for the same work.
It's far from perfect.
It's far from ideal.
That's for you.
You know, it's funny.
It's coming over.
It's getting serious.
It's gonna be a rough winter.
It won't be easy.
It's lucky to see a shooting star.
It's good to be gay.
Good for studying.

It's hard to put into words.
It's hard to put into words.
It's hard to steal from a thief.
Hauntingly beautiful.
He has a disproportionately large head.
Tall.
The kids should be in bed.
Stop throwing money at me!
It's hotter than usual tonight.
That's illegal.
This is important.
It is important for parents to be on the same side when it comes to parenting.
It is important to help those in trouble.
That's impossible for me.
You have to suffocate in here.
You can't breathe in here.
It's impossible to live up to your expectations.
It's impossible to meet your terms.
I don't know what tomorrow will bring.
It's incredible, you know?
It's inevitable.
That's inspiring.
It's just a hunch.
Just a little further away.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets in trouble again.
It's just a phone.
It's just that I don't want to die today.
It's really hard.
That's pretty important.
It's really nice of you to give me a ride home.
That's nice of you to say.
It's getting late.
It's laundry day.
It's like an undersea field, and the turtles and the rays and the sharks above it, like flying creatures.
It's locked.
It's me again.
It's me again, Tom.
That's me!
That's me.
It's pathetic how he lives.
It's too cold to swim.
That's my horse.
This is my life!
This is my life!
That's my problem.
This is my suitcase.
Now it's my turn.
It's never too late to be what you could have been.
It's none of your business.
That's not a bad idea.
It's not a bank.
It's not as crazy as it sounds.
It's not complicated at all.
It's not enough.
That's not gonna happen.
It is not your job to change Egypt.
It's not mine.
It's not my fault.
It cannot be negociated.
It's not that far.
It's not that simple.
This isn't the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not what it looks like.
What matters is not what you do, but how you do it.
There's no need to complain about it.
I wasn't talking to you.
I wasn't talking to you.
I'm not talking to you.
There's no point in confessing to a priest if you don't repent.
There is no point in dwelling on the past.
It's snowing.
It's obviously broken.
It's clearly impossible.
It's obviously weird.
It's obviously very painful.
I don't mind if some people think I'm a peasant.
It's okay to be gay.
“It’s been three months, and Tom says he’s fluent in French.” “Yeah, he’s at the top of his stupid stuff.” “What a peak?” “The Dunning-Kruger effect.”
It's only three days.
He's on the other side of the park.
That sounds great.
It's over, isn't it?
It's all over.
It's personal.
It's pouring like a tub of water.
He spreads his wings.
It's pretty amazing.
That's pretty convincing.
It's pretty simple.
It is quite obvious that the aim of these misanthropic theories is to denigrate the working class, to absolve imperialism of the responsibility for the bloody wars it instigated, and to sow the seeds of the idea that endless wars are caused by man’s inherent aggressive tendencies.
It's very urgent.
It's raining in my heart.
There are few large gardens in Japan.
It's real, isn't it?
That's a really big deal.
It's over there.
It's rude to ask someone how much they make.
They say Czech girls are beautiful.
They say they're leaving Tokyo soon.
Bullshit!
It's just disgusting.
It's snowing in here.
It's snowing in Boston right now.
It's so good to be home.
It's still moving.
It's suicide.
This is technically possible.
This is the best book I've ever read.
It's the least I can do.
Theoretically possible.
It's the same for everyone.
Same old problem.
That still needs to be answered.
It's time to get out of here.
Time to get out of here.
It's time to go.
Time! Time!
It's time to fix the problem.
I should have my hair cut.
Time to rest.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
It is high time we did something about it.
Tom's birthday is today.
It's Tom's decision.
Tom’s words are against Mary’s.
It's too dark to play ball.
It's precious to me.
It's too hot for that now.
It's too late.
It's too late to worry about that.
It is a typical autumn day.
The cold sucks.
It's ugly, it's bright yellow and it doesn't harmonize with anything, but at least you won't be run over in the dark.
It's under the table.
Maybe he's not as stupid as you think.
It is unlikely that anything serious will happen.
It's up to them now.
It's up to you whether we go there or not.
She's very attractive.
It's very boring.
It's very cold in this room, isn't it?
It's very disturbing.
It's very entertaining.
It costs a lot to live here.
That's very kind of you.
It's very white.
It's hot.
That's what we agreed.
It's your only chance.
It takes about 10,000 hours of learning to master a language.

It caught everyone off guard.
It took exactly an hour.
It took me a long time to write this book.
It took me over a month to recover from the cold.
It took Tom a long time to pick out a pair of shoes.
It took a long time, but I finally found it.
I turned into a little alley.
I flipped.
I'm turning left.
It was a beautiful summer day.
It was a difficult time.
It was a friendly competition.
It was a mistake to do so.
It was fun.
It was a dark night.
It was a real challenge.
That was a stupid question.
That was a stupid idea.
It was a tragic accident.
It was a really good meal.
It was a waste of time for all of us.
It was so weird.
It's been a wonderful day.
It was a wonderful evening.
It was chaotic.
It was clearly very enjoyable.
We had fun last night.
It was hard at first.
It was hopeless.
It was hot and wet.
It was hot, and the weather was humid.
It was just a trip.
It was just too easy.
I told you that.
That's what I wanted.
It was almost pitch black.
This was shortly before John had an idea. John always knew a way out of seemingly hopeless situations.
This was not a very interesting novel.
It wasn't easy for me.
It was not easy to keep my promise.
That was an under-the-belt hit.
It wasn't interesting.
I wasn't the one who slammed the door.
It wasn't my fault.
It wasn't intentional.
It wasn't our fault.
It wasn't so bad.
This isn't the first time they've done this.
It wasn't Tom.
It was a joke.
I only knew his true intentions when I met him.
It didn't hurt.
It rained last night.
It was kind of weird.
That was really interesting.
It was really fast.
It was really sad.
It was a success.
That was great.
That's all I could think about.
It was the worst pain I have ever experienced.
Tom was next.
They kept it completely secret.
He was unsure if he would marry her.
It was urgent.
In a few days, it'll all be over.
It'll all be over in a few days.
This will all be over in a few days.
It takes five or ten years for the technology to be completed.
This will grow back.
That's what's gonna happen.
It's going to rain for a week if it doesn't stop tomorrow.
This will threaten the well-being of the city.
We don't have to come back tomorrow.
There's no need to do that anymore.
It won't take much time.
It worked beautifully.
Works perfectly with your iPhone.
That would be dangerous.
