Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear they will find themselves on the Muppet Show
Some members of the National Assembly were shocked by the proposal to change their address to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The alarm was raised when the Assembly was renamed the Welsh Parliament.
Now Members from different political backgrounds are all afraid that the new title could make them a laughing stock.
A Labour MP said his group was concerned that their new name would rhyme with the words "Twp" and "Pwp".
Not for the sake of our Welsh readers: in Welsh, twp means simple and pwp means poop.
A member of the Plaid party said the whole group was “unsatisfied” and suggested alternatives.
One Conservative MP said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that the MWP was only one jump away from the "Muppet".
It is worth noting here that in Welsh the letter "w" is pronounced in the same way as in Yorkshire English "u", i.e. MWP is pronounced "map".
The position of the National Assembly Committee responsible for the drafting of the bill introducing the name change is as follows: “As regards the titles of the members of the National Assembly, the final decision is, of course, in the hands of the deputies.”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 allowed the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation proposing the name of the Welsh Parliament, which received broad support.
As regards the title of MEPs, the Commission prefers the title Welsh Parliament Member and its acronym WMP, but the public consultation preferred the MWP alternative.
The MPs are coming up with more and more alternatives, but the agreement is rather difficult, which is causing problems for the Speaker of the National Assembly, Elin Jones, who will have to submit a bill on name changes in the coming weeks.
The reform law will also affect the functioning of the National Assembly on other points, including the disqualification of deputies and committee structures.
Deputies will be able to cast their final vote on their own title during the debate on the bill.
Macedonia to hold referendum on changing the country’s name
Citizens will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of the country to “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The referendum aims to end a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, a province of which is also called Macedonia.
Athens has long maintained that its northern neighbour has a territorial claim to its name, and has repeatedly objected to its application for EU and NATO admission.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov himself is opposed to the referendum on the change of name and will not take part in it.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply a compromise that must be made for their accession to the EU and NATO.
Churches in Harlem are in a difficult situation, the bells of St. Martin also stopped ringing
“In the past, as I hear from older people, there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“There are none today.”
As he says, the disappearance of the bars would be understandable.
“Nowadays, people go out in a different way,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the community lounges that people go to on a daily basis.”
As far as churches are concerned, Adams fears that the sale of church property will not live up to the expectations of the leaders, “and in time they will be back where they started.”
He adds that the place of churches will be occupied by residential buildings whose residential community also does not help the fate of the remaining churches.
“The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and this will further expedite the final closure of the churches, as it is unlikely that the majority of those who move into these apartments will join the community.”
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a black city – the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist church moved out of the church in the 1930s.
which was then taken over by a nearby black congregation.
St. Martin’s Church has been taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson – the Reverend is known for leading a boycott against his business owners on Harlem’s shopping street, 125th Street, which refuses to hire blacks or sell black goods.
In 1939, a fire caused severe damage to the building, but during the renovation, the carillon was built on the order of the community led by Reverend Johnson.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson at St. Martin’s Parish, proudly called the chimes “the bells of the poor.”
According to the expert who performed the chime in July, this chime is “a cultural heritage”, “an irreplaceable instrument of historical significance”.
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also noted that it was the first chime in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who joined the larger chime at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin has not hired anyone to replace him.
In recent months, a difficult situation has developed in St. Martin with the participation of architects and entrepreneurs, who have been involved partly by the secular leadership of the church and partly by the episcopal office.
The presiding body of the parish, the parish council, turned to the bishop’s office in July in writing, complaining that the office would “transfer the costs” to the council, even though the council did not participate in the selection of architects and contractors contracted by the office.
Some members of the community complain about the lack of transparency around the office.
A 13-year-old Californian boy was attacked by a shark while fishing for crab
According to official reports, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while fishing for shrimp on the opening day of the crab season in California on Saturday.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. on Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends had been scuba diving for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he noticed a boy screaming for help, and rowed to help him get out of the water.
At first, Hammel thought the boy was just excited because he caught a crab, but then realized that the boy was shouting, “He bit me!
He bit me!"
“His shoulder was torn from his collarbone,” Hammel recounted what he had seen when he approached the boy.
“I started yelling for everyone to get out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water,’” he said.
The boy was taken by air ambulance to the Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently being treated in critical condition.
The species of shark that attacked the boy is not known.
As rescue captain Larry Giles told the press, a few weeks earlier, a shark had been spotted in the area, but it was found that it was not a dangerous species for humans.
Captain Giles also said the boy suffered traumatic injuries to his upper body.
The authorities closed the beach between Ponto Beach (Casablad) and Swami (Ecinitas) for 48 hours for safety reasons.
Giles says there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury’s expands into the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s would compete with retailers and wholesale-style toiletries tables with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains.
As part of its <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion rise in the UK beauty market, which continues to grow in the wake of declining fashion and household goods sales, the chain is testing larger piper stands in 11 stores across the country, and if successful, they will be available in new stores from next year.
The strengthening of the toilet line is due to the fact that stores are trying to fill the shelves previously occupied by TVs, microwaves and household items in different ways.
Sainsbury’s said it will double its offering to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which it is offering for the first time.
But earlier brands such as L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also be positioned on a larger area at brand-specific booths such as Boots and similar stores.
The chain is also relaunching the Boutique make-up line, in which most of the products are now vegan, as more and more young customers are looking for them.
Fragrance Shop is also testing its presence at two Sainsbury’s stores, one in Croydon in southern London last week and the other in Selly Oak in Birmingham this year.
With the spread of online shopping and the shift in food shopping habits towards small local stores, department stores need to make greater efforts to lure shoppers in.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe said the offer will be more and more similar to that of a convenience store, as the chain tries to compete with discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl by introducing more and more services and products other than food.
Since the acquisition of the two chains two years ago, Sainsbury’s has opened hundreds of stores with Argos-classes and some Habitat-classes – a move that has had a positive impact on food sales, making the acquisition even more profitable.
The chain’s previous attempt to patch up the beauty and medicine departments failed.
Sainsbury's entered into a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but a dispute over the distribution of the proceeds of the drug divisions in its stores put an end to this.
The new strategy comes three years after Sainsbury's sold its <0xC2><0xA3>125m pharmaceutical business in 281 stores to Celesio, the Lloyds drugstore chain.
According to the chain, Lloyds will be part of the strategy and will offer a wider range of luxury skin care products in four stores, with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury's, said: "By changing the look of our toiletries, we want to create a more pleasant environment for our customers.
In addition, we hired qualified staff to help those interested with advice.
Our brand offering caters to all needs, and the attractive environment and conveniently accessible location provide the seductive power that takes the shopping experience to a new level."
Peter Jones 'butted' after Holly Willoughby withdraws <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones has left “in a rage” after television presenter Holly Willoughby canceled an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for the homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The two celebrities’ businesses were previously compared to the Goop brand by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old This Morning presenter announced on Instagram that he was quitting.
Holly Willoughby pulled the plug on Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones when she stepped out of their promising lifestyle business at the last minute – to focus on her own highly lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to some sources, Jones was “dumb” when, in a tense meeting at Jones’s business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday, Jones’s sweetheart announced that due to his new contracts totalling <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, he did not have enough time to devote to their joint brand of homewear and accessories, Truly.
The two celebrities’ businesses had previously been compared to the Goop brand by Gwyneth Paltrow and were expected to double Willoughby’s estimated fortune of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones traveled from the island to one of his vacation homes.
According to one source, “Truly was by far the most important thing for Holly.
He was going to deal with this in the long run, and it would give him a living for the next few decades.
The fact that he left was a complete surprise to everyone.
Everyone was surprised by what happened on Tuesday, because it was so close to the start.
In the Marlow office, the warehouse is full of goods for sale."
According to experts, the departure of This Morning’s host, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to the sheer amount of money invested in the company’s range from pillows and candles to clothing and home wear, as well as possible delays.
It could also be the end of an old friendship.
Three-child hostess and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp back in 2016, and Jones, 52, took over the presidency in March.
The two couples are vacationing together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s television production office.
Willoughby will be the face of M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV’s I’m A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We don’t want to comment on [Jones’s] business.”
There were harsh words, "then we fell in love"
He joked about what criticism he would receive from the press for his statement, which some may consider to be “unprecedented” and for making such a positive statement about the North Korean leader.
“Why did Trump give up so much?
Trump asked in a funny “newsreader’s” voice.
“I didn’t allow anything.”
Kim would like to meet for a second time after Trump hailed the first meeting in Singapore in June as a giant step toward North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
Talks on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, Ri Jongho, the North Korean representative, told the UN General Assembly on Saturday that, as his country sees it, the United States is not making an “adequate response” to North Korea’s early disarmament steps.
Instead, he said, the United States continues to maintain sanctions aimed at exerting pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his campaign speech.
“Things are going great with North Korea,” he said.
We were supposed to be at war with them.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a very good relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results – the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of American soldiers.
He also explained why he spoke in such an unusual way about his relationship with Kim.
“Being president is not difficult, but there’s not a crowd of tens of thousands out there trying to get in, there’s only about 200 people standing in front of me,” Trump said.
Hundreds of people killed in Indonesian tsunami and earthquake
Indonesia has also refused assistance from international aid agencies in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population had to be evacuated, no national-level disaster was reported, which would be a prerequisite for international aid to arrive.
“In the past, there have been a number of very clear statements that they do not need international assistance, so our situation is a bit difficult,” Sumbung said.
The Save the Children Foundation is already working on a rescue team for Palu, but it is not yet certain that foreigners will be able to participate in the rescue efforts on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said the Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Pau to see if international aid agencies need to be involved.
Despite the continuous earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is extremely unprepared to face the destructive power of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in the province of Aceh, this is not common in other coastal areas.
Although a tsunami signal was in place, the apparent lack of a tsunami siren system in Palu also contributed to the disaster, which claimed lives.
Even in the best of times, transport between the Indonesian islands can be difficult.
In times of natural disasters, logistics is even more problematic.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok is on its way to Palu, but at least three days before it reaches the disaster zone.
President Joko Widodo has put the development of Indonesia’s shabby infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign and has not spared any costs in road and rail projects.
However, the Yoko government is now facing budget deficits ahead of next year’s elections.
The president is also facing ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, as the Muslim majority began to follow a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been displaced as a result of the riots, during which Christian and Muslim gangs clashed in the streets with brush cutters, bows and arrows, and other incendiary weapons.
Video: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores a huge goal against Chelsea
In the Premier League match at Stamford Bridge in London, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the 89th minute.
His team was 0-1 down when Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal.
First he put the ball to the left, then he launched a huge kick into the far corner of the gate.
The shot passed high over the hexagon and flew to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally went into the net over the projected Kepa Arrizabalaga.
“I just wanted to be in the position because there’s always someone like Shaq who plays the ball forward, so I tried to put myself in the position as much as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming, and I just took him off, and then I didn’t think much, and I shot him.”
Chelsea led 1<0xE2><0x88><0x92>0 in the half, after scoring a goal in the 25th minute for the Belgian star player Eden Hazard.
With the blues forward corner Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D> passed the ball, then managed to break off in the midfield and rush into Liverpool's half of the field.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D> made a quick pass and got the ball back on the midfield.
Then, with a beautiful pass, he started Hazard towards the hexagon.
Hazard ran the defense and ended up sending the ball with a left-handed shot to the far corner at Liverpool's goal near Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will meet Napoli in the Stadio San Paolo on Wednesday afternoon at 3 p.m. as the next stop of the Champions League group stage.
Chelsea will play against Videoton on Thursday at 3 p.m. in the UEFA Europa League in London.
832 people have died in the Indonesian tsunami.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the local disaster management agency said on Sunday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday and a 10-foot-tall tsunami in its wake have buried more people in the rubble, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The streets of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, are covered with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder in the case of a stabbed woman.
Police are investigating a murder after the body of a woman was discovered this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The body of the 44-year-old woman, covered in stabbings, was found at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man has already been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking residents of the area to report anyone who has seen anything or is dead.
Superintendent Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is still at an early stage, however, I would like to ask everyone who was in the John Street area of Birkenhead and may have seen or heard something to contact us.
“I would also ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything with an onboard camera, to contact us because they may have information relevant to the investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman was a Birkenhead resident and was found inside a property.
During the afternoon, the woman’s friends arrived at the scene to find out where the body had come from in the early hours of the morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police are currently in the process of notifying the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver from Grayson Mews tried to get into his apartment but was told by police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
When he found out what had happened, the man could not speak.
The occupants of the building have now been informed that it may take several hours before they can enter the building again.
One of the officers told someone that the entire building is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman was struggling with tears.
“That’s terrible,” he repeated.
At 2 p.m., there were two police minibuses inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several police officers inside the cordon were watching the block.
Anyone with any information should write a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers on the anonymous number 0800 555 111 and refer to the September 30, 247 file.
The Cromwell statue in Parliament is the latest victim of the history-rewriting fever
The exile of the statue might be a poetic justice for Cromwell and his fanatical Puritan followers who destroyed England’s cultural and ecclesiastical heritage with the enthusiasm of the Taliban.
According to the Cromwell Society, however, Crick's proposal is "foolishness," an "experiment to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the Oliver Cromwell statue in front of the Palace of Westminster would eventually become a target in the current debate on the removal of the statues.
During the English Civil War, the painting was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
So perhaps another Cromwell could fall victim to the actions of his ancestor Thomas of the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s stunning portrayal of Cromwell reflects the views of the 19th century and commemorates a historical figure whom many still believe should be celebrated today.”
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is perhaps less widely regarded today than at the end of the 19th century, but he is regarded by many as the defender of parliament against external pressure, which in his case was, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this picture is really accurate remains the subject of historical debate.
What is certain, however, is that this conflict, which erupted in the middle of the 17th century, had an impact on the future fate of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable person who represents one side of this conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are worth celebrating and commemorating."
Killer Pig Wounds Chinese Farmer to Death
According to local media, a pig attacked and injured a farmer in a market in southwest China.
A man identified by his last name Yuan was found covered in blood with a torn-up artery near a pigsty in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate the pigs with a vaccine in a herd on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
The man traveled with his cousin from nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the fair.
The next morning, his cousin found the man’s body and discovered that the door to the neighboring pigsty was open.
According to him, the mouth of the huge boar in the pigsty was bloody.
According to the report, the expert’s investigation revealed that the 250-kg pig actually killed the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and torn apart,” a relative named Wu by the Guiyang Evening News said.
According to security cameras, Yuan entered the pigsty at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not the property of Yuan or his cousin.
The head of the market told Evening News that the pig was locked away so that it could not harm others while police were investigating the traces on the spot.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are reportedly currently discussing compensation for the man’s death.
Although it is not common, there have been reports of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on their farm in Massachusetts and caused life-threatening injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig in Wales had squeezed a farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to scare him away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that while pigs are generally not prone to attack, the taste of blood can make them aggressive.
“They are very playful.
Like little kids, they're very interested... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to show them respect,” he said.
Heavy rains following Hurricane Rosa in the Southwest region of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken as it reaches the colder waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
Rosa, however, will continue to cause heavy rains in the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa struck at 140 km/h as a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on Sunday morning, 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure zone is forming over the Pacific Ocean and heading westwards toward the west coast of the United States. As the Rosa approaches Lower California on Monday, it is flooding the southwestern United States with heavy tropical haze as a tropical storm.
The storm could bring up to 25 cm of precipitation to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity meeting with the approaching low-pressure masses will cause heavy rains in the coming days in the southwest.
Here, precipitation of 3–10 cm can cause sudden floods, floods full of debris, landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity can cause precipitation of 5–8 cm per hour, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, 5–10 cm of precipitation is expected, especially in Arizona.
Sudden flooding can also occur, with rapidly decreasing intensity due to the sporadic nature of tropical rains.
Especially during tropical rains, it is not recommended to go on foot in the desert.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into rushing rivers, and thunderstorms are sometimes accompanied by sudden gusts of wind and dust clouds.
The coming low-pressure masses could cause heavy rainfall in some parts of the southern California coast.
Precipitation of up to 1.5 cm is possible, which can cause minor flooding with debris and slippery road conditions.
This will be the first rain of the wet season in the region.
Scattered tropical showers can occur as early as Sunday evening and Monday morning in Arizona, followed by wider areas during the day on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners region on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, there will be intense temperature fluctuations in the United States as Arctic air masses cool, but tropical ones will remain quite warm.
This can cause drastic temperature differences even at short distances.
An excellent example of this is the situation on Sunday in the central region of the United States.
Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) and St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) have a temperature difference of nearly 10 degrees.
Summer heat is expected to be felt again in larger areas in the coming days.
The central and eastern regions of the United States are expected to experience warm weather in the first half of October, with temperatures ranging from about 25 to 30 degrees Celsius from the southern Great Plains to parts of the northwest.
Temperatures in New York will reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 5 degrees higher than average.
According to long-term weather forecasts, temperatures in the eastern United States are likely to exceed average temperatures until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's audition
A total of more than 20 million viewers followed the testimony of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of rape in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television channels.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate has not been resolved, and broadcasters have had to interrupt regular broadcasts due to a last-minute Friday twist: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake managed to get the FBI a week to investigate the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh had caught him at a high school party and tried to undress him.
Kavanaugh said in his passionate testimony that he was 100 percent sure that this had not happened.
The testimony was seen by more than 20.4 million viewers on Friday, according to Nielsen.
Nielsen calculated the average number of viewers for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which broadcast the hearing were not immediately available.
Nielsen also has a hard time measuring the number of people who watch shows at work.
For comparison, that’s how many viewers there are for the football finals or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, of all channels, the Fox News Channel, which hosts experts supporting Kavanaugh’s appointment, had the highest viewership, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day audition.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS received 3.1 million views, NBC 2.94 million views, MSNBC 2.89 million views, and CNN 2.52 million views, according to Nielsen.
The interest did not decrease after the hearing.
The main character in Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the moderate Republican senator’s office issued a statement saying that she would vote for Kavanaugh, she was seen on CNN and CBS on Friday morning as a loud crowd of protesters greeted her as she scrambled in an elevator to a meeting of the Justice Committee.
For minutes he stood gazing at the scene while the crowd scolded him, and CNN broadcast the scene live.
“I’m standing here before you,” a woman told the senator.
“Do you really think Kavanaugh is telling the truth in public?”
Others shouted at her, “You have the power to do what so many women do not.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he added that he would share his findings at a committee hearing.
It was then broadcast live on cable and broadcast channels hours later as the committee voted whether Kavanaugh’s nomination should be submitted to the full Senate for a vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate next week, as the minority Democrats had urged.
Flake was convinced of the need by his conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake was determined by his conversations with the Coons and later other senators.
Flake exercised his power appropriately, as it was obvious that without the investigation, the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh's nomination.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh’s allegations.
Theresa May accuses Brexit opponents of political games
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused opponents of her plans to leave the European Union of threatening the UK’s future and undermining the nation’s interests by playing politics.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview appearing on the front page right next to May’s interview, May’s former foreign minister Boris Johnson attacks May’s so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the suggestion that Britain and the EU handle each other’s tariffs is “absolutely absurd.”
The Wayde Sims Murder: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson for Killing LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting that resulted in the death of 20-year-old basketball player Wayde Sims of Louisiana State University (LSU).
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested on charges of manslaughter, Baton Rouge police said.
Police released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and also announced that during the fight, Sims’ glasses fell off.
Police found the glasses at the scene, with Simpson's DNA on it, on the WAFB channel of the CBS network.
After questioning Simpson, police announced that the young man had admitted to shooting Sims.
According to the Advocate’s report, the court has set bail at $350,000.
A preliminary report released by the East Baton Rouge County Coroner's Office on Friday said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The office thanked the Louisiana State Police’s Fugitive Offenders Unit, the State Police’s Forensic Laboratory, the University Police, and residents of the area for their help in the investigation that led to the suspect’s arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the competent law enforcement forces for their “committed and persistent work in finding the truth.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2-meter-tall attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for LSU.
In the final season, Sims scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said news of Sims' death had "shocked" the team.
“You’re always afraid that something like this might happen,” Wade said.
Volcano infests Mexico City with ash
The ash from the volcano Popocatépetl reached the southern districts of the Mexican capital.
After the volcanic activity intensified in the crater and a total of 183 gas and ash eruptions occurred in 24 hours, the National Center for Disaster Prevention asked the Mexican population to stay away from the volcano.
The center has also observed several rumblings and tremors.
Images on social media sites show that in some districts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, the windshields of cars are covered with a thin layer of ash.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in the activity of a volcano 72 km southeast of the Mexican capital after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook the central region of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on anniversary of independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police and thousands joined the rival demonstrations on the first anniversary of Catalonia’s split plebiscite.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs and paint powder at the riot police who were holding them back, so the streets, which were crowded with tourists at other times, were now covered with thick powder paint.
Later in the day, further fighting broke out, during which the police tried to maintain order with a baton.
For hours, pro-independence groups chanting the slogan “We will not forget, we will not forgive” and pro-union protesters rallying behind the slogan “Long live Spain”.
According to local media reports, 14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
Tensions in the independence-seeking region continue to fall as a result of a referendum held on October 1 by Madrid, which has been hailed by Catalan separatists.
A huge majority of voters voted for secession, although turnout was rather low as most unionists boycotted the vote.
Catalan authorities say nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police attempted to stop voting in polling stations through aggressive clashes.
Pro-independence groups were on the streets all night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
Although it could not be prevented, the demonstration did not follow the normal route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in the separatist demonstrations with his wife, says there is no longer a chance for Catalonia to gain independence.
“Last year was one of the best times of our lives.
“I saw my parents crying tears of joy that we could vote, but now our case has come to a standstill,” he said.
Although last December’s regional elections saw a substantial, albeit limited, victory, Catalan independence parties find it difficult to maintain their momentum this year, as many of their best-known leaders have gone into voluntary exile or are awaiting arrest by the court for their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old auto mechanic who recorded the protest with her phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he says.
Catalan leader Oriol Junqueras, who has been in pre-trial detention since last year, announced on Saturday that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
“The most I can reject is the devaluation of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish government represents, if I stand as a candidate in the European elections,” he said.
Londonderry: Police arrested three men who drove their cars into the same house
Police arrested a 33-year-old man, a 34-year-old man and a 39-year-old man who drove into the same house several times in Londonderry.
The incident occurred around 7:30 p.m. British summer time at Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building itself were damaged.
It is possible that at some point the car was even shot at with a crossbow.
Menga scored a 1–0 win over the Rangers at Livingston
Dolly Menga secures Livingston victory with first goal
Newly promoted to the first division, Livingston surprised the Rangers by adding Steven Gerrard to his second defeat, having been coach of the Ibrox club for 18 games.
Dolly Menga’s goal made the real difference, as Gary Holt’s team tied Hibernian in second place.
The Gerrards remain undefeated in the Scottish league’s current season and will face the first-placed Hearts next Sunday, eight points behind.
However, the Rangers have another game ahead of them on Thursday in the Europa League against Rapid Wien.
Meanwhile, Livingston increased their divisional undefeated streak to six wins, meaning Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has not yet lost to the team.
Livingston misses a lot of chances against the imprecise guest team
Holt's team could have taken the lead long before the game's only goal, as they caused the Rangers quite a bit of trouble with their offensive play.
Scott Robinson broke through the opponent's defense, but pulled the attack too far, and then Alan Lithgow's attempt turned out to be wide, having slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's cross-ended ball in front of the goal line.
The home team allowed the Rangers to play their own game, as they were sure that they would be able to distract guests in fixed play situations.
The decisive goal was born from exactly such a situation.
The Rangers had a free kick, and Livingston found a gap in the defense. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created a situation for Menga, who took advantage of this to score from the middle of the 16.
At this stage of the game, the Rangers led in possession of the ball, but home defenses remained impenetrable, and Liam Kelly's goal was barely compromised.
This trend continued into the second half of the game, except for one situation where Kelly had to defend against Alfredo Morelos's attack.
Scott Pittman's attempt was saved by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow missed another free kick at Livingston.
Two penalties were not awarded to the attacking team: one by Halkett against substitute Glenn Middleton, and the other by hand, and the other by hand.
"Phenomenal" game from Livingston - match analysis
Tony Macaroni Arena reports Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland correspondent
Livingston performed phenomenally and took the credit.
The players all performed well and exceeded all expectations.
The team members and style of play have changed little since they returned to the top, but Holt’s efforts deserve a lot of recognition, as the coach has really boosted the team since he arrived.
There are many players in their best form.
Team Captain Halkett did a great job with his well-organized defense, and Menga gave Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall a good sweat.
The Rangers played without a concept.
No matter how well they performed at times under Gerrard’s leadership, they were now unable to bring themselves to that level.
The last shot was always missing from the formula – they only managed to break the domestic defence once anyway – so the Rangers need to get their act together quickly as they slid back into the middle of the field.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives mixed reception in Cologne
A pleasant atmosphere and cheerfulness characterized the morning meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany on Saturday (September 29) in Berlin.
This was the last day of Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s divisive visit to Germany, which was aimed at improving relations between NATO member countries.
Relations between the two countries deteriorated due to issues related to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s membership of the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then traveled to Cologne for the opening ceremony of a newly built huge mosque.
The city of Cologne is home to the largest community of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police have banned the gathering of 25,000 people outside the mosque for security reasons, but several supporters of the president have appeared to see the Turkish president.
In addition, hundreds of anti-Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an protesters, including a number of Kurds, have expressed their displeasure with Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s policies and the German government’s decision to host the head of state.
The two opposing demonstrations illustrate the divisiveness of the president’s policies, with some German citizens of Turkish origin hailing him as a hero, while others see him as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: crashed into a bicycle car and lost his life
A cyclist was killed when he collided with a car in London.
The crash occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a high-traffic road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at approximately 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics tried to help the cyclist, but he died on the spot.
The crash came just months after another cyclist was killed in Childers Street, just a mile from Saturday’s crash site.
Police in London said they were still working to identify the man so they could notify his family.
Road closures and bus diversions are making traffic more difficult, and authorities advise motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Prison Guards Injured in Riot
Six prison guards were injured in riots that broke out in the prison, the prison administration said.
The riots began at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire and have not yet been contained.
In order to deal with the situation, a special unit called “Tornado” was deployed to the scene. The riots involved eight inmates, who were forced back into a wing of a building.
The members of the special forces suffered only minor head injuries, which were treated on the spot.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “A specially trained prison guard team is handling the situation at Long Lartin Prison.
Six members of the team were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence on any level in our prisons, and those responsible will be handed over to the police and face further prison sentences."
The Long Lartin men’s prison holds more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to be hospitalized after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
And in October last year, special forces were also needed to help put down a major riot, in which prisoners used billiard balls to attack prison staff.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (but the situation in drought-stricken areas may improve)
Arizona is rarely hit by tropical depressions, but that’s what the state is expected to expect early next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa sweep across the desert southwest, dramatically increasing the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, as well as for southeastern California and Utah, including cities in Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass through Phoenix on Tuesday, where it is expected to arrive on Monday night, bringing heavy rains.
The weather service in Phoenix posted the following message on Twitter: “Since 1950, ten tropical cyclones have reached within 200 miles of Phonenix in the form of a tropical storm or depression!
Hurricane Katrina (1967), for example, approached the border of AZ by 40 miles.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict a rainfall of 50-100 mm, which can reach 150 mm in extreme cases, such as in the area of Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
In other parts of the southwestern desert areas (central areas of the Rocky Mountains, Great Basin, etc.) a rainfall of 25–50 mm is expected, but in some places it can fall as much as 100 mm.
The rains brought by Rosa may provide relief for areas not threatened by flash floods, as the area is currently suffering from severe drought.
Despite the fact that floods are a serious threat, some of the rains can have a beneficial effect on drought-prone areas in the southwest.
“According to the U.S. Drought Watch, more than 40 percent of Arizona’s territory is affected by at least extreme drought, the second most dangerous category,” according to weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will first land on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
It will continue to be hurricane-force, and on Sunday morning, with winds of up to 137 km/h, will pass some 600 km south of Mexico’s Punta Eugenia land bridge and will travel north at a speed of about 19 km/h.
The storm will encounter colder currents in the Pacific Ocean, and it will lose its strength.
So it is expected to hit the coast of Mexico again as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or in the evening.
In some areas of Mexico, heavy rainfall is expected, which significantly increases the chances of flooding.
“Rainfalls can result in an average of 70 to 150 mm of precipitation from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora, where 250 mm of precipitation may fall in some places,” the weather.com report said.
Rosa then travels north through Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday, in the form of a tropical depression, to sweep across Arizona and into southern Utah on Tuesday night.
“The greatest danger posed by Rosa and her remains will come from the extreme rainfall expected in lower California, northwest Sonora, and the desert areas of the southwest United States,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
Rainfall is expected to cause life-threatening lightning storms and debris flows in desert areas, and landslides in mountainous areas are to be feared.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
At 4:00 a.m. local time on Saturday, an injured teenage boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace of Midsomer Norton.
The boy was immediately taken to the hospital and was in “stable” condition.
According to police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested in Radstock, Avon and Somerset during the night.
The authorities are asking the public to contact them if anyone has a mobile phone record of what happened.
Trump Says Kavanaugh Must Have Suffered “Battle and Anger” from Democratic Party
“Anyone who votes for Judge Kavanaugh is voting against the Democratic Party’s merciless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered “maliciousness and anger” during his candidacy.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he flatly and passionately denied Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation that he had been sexually assaulted as a teenager decades earlier.
Ford testified at the hearing and supported his earlier claims.
The president said on Saturday that “the Americans saw with their own eyes” Kavanaugh’s “brilliant and fearless character” that day.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the finest legal professionals of our time with a clean record of public service,” Trump told supporters in West Virginia.
The president implied Kavanaugh’s candidacy while talking about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the by-elections.
“It’s only five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I’m not going to go in person, but I’m actually going to go, he said.
“That’s why I go everywhere to support the best candidates.”
Trump has argued that Democrats follow a tactic of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first Senate vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place on Friday, a senior Republican adviser told CNN.
Hundreds Killed in Indonesian Earthquake Tsunami, Deaths Rise
At least 384 people were killed when the massive waves hit the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia, after a powerful earthquake and tsunami, local authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at the festival in Palu on Friday, when the nearly six-meter-high (18-foot) waves reached the shore at dusk, sweeping away many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was triggered by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
“When the tsunami alert was issued yesterday, people simply stayed longer on the beach, didn’t run away immediately, so they became victims of the waves,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Response Agency (BNPB), told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t just come on its own, it took cars, logs, houses and everything else off the coast,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was traveling at 800 km/h on the high seas before reaching the coast.
Some climbed to the top of trees from the flood and escaped, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 shelters Please.
The aerial photographs published by the agency of the disaster show a number of destroyed buildings and commercial premises, several twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Further aftershocks shook the coastal town on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt in an area of about 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said Friday’s earthquake released about 200 times more energy than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The agency added that the city is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, and the resulting geographic conditions could have amplified the impact of the tsunami.
Nugroho said the damage was “significant,” with thousands of homes destroyed, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsing.
The bodies of several victims were found in the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that the number of injured so far is 540, and 29 more are being sought.
Nugroho said the damage and the number of injuries on the Donggala, an area on the coast 300 km (190 miles) from Palu, could be even greater as it was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication is "completely paralyzed, there's no way to get information" about Donggala, Nugroho said.
“More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that the organization’s staff and volunteers were already on their way to the affected area.
“The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse,” he said.
The agency received numerous criticisms on Saturday for failing to inform the public about the tsunami that hit Palu, but management said the waves had already reached the shore when the alert was issued.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man from the upper floor of a building frantically shouting to warn people on the street of the approaching tsunami.
Within a few minutes, a huge wall of water hits the shore, dragging cars and buildings along with it.
Reuters has not yet been able to confirm the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a power outage, making communication around Palu impossible, making it more difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army sent relief supplies in cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but authorities say the evacuated population will continue to be in great need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport was only opened to facilitate relief work, and will be closed for all other purposes until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the PAU evacuation centers on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's really bad.
The World Vision team arrived safely from Donggala to the city of Palu, where employees found shelter under tarpaulins in the courtyard of the office, but along the way they encountered traces of terrible destruction, Doseba said.
“They said they saw a lot of ruined houses,” he added.
It's very bad."
While relief teams began preparing for disaster relief, some complained that foreign professionals with extensive experience in the field were unable to travel to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, all overseas aid, relief supplies and personnel can only be allowed into the country if the site of the disaster is declared a disaster area at the national level.
That hasn't happened yet.
“The incident continues to be treated as a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government admits that this is indeed a national disaster, we can allow international emergency services in, but so far no announcement has been made.
On the second night after Friday’s quake and tsunami, Puna’s friends and family were still hopeful that their loved ones would be among those whose miraculous escape would shed some light on the dark atmosphere of natural disasters.
On Saturday, during the rescue work, a small boy was pulled out of the canal.
On Sunday, the workers managed to rescue a woman trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, prepared two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month, this time in Indonesia.
Other students were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi.
“As a veteran paraglider, what has happened has been a great emotional burden on me,” he said.
Gendon recalled that when news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel began to spread among paragliders, he spent hours desperately trying to reach on WhatsApp the contestants who were attending the beach festival, Puna.
In addition to the messages, however, there was only one grey tick instead of two blue ones.
“I guess that means the messages could no longer be delivered,” he said.
$26,750 Stolen While Filling Up ATM in Newport on the Levee Shopping Mall
Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink’s employee who had just loaded an ATM with cash at Newport on the Levee shopping mall, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the cash van had just emptied an ATM at the entertainment center and was about to load it with additional banknotes, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
A man “approached Brink’s employee from behind” while he was busy with his job and stole one of the money bags he had prepared.
Witnesses saw several suspected perpetrators fleeing the scene, but the police statement did not give the exact number of suspects.
Anyone with information about the identity of the perpetrators can contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper's name changed to Yére
Kanye West, the rapper, is now Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday with the message: "The creature that used to be called Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time, and his eighth album, released in June, was also called Ye.
He announced the name change ahead of his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
Ariana Grande has resigned from the show for "emotional reasons," the show's producer said.
The new name is not just an acronym for the rapper’s current stage name – according to previous revelations, it also has religious significance for West.
“I know ‘Ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said earlier when speaking to Big Boy radio host about the title of his album.
I am you and I am you and we are all one.
Kanye means the only one, and from this only Ye became, which represents the good, the bad, the confusion, everything within us.
The album is a reflection of who we really are.”
Ye is one of those famous rappers who likes to change their name.
Sean Combs has previously been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, and Diddy, but this year he announced that he would prefer Love and Brother Love.
West's former co-creator, Jay-Z, also varied his name several times, including whether his name should be spelled with hyphens or capital letters.
Mexican President vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed never to use force against civilians in the wake of the 50th anniversary of the student protests.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador said on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he would “never use the army to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, military forces opened fire on participants in a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing about 300 people, when left-wing student movements showed signs of strengthening in Latin America.
Mr L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans – he will provide monthly financial support to students and plans to establish additional free public universities.
He argued that unemployment and lack of education are the two main factors driving young people into the arms of criminal organizations.
The U.S. Should Double the Funding Framework for AI Solutions
As China becomes more active in AI research and development, the U.S. should double its support for AI research, said Kai-Fu Lee, an AI solutions investor and developer who previously worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He said this after the U.S. government made announcements about artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China has also announced plans to become the world’s number one AI developer by 2030.
“Doubled the AI research budget would be a good start, as all other countries are significantly behind the U.S. and the next AI breakthrough is imminent,” Lee said.
Doubling research funding could double the chances of the United States taking the next big step in the field of artificial intelligence, he said in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of China’s leading AI companies, Face+.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated the best American Othello player, and later served as a board member of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged the results of technology competitions previously announced by the US government, including the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next such event would be held, because it would be possible to find new future-shapers.
U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get the government funding they need for their research, Lee said.
“It is not China that is taking away the scientific leaders, it is the big companies,” he added.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have contracted several major university skulls over the past few years to work in the field of AI.
According to Lee, a change in immigration policy could also greatly help the US’s efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think people who have a PhD in artificial intelligence should automatically get a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China announced plans to develop the next generation of artificial intelligence.
China’s National Science Foundation provides funding to academic staff in a similar way as the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee explained.
This year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which brings together industry professionals and academics, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA invested $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF is currently spending $100 million a year on AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which planned to set up a national security AI committee, has not taken any further action on the matter for months.
Macedonia to hold referendum on changing the country’s name
The people of Macedonia voted in Sunday’s referendum on whether to change the country’s name to the “Republic of North Macedonia”, a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that prevented the country’s application for membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece, one of whose provinces is called Macedonia, argued that the name of its northern neighbour indicates that it wants a Greek territory with the same name, and has thus far vetoed the country’s membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments struck a deal in June to change the name of the state, but nationalist opponents say the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s mostly Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not take part in the referendum and, as a result of the boycott campaign launched, it became doubtful whether the 50% turnout required for a valid referendum would be achieved.
The question on the ballot reads as follows: “Do you support the country’s NATO and EU membership and accept the agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price worth paying in order to give Macedonia, one of the countries that has risen on the ruins of Yugoslavia, a chance to become a member of the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of the country, so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it would mean a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgiyevska (79).
Although the referendum itself is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have declared that they feel bound by the outcome of the vote.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
According to the state election committee, no irregularities were reported until 1:00 p.m. on the day of the election.
However, the turnout reached only 16% up to this point, which was 34% in the 2016 parliamentary elections (which ended up with 66% of registered voters).
“I voted for the sake of my children because we belong in Europe,” said Gyose Tanevski, 62, who cast his vote in Skopje.
Zoran Zaev, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica, and their son Dushko, voted to change their name in a referendum in Strumica on September 30, 2018, which would allow the country to join the EU and NATO.
In Skopje, in front of the parliament building, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) set up a small stage, as well as chairs and tents for those boycotting the referendum.
“We also support the country’s membership in NATO and the EU, but we would like to join with pride and a raised head, and not through the servant’s door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have not lost our dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, then we can turn to China or Russia as part of the Eurasian integration.”
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership could provide Macedonia with investments that are much needed in a country with more than 20% unemployment.
“I think the majority will support our cause, because more than 80% of the population of the country is basically in favour of EU and NATO membership,” Zaev said after he cast his vote.
He added that a “yes” vote would “guarantee the country’s future.”
According to the results of a survey published by Macedonia’s political science research institute last Monday, 30-43% of voters are expected to take part in the referendum, which is lower than the required turnout.
According to another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV, a participation rate of 57% is expected on Sunday.
Of those who voted, 70% said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be valid, the turnout must be at least one vote more than 50%.
The nullity of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government that came to power in May last year.
Video: Manchester City defender Sergio Aguero scores a goal to avoid the full Brighton defence
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling dealt with Brighton's defence and Manchester City won 2–0 at Etihad Stadium in England on Saturday.
Aguero scored his 65th minute goal as if it were the easiest thing in the world.
The Argentine striker received a pass in midfield as the first step of the attack, and
He got out into the open by getting away from the three Brighton defenders.
Then four green jerseys surrounded Aguero.
He outsmarted a defender and ran several runs, coming close to the Brighton Sixteen.
Then he passed to the left to Sterling who appeared there.
The English striker returned the ball to Aguero by force, who finished the action with his right foot, hitting the Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan on the right side of the gate.
“Aguero has leg problems,” Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We agreed that he could play 55, 60 minutes at the most.
And that's what happened.
Fortunately, he scored a goal.”
The Blues were able to gain an initial advantage by Sterling's action during the English Championship match.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero, who was in the middle of Brighton, had a great pass.
He launched a beautiful cross ball towards Leroy Sane on the left side.
Sane played with the ball for a while before starting Sterling on the long run.
In the battle of the blues, he could barely flick the ball into the goal before sliding outside the baseline.
City will play the Hoffenheim team in the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make things harder for the Rockies
As the Nationals missed the opportunity to get into the low season, there was no reason for them to make any real effort.
Scherzer is always looking forward to playing the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the opposing team still has a chance in the playoffs. The Rockies have a one-game advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West baseball league.
The Rockies secured at least one consolation seat by winning 5–2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but their first division title is yet to be won.
“Irrespective of the fact that we don’t have a chance anymore, we can stand up to them with the fact that the atmosphere of the audience and the other team in Denver is likely to be at its peak for the whole year.
Of course I want to be on the field like that!”
The Nationals have yet to pick a starting player for Sunday, but it is reported that Scherzer will be the pitcher in this situation.
For Scherzer, who participated in pitching practice on Thursday, this will be his 34th starting pitch on Sunday, which is usually his day of rest.
The right-handed Washington player is 18-7, 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts this season after 220 and 2/3 innings.
Trump's campaign in West Virginia
The president also hinted at the situation surrounding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the by-elections.
“In November, everything we’ve done so far is at stake.
We are only five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
It’s one of the big ones – I’m not running in person, but I’m actually running, so I’m going everywhere to support the best candidates.”
Trump said: “Everyone can see what these terrible radical democratic groups are doing, they can see it with their own eyes.
They are truly determined and can use whatever means necessary to regain power, malice and meanness can be seen.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they trample so they can have control, they have power. They want that, control and power, but we don't give in."
The president says Democrats are using “resistance and obstruction.”
“They’ve seen it all in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and malicious and mean and lying.”
By name, he mentioned Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, in whose hearing he voiced the outcry of the assembled crowd.
“Do you remember what he said?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, what's that?
No, uh, no, wait -- all this with really bad body language, that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer supports diversity.
It does not tolerate those who freely say what they think
I was not at all surprised when the activists of Momentum decided to censor me in my own party.
After all, I am only the last of a long line of Labour MEPs who have been told that they are not welcome simply because we have said what we think.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, has been treated in a similar way for her steadfast stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship did not like the fact that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, of national security and of Europe, are, ironically, precisely the issues on which Jeremy also disagreed with the previous leaders.
The invitation to the Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East on Friday said they wanted an “inclusive and productive meeting”.
For most of my eight years as a local Labour Party representative, these Friday evening meetings were exactly that.
Today, however, the tone has changed, and the promise of a “more restrained, more polite” policy has been forgotten, if ever realised.
It is increasingly striking that the Labour Party does not tolerate dissent, and all opinions are judged on the basis of whether they are acceptable to the party leadership.
This trend started not long after Jeremy became the leader of the couple, and my colleagues, with whom I thought we had a similar political attitude, have recently been increasingly expecting me to turn my back on my individual opinions and to take sides on things that I would otherwise never agree with, be it national security issues or the single European market.
After all my public speeches, no matter what I actually said, they start blaspheming on social media, demanding my replacement, criticizing the politics in the middle, and telling me that I shouldn’t even be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just me.
In fact, I know that I am luckier than many of my colleagues, as comments addressed to me are usually confined to politics.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues in politics who are forced to stand up to sexist and racist attacks on a daily basis but do not run away.
The most disappointing aspect of today’s politics is that attacks of this level have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality, however, is that we have renounced diversity, and with every “doubt” motion and every amendment to the electoral rules, the circle of those who are tolerated in the party is narrowing.
Over the years, many people have advised me to hold back, not to be so outspoken, and then “everything will be fine.”
But that is not why I went into politics.
Thirty-two years ago, as a student, I joined the Labour Party because I was outraged that the Thatcher government had so neglected schools that our classrooms were crumbling, and then I fought for better public services for the most needy, both as a local councillor and as a government minister.
I have never concealed my political views, nor have I done otherwise in the last election.
In Nottingham East, it was clear to everyone what political positions I represented and where I disagreed with the current leadership.
To those who supported the motion on Friday, I would like to say that in this situation, when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm not only families, but also companies and public services, I do not understand why it is necessary to spend so much time and energy to question my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
My most important message, however, is not to the members of Nottingham Momentum but to my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that any threat of substitution or political intimidation will not deter me from acting in my own judgment and in the interests of all.

Ayr-Melrose 38-17: Ayr reaches the top undefeated
Two late attempts somewhat modified the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win the most entertaining game of the day, the Tennent’s Premiership.
The team is currently at the top of the table, the only undefeated of the ten teams.
Thanks to their unmatched defense and superior use of the situation, they won, so the home team and coach Peter Murchie have every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve had a lot of challenges in our games, but we’re still undefeated, so I have every reason to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie, a Melrose player, said: “We have to admit that Ayr have used their situation much better than we have.”
With Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt to score Frazier Climo, Ayr was in the lead. Melrose would have been able to make the difference thanks to the Warriors' yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, but Jason Baggot's attempt to score no points.
Climo sweated Ayr's defense with a penalty at halftime and scored a point in a one-man trial, resulting in a 17–5 win for Ayr in the first half.
Melrose made a strong start to the second half, with Patrick Anderson trying to sell Baggo, reducing the team's deficit to five points.
Ruaridh Knott was badly injured and had to be taken off the pitch, and Ayr continued to increase his advantage with Stafford McDowall's attempt to win the game with Climo.
Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, also received a yellow card, and Melrose was able to prevent Bruce Colvine's attempt to outmaneuver the pressure on them.
The home team began to catch up again, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for unballing Climo, MacPherson showed a touch down from the penalty line behind Ayr's attacking team.
Climo sold, which he repeated almost immediately after the restart, when Kyle Rowe took off David Armstrong's high kick and sent Gregor Henry off to the home team's fifth attempt.
The main character of the Still Game began a new career in the hospitality industry
Ford Kieran, one of the stars of Still Game, seems to be moving into the hospitality industry: it has been revealed that he has taken over the management of a company that manages restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series he co-writes and co-stars with his old comic partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the next season will be their ninth season, and Kiernan seems to be already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not comment on the news, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan was trying to profit from Glasgow's "blooming hospitality industry".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no coastline, hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific Ocean again
Sailors patrol the sailor's naval command post in La Paz.
Oceanic flags are flying on public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases proclaim the motto: “We have a right to the sea.
It's our duty to recover."
Bolivia, a landlocked country, is still alive with memories of the lost coast, which Chile lost in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century, and there is a strong desire to re-wind the waves of the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the strongest for decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the verdict of the International Court of Justice, which will conclude five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the ball, which infuses people with a spirit of togetherness and peace, who are waiting in a positive mood for the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians have been watching the International Court of Justice’s ruling on video screens, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will stand up for Bolivia, and Chile will be forced to sit down at the negotiating table after decades of rhapsodic attitudes so that Bolivia can have independent access to the sea.
Bolivia’s charismatic, indigenous president Evo Morales, who faces a controversial battle for next year’s re-election, could lose a lot with Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
Some analysts, however, believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favour of Bolivia, and that it would not change the situation much if its decision were favourable to Bolivia.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no authority to judge Chilean territory and has stipulated in advance that it will not influence the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice came just six months after the closing arguments indicates that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, an expert in international law in Chile.
In addition, the past four years have not only not helped the case of Bolivia, but even pushed it back.
“The issue of sea access has been diverted by the current Bolivian government for its own purposes,” Zárate said.
“Because of Morales’ hostile rhetoric, the remaining goodwill of the Chileans is gone.”
Bolivia and Chile will certainly continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to initiate a dialogue after what has happened.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, disagrees with the finding that judicial decision-making was unusually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia an “exceptional opportunity to open a new chapter in its relations with Chile” and a chance for “both to come out of 139 years of contention,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the maritime debate to turn it into a political advantage.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The judgment gives us the opportunity to see that it is time to move beyond the past.”
North Korea: No nuclear disarmament until they can trust America
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho said his country would not be the first to dismantle its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke before the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore summit of the leaders of the two rival countries.
He made the comment at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed to have been able to restart the stalled nuclear talks, more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said he “desires” to believe that continued sanctions and U.S. obstruction of the Korean War’s end-of-war declaration will ever be enough to bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement unless Pyongyang takes significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump want a new summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism surrounding Pyongyang’s commitment to dismantling the arsenal, which the country is likely to view as the only key to its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion shows are showing off the huge headwear that will soon appear in high-end stores
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely cover the day, you don’t have to search any further.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of unusually oversized headgear as part of their spring/summer 2019 collection, which was received with great enthusiasm by the stylish audience of Paris Fashion Week.
Unpractical hats caused a sensation on Instagram in the summer, and the above fashion designers also put their attention-grabbing works on the catwalk.
Valentino’s most spectacular piece was an exaggerated beige hat with a feather-like, wide brim that almost swallowed the heads of the models.
Among the other oversized accessories were watermelons decorated with precious stones, a base for magicians, and even a pineapple, which were not really designed to keep a person’s head warm.
Thom Browne also came up with a selection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had their mouths sewn together and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One of these pieces resembled a diving mask, complete with a pipe and glasses, and the other looked like a melting cone of ice cream.
If you’re into these spectacular pieces, you’re in luck.
According to style analysts, it may be that the huge hats are already on their way to the top-end clothing stores.
The oversized hats follow the path trodden by “La Bomba,” a 60-centimeter-wide brim of straw hats that we’ve seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the little practical hat that captivated the social networks presented another piece on the runway: a beach bag made of straw, which is almost as big as the bathing suit model holding it.
The dark orange raffia bag – decorated with raffia tassels and a white leather handle on top – was one of the highlights of the Spring/Summer 2019 La Riviera collection by Jacquemus at Paris Fashion Week.
Star stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see huge hats and beach bags in the top-end clothing stores next summer. The designer has had such an elemental impact on everyone that it would be hard to deny the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language is essential for global citizens
Scottish independent schools have a tradition of providing excellent education. Looking at the recent outstanding exam results, this situation has not changed in 2018, which is further strengthened by individual and group successes in sports, arts, music and other community initiatives.
In Scotland, more than 30,000 students are already studying in such institutions, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), which aim to provide students and parents with the best possible service.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further education, higher education, their chosen careers, and their positions as citizens of the world.
In an education sector where it is possible to design and implement customized school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to prove popular and sought-after subjects.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to someone in a language they understand, it goes to their head.
But if you speak in his language, it goes to his heart.”
This is an important reminder, because we cannot rely on English alone to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s exam results show that students from independent schools all over the country brought the best results from foreign languages.
Sixty-eight per cent of all students studying a foreign language achieved a higher A grade (above 85 per cent).
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students received a higher A grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students achieved an A grade.
These results confirm that independent schools in Scotland see foreign languages as essential knowledge, which children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages have become as important as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics in both independent and non-independent schools.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Vocational Training found that 17% of employers say filling vacancies is difficult because of a lack of language skills.
From this we can see that language skills are becoming more and more necessary for young people to have successful careers.
As more and more workplaces demand knowledge of foreign languages, language skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of what career you choose, if you have learned a foreign language, you will acquire a lifelong knowledge that will give you a clear advantage.
Being able to communicate directly with other nationalities automatically gives the multi-lingual candidate a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of respondents did not speak a single foreign language well enough to engage with others, and French was the only language spoken by more than 10 percent (15 percent) of respondents.
Therefore, it is important to place emphasis on the language education of children even now.
Speaking several languages, especially in developing countries, can be a tool for children to be equipped with to better compete for important jobs as adults.
Each school in Scotland will have a different language.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while others will teach languages such as Mandarin or Japanese that are expected to be of paramount importance to the UK by 2020.
Whatever your child’s area of interest, you’ll be able to study multiple elective languages at independent schools and be trained by tutors who are experts in their field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that equips and equips children with the skills they will need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
It’s not hard to see that in today’s global business environment, languages remain vital to a country’s future, and education should reflect that.
As a matter of fact, knowledge of modern languages should rather be treated as ‘international communication skills’.
Independent schools offer young people in Scotland the choice, diversity and quality of education.
Il faut bien le faire – this is how it should be.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron to play Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
Fans will not have to wait long to see LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the opening game of the preseason Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes you will spend on the track is still a question.
“More than one and less than 48,” Walton wrote on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After training a few days ago, James was asked what his plans were for the Lakers in the six-game preseason.
“At this point in my career, I don’t have to play in the pre-season to be ready,” he said.
Trump's campaign and YouTube channel in West Virginia
Donald Trump will begin a long series of campaign events tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This will be Trump’s first of five events announced next week, including stops in Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote to confirm the nominee for the vacancy in the Supreme Court has been postponed, Trump is trying to rally support for the upcoming midterm elections, as there is a risk that Republicans will lose control of Congress when the vote comes in November.
When does Trump’s West Virginia event start tonight, and where can you watch it online?
Trump’s speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, will begin tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time.
Trump’s West Virginia rally can be followed online via YouTube.
Trump is also likely to be implicated in this week’s hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which has been particularly tense in light of allegations of sexual harassment, and the Senate’s affirmative vote has been suspended for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the primary purpose of the events is to help Republicans before the November election.
Trump’s campaign adviser said the five events next week “will serve to activate voters and supporters as Republicans try to defend and increase the majority they currently hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Having the control of Congress in his hands is such a critical point of his political plans that the president is visiting as many states as possible, and it’s going to be a busy campaign period,” a campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The event, scheduled to take place at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, is expected to “bring in supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and may even be featured in Pittsburgh media coverage,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the last month, a state where he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who polls show is not in a favorable position.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president needs to intervene personally to get better at the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team fighting shoulder-to-shoulder ahead of Sunday's singles to keep hope alive
After three one-sided attempts, the Saturday afternoon four games were much needed for the Ryder Cup.
The swinging pendulum of luck and momentum is a rather airy sports concept, yet every player believes in it, especially in tournaments like the Ryder Cup.
So who's got the ball now?
“They had a six-point lead and only four lead, so we can say we have the ball,” Jordan Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe still leads by four points, and another twelve can be won.
The Americans, as Spieth tells us, feel that they have finally got a little bit of backbone and can draw encouragement from many things, including Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both scored three points out of four.
Spieth proved to be infallible from kick to hole and exemplary in his performance.
Bay's cries of victory became louder as he moved forward with the lap, scoring a critical roll and leveling off in Game 4, so that he and Thomas were at a double disadvantage after two.
The final roll of the game at the 15th hole resulted in a similar cry of joy, a kind that allows the viewer to believe that all is not lost for the American team.
“You just have to dig deep inside yourself and worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s what awaits the players.
18 holes for the chance to leave a mark.
In the past two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the most popular team in the Ryder Cup, have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas.
Europe’s strange but adorable pair brought four out of four, and they seem to be able to make no mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only pair who did not over the par on Saturday afternoon, and performed similarly on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine stages of Friday morning.
Thanks to this series, and the dynamics between them and the crowd that clamoured for them, they became the benchmark for Sunday, and no one is more expected to secure the victory of Europe at sunset at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
The best would be a win at different holes at the same time.
However, it is too early to celebrate the victory of the Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly executed Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, the hero of the morning quartet, when he played with Alex Noren.
Once and twice in two strokes over the par, the first nine holes were filled by the Spaniards and the Swedes, which plunged them into a trough from which they had no chance to climb out.
On Sunday, there will be no one to help you out of your hole.
Four-ball games and four-ball matches are extremely fun to watch up close thanks to the couple’s interactions. You can observe who gives what advice, what they don’t give, and how strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and will start the last day with a significant advantage, but this fourth section showed that the American team has the necessary courage to fight, despite the fact that many of them were missing, especially from the American side.
Europe starts last day of Ryder Cup with 10-6 advantage
Europe has a good start to the final day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing Saturday’s four-ball and four-ball matches with a 10-6 result against the United States.
The dynamic Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the race with two wins against the infirmary Tiger Woods, bringing the gap to four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn’s European team, which is trying to recover the trophy lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the US team in the morning’s four-ball matches, winning the series 3–1.
America showed more resistance during the fours, bringing in two games, but they still couldn’t make up the difference.
Jim Furyk's team would have to score eight points from Sunday's 12 individual games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their four opening games.
After defeating Woods-Patrick Reed in four-ball, they defeated Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau in a decisive 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes showed his talent, but lost 19 of his 29 games to four-ballers and four-ballers, including seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was resting during the morning four-balls, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson, and in the four-balls was defeated 2&1 by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the first and third place in the world rankings.
Europe, however, did not succeed in everything on this pleasant, windy day, south-west of Paris.
Three-time defending champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the Americans how to do it with two points on Saturday.
They won an excruciating 2&1 victory against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the fours after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a four-point gap in individual races, although Furyk's defending team had a tie to keep the trophy.
However, after two days of only being second best, a Sunday counterattack seems quite unrealistic.
There is no way North Korea will unilaterally demobilize if it does not trust its negotiating partner.
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that maintaining sanctions has only increased mistrust of the United States and that there is no way the country would unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Jongho told the UN General Assembly last year that North Korea had taken “significant and generous steps,” including halting nuclear and missile testing, closing nuclear testing sites, and promising not to expand its nuclear arsenal and scope of nuclear technology.
“Unfortunately, we do not see similar responses from the Americans,” he said.
“In the absence of trust in America, we feel that the security of our nation is not assured, and under these circumstances there is no way that we will be the first to disarm unilaterally.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s disappointment at Washington’s resistance to the idea of “progressive” nuclear disarmament, which would see North Korea rewarded for the steps taken so far, his statement seemed significant because he did not unequivocally reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done so far.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between a US president in power and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim promised to work on “the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” while Trump guaranteed the integrity of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused to comply with tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“America insists that we start with nuclear disarmament, increases the pressure with sanctions to impose its will on us, and also protests against the declaration of an end to the war,” he said.
“The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a pipe dream of people who don’t know us.
“The problem is that non-relieving sanctions only increase our suspicions.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US president specifically mentioned at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister said that three meetings had taken place between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: “If the country involved in nuclear disarmament were South Korea, and not the United States of America, then the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a stalemate.”
Nevertheless, Ri’s tone was dramatically different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the North American continent with North Korean missiles was inevitable, after Trump, “the evil president,” called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened North Korea with “total destruction,” praised Kim for having the courage to take steps toward disarmament, but also noted that there is still a lot of work to be done and sanctions will remain until North Korea implements nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no time limit, that “if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia have argued that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions so far.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “Sanctions by the Security Council must be adhered to steadfastly until we achieve actual, final, verifiable nuclear disarmament.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously maintained sanctions against North Korea in order to cut funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with R<0xC3><0xAD> during the UN General Assembly recess and then said he would travel to Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip hasn’t gone very well.
After leaving Pyongyang in July, he announced that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him of making “gangster-like demands” hours later.
During a meeting with Mun this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile base and a nuclear facility if the United States takes “appropriate steps.”
Mun said the “appropriate steps” that Kim was talking about would be security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore, and steps that could lead to normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Are Educated to Get Enough Rest
A new class at Harvard University this year has encouraged students to get more sleep, fighting against the growing macho culture of caffeine-fuelled, all-night learning.
One academic concluded that students at the world’s number one university are often completely lost when it comes to how they should care for themselves.
The course, which he said was the first of its kind in the United States, was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler, who teaches sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and practices as a specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
What inspired the course to be developed was that he had previously given a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end, a girl came up to me and asked, ‘Why am I just now facing this as a senior?’
He said no one ever talked to him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
Launched for the first time this year, the course will show students how good sleep habits have a fundamental impact on their academic and athletic performance, as well as a positive impact on their overall well-being.
According to Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the university’s health service, the university decided to start the course because the students were found to be extremely sleep-deprived during the week.
The one-hour course also includes a series of interactive exercises.
In one, for example, they show a picture of a dorm room where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and why the bedtime routine is important.
In another section, participants are described how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
They will present a map of the campus area with interactive icons to encourage participants to think about their daily routines.
“We don’t want to change the behavior of our students.
But we believe they have a right to this knowledge – just as they have a right to know the health effects of smoking,” said Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of learning through the night is still flourishing, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Sufficient and quality sleep is a student’s “secret weapon” in the fight against stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, and even protects against obesity, as sleep deprivation forces the brain into starvation mode and causes a constant sense of hunger.
Raymond So helped design the course for Professor Czeisler, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and biophysics, who was the first to take one of the professor’s courses at Harvard last year.
He said what he heard there opened his eyes and encouraged him to pursue a university-level education.
He hopes that, as a next step, postgraduate students will also be able to participate in a similar training programme before finding employment in the private sector.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set a bedtime alert, an alarm for waking up, and learn about the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electric screens and LED light sources, which can easily throw them off their daily rhythm and make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston - Rangers 1-0: Menga defeats Gerrard's men and scores a goal
The Rangers suffered another alien defeat when Dolly Menga's bomb pushed Steven Gerrard's team to a 1–0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team struggled to secure their first away win after a 4-1 win at St. Johnstone in February, but Gerrard lost his second defeat to Gary Holt in 18 of his manager's games, leaving them eight points short of Ladbrokes Premiership's sloping Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers' unmotivated team was not even close to evening out.
While the Rangers slipped to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third, lags behind the Hibernian simply because of the goal difference.
In addition, the Rangers may face further difficulties after the beach sign Calum Spence suffered a head injury that forced him to seek medical attention after an object was likely thrown from the guests’ grandstands.
Gerrard also changed eight points on the team that made it to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup by sweeping Ayr.
Holt played with the same 11 people from Livingston who scored a point for the Hearts last week, and he would have been happy to watch his perfect team smother his opponent’s game wherever he could.
Although the Rangers led in ball possession, Livingston did better with what they had.
They could have scored in the first two minutes when Menga made his first pass to Allan McGregor, but the midfielder failed to sell the pitch.
Keaghan Jacobs' low free kick landed on captain Craig Halkett, but his defenseman Alan Lithgow only hit the side of the gate.
The Rangers took control, but there was more hope in their game in the final third than confidence.
Alfredo Morelos clearly felt he deserved a penalty in the 15th minute when he collided with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson dismissed his Colombian complaints.
The Rangers had only two first-half shots, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little problem with Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livi’s attempt in the 34th minute went against the game, no one can deny that they deserved the chance, even for their hard work.
The Rangers once again missed a Jacobs-forced game.
Scott Arfield didn't react in time when Declan Gallagher pushed the ball in for Scott Robinson, who was great at finding Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard made the decision in the break, replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and this almost immediately had an effect on the game when he teased the farthest Morelos, but the stunning figure Kelly blocked in time.
Livingston continued to play the exact game that suited him, and Lithgow and Halkett swept the long balls one after the other.
Holt's team could have made a bigger head start in the final minutes, but McGregor took the net and knocked out Jacobs before Lithgow missed a corner.
Glenn Middleton, a substitute for the Rangers, tried to fight off another penalty when he ran into Jacobs, but Thomson was still not convinced.
Almanach: the inventor of the Geiger counter
An excerpt from our "Sunday morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, exactly 136 years ago today... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that could lead to a device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has been one of the basic tools of science ever since, and thanks to the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado” featuring strange cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, it has also become part of popular culture:
Man: “What is this miracle?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter. You can use it to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put on these headphones, you can hear the sound of atoms emitted due to the radioactivity of the minerals.”
Evans: "Listen to me, you're bouncing around!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
However, his invention, which bears his name, lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to 'See' Abnormal Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to “See” and Destroy Abnormal Cells
The vaccine, given as part of a treatment, teaches the immune system to recognise abnormal cells.
Part of the method is to extract the immune cells from the patient and then modify them in a laboratory.
Thus, they can “see” the protein that accompanies many types of cancer. The treated immune cells are injected back into the patient.
An experimental vaccine has shown promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize abnormal cells said goodbye to ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
Part of the method is to extract immune cells from the patient; modify them in the laboratory to “see” a protein called HER2, which is often associated with several types of cancer; and then transplant the cells back into the body.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine in our possession.”
HER2 "stimulates the growth of multiple types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and rectal cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method, which is based on highlighting immune cells and “teaching” them how to attack cancer cells, has previously been used successfully in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West’s SNL performance, wearing a MAGA hat, culminated in a blasphemous tirade in support of Trump.
It didn't work out too well.
Kanye West was whistled at Saturday Night Live’s studio after an incoherent statement praising US President Donald Trump and saying he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song, Ghost Town, on Make America’s Great Again cap that night, he began speaking out against the Democrats and re-emphasizing his support for Trump.
“A lot of times when I talk to someone who’s white, they ask, ‘How can you like Trump because he’s racist?’
“If I was interested in racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL was opened by Matt Damon with a parody of the Hollywood star’s mockery of Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blasey Ford’s sexual assault allegations.
Although not aired, the video of West's speech was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the upload.
West even complained to the audience that he was being teased behind the scenes for his hat.
“I was intimidated behind the scenes.
They said, ‘Don’t go out in that hat.’
I'm intimidated!
And they said I was in the sunken place,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see a sunken place? I put on my Superman cape because that means they can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
“Try with love.”
There were at least two whistles from the audience, and SNL’s characters were visibly embarrassed by what one witness told Variety: “The whole studio was shrouded in silence.”
West was invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West posed several questions when he performed the song "I Love It" dressed as Perrier's glass.
The leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, assured West of his support in a tweet: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR BEING IN EYES WITH THE MASS."
Karen Hunter, host of a talk show, tweeted that West was simply “by himself, and that’s great.”
“But I have decided NOT to reward someone (by purchasing his music or his fashions or by sponsoring his ‘art’) who I believe has an ideology that is harmful to the community to which I belong.
He's free.
But so are we,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to “the creature formerly known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name to follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P. Diddy.
His rapper partner Snoop Dogg also took the name Snoop Lion, and of course the late legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Belfast restaurant knife suspect charged with attempted murder
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
According to the police statement, the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear before the Belfast City Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecution.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington finds excessive masculinity harmful
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, and he often wields a sword in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series.
The 31-year-old actor, however, spoke out against stereotypical macho heroes, emphasizing that seeing such heroes can often make little boys feel the need for tough action to earn respect.
In a statement to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thought "something went wrong" and raised the question of how to deal with the harmful effects of excessive masculinity in the #MeToo era.
The star, who recently married her 31-year-old co-star Rose Leslie, said she felt it was important to address the issue.
“I’m personally deeply concerned about this issue – how did the portrayal of masculinity get so distorted?” the actor asked.
“What did we teach men when they were kids about the problem we’re facing now?”
According to Kit, television is also responsible for the spreading of the distorted image of masculinity, as the shows often feature very masculine characters.
He added: “What is it that we are born with, and what are we learning?
What message does the street and TV send to young boys that makes them feel that this is the only way they can be men?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time – and how we can change that.
“There’s something wrong with young people.”
Kit stated in an interview that he would not appear in any Game of Thrones history series or sequels after the series' summer season finale because "he's fed up with battlefields and horses."
Starting in November, she will star in a remake of True West, a film about a producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor said that the best thing he got from Game of Thrones was his wife Rose, whom he met while making the series.
“I met my wife on set, so I owe my future family and my life ahead of me to this show,” Kit said.
She played Rose Ygritte, who was the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: New patients in China up 14%
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say this amounts to more than 820,000 affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, the number of reported cases increased by about 40,000.
The fact that the vast majority of newly infected people acquire the disease sexually is a change compared to the previous ones.
Previously, the disease spread rapidly through transfusions of infected blood in parts of China.
However, health officials at a conference in Yunnan province said the number of such cases had since fallen to almost zero.
Despite this, compared to the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against the community has been very strong ever since.
According to estimates in various studies, 70-90% of men who have sex with other men end up marrying a woman because of the country’s conservative values.
The disease in these relationships spreads in many cases due to inadequate sexual protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has been providing universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of a program to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies one of her crew members leaked information from Republican senators and condemns “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed allegations that a member of her staff posted personal information about three Republican senators on the senators' Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democratic congresswoman said the allegations were spread by “extreme-right” experts and websites.
“Lies, lies and more lies,” Waters wrote on Twitter.
The information reportedly contained the addresses and telephone numbers of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and Utah Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
The information was posted on the Internet on Thursday. The identity of the publisher is unknown, but it is certain that they were published from the Capitol Hill during the hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate on sexual harassment.
The leak came shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, including Gateway Pundit and RedState, said the source's IP address was linked to Waters's office, and they also released information about a Waters crew member, according to The Hill.
“These allegations are completely baseless, false, and obviously untrue,” Waters said.
– My crew member is not responsible for any information leaks. However, his right to anonymity, protection of his personal data and security has been violated due to fraudulent and false accusations.
These allegations are completely baseless, false, and obviously untrue.”
Waters' statements were quickly criticized on the Internet, including by Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary.
“It’s an angry denial,” Fleischer wrote.
It appears that Mr. Waters does not possess the temperament necessary to be a member of parliament.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they should not react angrily.
You can't be defiant.
You can't question the prosecution's motives.
You have to stay calm and calm.”
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to Kavanaugh's reaction to Democratic criticism, which some critics said seemed too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, who is running as a Republican for Waters in the midterm elections, also shared his views on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s serious,” he wrote in his message.
Waters said in a statement that his office had notified “the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies” of the false allegations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified and that they are held legally responsible for any act that endangers or damages any member of my staff.”
Johnny English strikes again, or Rowan Atkinson’s lame spy comedy
It has become a tradition to look for references to Brexit in all British-related films, and there can be no exception to this in the action comedy/parody franchise under the name Johnny English, the first part of which, Johnny English, was released in 2003, and the second, Johnny English, was reloaded in 2011.
Will the British nation’s new export product be the sarcastic, self-parodying satires of our own obvious lameness?
What is certain is that the eye-catching, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English had enough ammunition to make another comeback – it’s clear from the name that this comic character was created to be laughed at by the masses of viewers in cinemas in non-English-speaking countries of the world.
Johnny English is, of course, a nutty secret agent who thinks he’s charming with his bizarre mannerisms, so he reminds me a little of Inspector Clouseau, sometimes Mr. Bean, and occasionally the guy who used a single key to play the Chariots of Fire theme song at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
The character is also based on the mysterious international traveler who was once played by Atkinson in a long-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, leaving chaos everywhere.
There are a few good moments in the last Johnny English movie.
I loved how Johnny English, dressed in medieval armor, approached a helicopter, and when he got there, the rotors knocked on his helmet for a few moments.
Atkinson’s comical vein works well in the film, but the film’s humor doesn’t really work, and it even seems superfluous, as nowadays “serious” franchises such as the James Bond films or the Mission Impossible series also dare to use the tool of humor.
“To feel that the film’s sense of humour is more aimed at children, and to me, Johnny English’s crazy, misguided adventures do not reach the level of ingenuity and genius that Atkinson brings in the silent scenes of the Mr. Bean series.
The starting point of the film is eternal: Britain is in grave danger.
A cybercriminal broke into the British spy network’s super-secret online network and revealed the identities of all British agents to the greatest horror of on-call agent Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately got only such a small role in the film.
This could be the last nail in the coffin of the arrogant and divisive prime minister, whose political popularity is already in ruins: Emma Thompson practically plays Theresa May and brings everything out of the otherwise poorly written character.
His intelligence advisors outline to him that since all active agents have been identified, he must assign a retired agent to the job.
This retired agent, of course, is none other than the clumsy Johnny English, who has been working as a teacher in a prestigious school since his retirement, but he teaches children espionage in a different way from the curriculum – here, of course, there are some funny scenes, while English explains the basics of espionage in a kind of “Rocksuli” way.
English is quickly transported to Whitehall, where in the emergency briefing, he is reunited with his former, long-suffering squire, Bough, who is still played by Ben Miller.
Bough has since been married to a submarine captain whose mouth is always up to his ears – played by Vicki Pepperdine, who is destined for much better roles.
Thus, the bumbling pair of His Majesty’s National Security Service, Batman and Robin, jumps back into action and confronts Ophelia Bulletova, played by the beautiful Olga Kurylenko, as the true woman of destiny.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is increasingly enmeshed by the charismatic IT billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s digital problems: his name is Jason Volta, and he is played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their clown mission: they set fire to a fancy French restaurant disguised as a waiter, then sneak themselves into Volta’s luxury yacht in a frenzied mess, while English unleashes hell as he uses a VR headset to get to know Volta’s apartment.
These stages are needed to get to the finale, but no matter how cheerful and turn-of-the-moment it is, it might give the impression of a children’s film a little too much.
The end result is quite mediocre.
As with the other Johnny English films, I wondered: couldn’t the British film industry finally give Rowan Atkinson a role worthy of his talent?
UK Labour Party denies introducing a four-day working week while paying British workers five-day wages
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is working on a radical plan: a four-day working week, with workers working for five days' wages.
The party reportedly wants workers to benefit from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution by allowing CEOs to give employees extra days off thanks to increased revenue.
According to the plan, employees would be given a three-day weekend while taking home the same amount as before.
According to the sources, the idea “fits” into the party’s economic program, which aims to tip the balance on the workers’ side of the country.
The idea of a four-day working week is also supported by the Congress of Trade Unions, which believes that workers could benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told the Sunday Times: “The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
Although it will not happen overnight, the four-day working week is an idea that fits in well with the party’s programme to tip the balance in the economy towards the workers, and also fits into the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Workers’ Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party already campaigned in the 2017 parliamentary elections with the promise of a four-day working week.
The idea, however, does not enjoy the support of the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not part of the policies supported by the party, and the issue is not even on the agenda.”
Shadow finance minister John McDonnell presented his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy at a Labour conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to win back power from “faceless directors” and “beneficiaries” of utility companies.
If the shadow finance minister’s plans were carried out, the shareholders of water companies would not get their full profits back, as a Labour government would make “deductions” as a punishment for allegedly harmful activities.
McDonnell also confirmed that he planned to include workers on the board of directors and create Inclusive Ownership Funds, which would transfer 10% of the shares in private sector companies to employees, who would receive <0xC2><0xA3>500 in dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal on '60 Minutes' if FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
Following an FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, a final vote on Kavanaugh's election to the Supreme Court will be held at least a week later than originally scheduled. The question is whether the outcome of the investigation could create enough uncertainty for Republican representatives not to support Kavanaugh.
In a 60 Minutes Sunday interview, Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything to change their minds about.
Kennedy seemed less committed than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“That’s what I said before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the case broke, after the charges came up, and I asked him, ‘Have you done it?’
His answer was clear and decisive.”
However, Graham’s vote seems to be concrete.
“I’ve already made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take a very serious charge to change my mind,” Graham said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know that Brett emphatically denied the allegations,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the individuals named by Dr. Ford have corroborated the allegations.
It's a 36-year-old story.
I don’t think anything new will come out.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it managed to reduce poverty?
The annual New York City music festival, Global Citizen Festival, kicks off on Saturday with stars from around the world standing up for a truly noble cause: the global eradication of poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival will be held for the seventh time, and tens of thousands of people are expected to spend the Great Lawn of Central Park, where participants can not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also draw attention to the real purpose of the event: the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival was first held in 2012 as part of the Global Poverty project, which is run by an international advocacy group that aims to eradicate poverty by actively involving more people in the fight against poverty.
Free tickets to the concert (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) can be given to those who undertake certain tasks or “actions”, such as volunteering, sending an email to a senior politician, a phone call or any other meaningful activity to raise awareness of the project’s goal: the eradication of poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in achieving its goals over the past 12 years?
Is it really an effective way to reward people with concert tickets to convince others of the importance of action, or is it just another form of so-called “clicktivism” where people feel they have made a meaningful contribution to a cause by signing an online petition or writing a Twitter message?
Since 2011, Global Citizen data shows that more than 19 million “actions” have been carried out by project sponsors for a variety of purposes.
These actions have contributed to global leaders dedicating $37 billion to anti-poverty policies and commitments that could impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group claimed that 390 commitments and announcements came from their actions, of which $10 billion had already been paid out or raised through fundraising.
The group estimated that the money raised had a direct impact on the lives of nearly 649 million people.
The main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and contractors that aims to “help children reach their full potential.” The organization pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end hunger after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter messages from “global citizens.”
“With the support of the UK government and donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can place social injustice and malnutrition among the footnotes in history books,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition to the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also claims that after asking the UK in more than 5,000 acts to improve the nutrition of mothers and their children, the government has earmarked funds for the Power of Nutrition project, which will improve the nutrition of 5 million women and children.
One of the frequently asked questions posted on the Global Citizen website is “Why do you think extreme poverty can be eradicated?”.
The Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we get stuck and sometimes we fail.
But like previous civil rights and anti-segregation movements, we will achieve our goal because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will perform at this year’s event in New York, with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman hosting.
Home Secretary: U.S. would use naval ‘blockade’ to block Russian energy exports
“If necessary, Washington would even use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East,” U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke told the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia’s active presence in Syria, especially in operations carried out at the request of the legitimate Syrian government, is just an excuse for Russia to acquire new energy markets.
“I think they are only in the Middle East because they want to sell energy there, as they do in Eastern Europe and in the south of Europe,” Zinke said in a statement.
And the Home Secretary says there are ways to stop the Russians.
“The United States of America, with its navy, is able to ensure that the sea routes are open and can block them if necessary, so that Russian energy does not enter the markets,” Zinke said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event organized by the non-profit group Consumer Energy Alliance, which defines itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
In his speech, he compared Washington’s actions against Russia and Iran, noting that they are practically the same methods.
“Iran and Russia can be sanctioned economically in much the same way: using existing energy sources and introducing new ones,” Zinke said, while calling Russia a “one-dimensional economy” and pointing to the country’s dependence on fossil fuels.
The statements coincide with the Trump administration’s plan to export liquefied natural gas to Europe, pushing Russia out of the market, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
That’s why leading Trump administration officials, including the president himself, are urging Germany to back off the “incorrect” pipeline project called Nord Stream 2, which if implemented would make Germany a “hostage” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
According to the Kremlin, Washington is so vehemently opposed to the project for economic reasons, which is a manifestation of unfair competition.
“I assume that we share the same view that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to freely choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The attempt to convince the Americans backfired after Germany confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the German Confederation of Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy, as well as to stay away from the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I find it problematic when a third country interferes in our energy affairs,” Dieter Kempf, president of the German Confederation of Industries (BDI), told reporters after a recent meeting between Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren ‘seriously considering’ running for presidency in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the midterm elections, she would “consider” running for the presidency.
Warren confirmed at a town meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, that he was considering leaving.
“It’s time for women to get into Washington, D.C. and fix a dysfunctional government, and it’s also time for a woman to be president,” Warren said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.”
At the city council meeting, Warren criticized Donald Trump, saying he was taking the country “in the wrong direction.”
“I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” Warren said.
Warren has outspokenly criticized Trump and the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote, “Well, of course, there’s the need for an FBI investigation before the vote.”
But according to a poll released Thursday, most of Warren’s Massachusetts voters don’t think Warren should run for president in 2020.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolk’s Center for Policy Analysis and the Boston Globe, 58% of Massachusetts voters who voted for Warren “highly likely” believe the senator should not run for president, while
32% support Warren's candidacy for president.
According to the poll, the candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick would be supported by a majority, 38% would be against, and 48% would be against.
In the 2020 presidential election, top Democratic politicians such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont were mentioned.
According to the Associated Press, Biden has until January to decide whether to run.
Sarah Palin Track Referred to Palin’s PTSD at Donald Trump Meeting
26-year-old Track Palin served in Iraq for a year after reporting in September
He was arrested Monday night on domestic violence charges.
“What my son is going through, what he’s been going through since he came home, I understand the other families that are experiencing the terrible consequences of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers are coming home with,” Sarah Palin told the audience at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
He called the arrest of Palin’s son the “elephant in the room” and said that he, like other war veterans, had returned “changed and hardened, and kept thinking about whether there was due respect for the service that their comrades, pilots and all the other members of the army had done for the country.”
Track Palin was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence against a woman. Dan Bennett, a spokeswoman for the Wasilla Police Department, said that Track Palin also committed domestic violence while intoxicated with a gun, according to a report.
18 Member States and Washington D.C. support judicial review of asylum policy
Eighteen states and Washington, D.C., support a judicial review of the new U.S. asylum policy that prohibits asylum seekers fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 different member states, as well as Washington, D.C., wrote an expert letter on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who attacks policy in court, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case of Grace vs. Sessions, initiated by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
The woman claims that her partner and her “sons of a violent gang” abused her, but US officials rejected her asylum request on July 20.
The woman is being held in Texas.
Prosecutors in the Grace-supporting states have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as places from which many asylum applications to the United States originate, with ongoing problems of gang violence and domestic violence in these countries.
The new U.S. refugee policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (BIA) that allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum while fleeing domestic violence.
Attorney General Karl Racine of Washington, D.C., said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal, and international law.”
“Under federal law, all asylum applications must be assessed on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the case, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” the letter said.
The U.S. Attorney’s office also said the policy of refusing immigration harmed the U.S. economy because immigrants were more likely to become entrepreneurs and “fill the lowest-level jobs.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June ordered asylum judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and criminal gangs.
“Asylum is granted to those who leave their country for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or a well-founded fear of being persecuted or persecuted for political reasons,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum is not designed to solve all the problems that people around the world face on a daily basis, no matter how serious they may be.
Desperate rescue operation in Palu, death toll doubled, rescue teams race against time
The situation of the survivors is becoming more and more hopeless.
“Everyone is very tense,” says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she soothes her feverish son in an evacuation center in disaster-stricken Palu.
Ambulances bring the bodies every minute.
We barely have any drinking water."
Some residents have returned to their destroyed home to salvage what is still salvageable from the soaks.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, which were also damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, have been unable to supply the people.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris with a broken spine and shoulder, were taken to the Palu Military Hospital, where they were treated outside the hospital for high-intensity aftershocks.
The man’s eyes filled with tears as he recalled how the hotel room on the fifth floor, in which he and his wife and daughter were staying, trembled in the destructive tremor.
“There was no time to escape.
“I think I’m trapped inside the walls,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that her family had come to town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and my daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Propaganda
The U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of spreading propaganda in the U.S. press, a week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper highlighting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade relations.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred to an ad in the China Daily Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, last Wednesday while accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections. China denies the accusation.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election, according to some U.S. officials speaking to Reuters, marks a new stage in Washington’s increasingly strong action against China to put pressure on China.
While it is not uncommon for foreign governments to promote trade with their countries through advertisements, there is a growing trade war between Beijing and Washington, where new tariffs are imposed on each other’s imports.
According to US and Chinese experts, the Chinese tariffs imposed at the beginning of the trade war were aimed at the exporters of countries in which Trump and the Republican Party are popular, including Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa for several terms, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses, as the state of Iowa exported significant amounts of agricultural products to China.
Branstad wrote in an op-ed in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that "China continues to annoy our country by publishing propaganda in our own free press."
“The Chinese government is taking advantage of the cherished American tradition of freedom of speech and press by spreading propaganda in paid ads placed on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“But if we go to a Beijing newspaper vendor, we can hardly find any critical articles. The Chinese press does not at all reflect the different and different views of the Chinese people on the increasingly gloomy growth prospects of the Chinese economy, since the media is under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party.”
Branstad added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish" his article, but did not name the newspaper.
Analysts say Republicans could alienate female voters before midterm elections with Kavanaugh scandal
Analysts say it may be counterproductive for many high-ranking Republican politicians to defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the crossfire of allegations of sexual harassment, which could result in a loss of support for women in particular, ahead of the midterm elections.
The incident sparked strong emotions, and most Republicans publicly said they would continue to vote for Kavanaugh.
These statements cannot be taken back, says Grant Reeher, a political scientist at Siracusa University’s Maxwell School, in an article in The Hill on Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubts that the FBI investigation initiated by Republican Senator Jeff Flake at the last minute will be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, tomorrow and in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national spokesperson for MoveOn, a progressive group in Washington, D.C., on Friday.
Mic reported Friday morning that some protesters in the Senate corridor chanted “November is coming!” as the Republican-controlled Justice Committee, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, decided not to withdraw Kavanaugh’s nomination.
“There will be an amazing leap in democratic enthusiasm and motivation,” said independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg.
“A lot of people say it’s already been very high, and it’s true.
But it could be even higher, especially among insecure female voters in the suburbs and young people (ages 18 to 29) who, while not enthusiastic about the president, often don’t vote.”
Analysts had assumed before Ford's public testimony that he could strike back at the Republicans if they continue to stand up for Brett Kavanaugh. Since then, Ford has described in detail in his testimony why he accuses the Supreme Court nominee of sexual harassment.
“The Republican Party is on shaky ground,” former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele told NBC News earlier this week.
“This isn’t just about the committee vote and the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be appointed, it’s also about how the Republicans handled the issue and how they treated Ford,” said Guy Cecil, U.S. director of priorities.
However, Americans seem to be quite divided over whether Ford or Kavanaugh's testimony is true. Kavanaugh is believed by slightly more people than Ford.
According to a new YouGov survey, 41% of respondents believed Ford’s testimony, and 35% of Kavanaugh’s respondents said the same.
Furthermore, 38% of respondents said that Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying in his testimony, while only 30% of respondents believed Ford to be so.
Flake’s motion prompted the FBI to investigate Ford’s claims, as well as Kavanaugh’s accuser Deborah Ramirez’s claims, according to the Guardian.
A week ago, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had drunkenly harassed him at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee showed him his genitals at a party in the 1980s when they were both studying at Yale.
The Inventor of the World Wide Web Would Launch a New Internet to Oppose Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open-source platform, Solid.
With Solid, users can choose where they want to store their data and who has access to each piece of information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was "to gain control of the world".
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data warehouse,” also known as a POD.
This can include lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like having Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all available from the same browser.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who has access to their data.
The company calls this “the realization of the right of individuals to self-determination over their data.”
According to John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, the company’s mission is to provide the resources, processes, and skills needed to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contract developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt.
Berners-Lee said he and his team would not ask “Facebook and Google to introduce a technology that will bring about a complete change that will turn the business models of companies upside down overnight.”
“We don’t ask permission from them.”
In a post published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the network that is newly built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been a key voice in recent months in the debate over the neutrality of the Internet.
Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am endlessly optimistic about the next era of the Internet,” Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann Vikt<0xC3><0xB3>ria's First World War pastor celebrated
The only Anglican priest to receive the Victoria Cross celebrates his hometown 100 years after his heroic act in World War I.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann was awarded the Order of Merit in the September 29, 1918, attacks in Bellenglis and Lehacourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, so he could never know that he had earned the highest award from the British Armed Forces.
The memorial stone was unveiled by two of his grandsons at a ceremony in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was “symbolic” that the memorial stone was handed over exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s meritorious act.
According to the London Gazette, Lt. Col. Bernard Vann led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918, "in the midst of thick fog and heavy gun and machine-gun fire."
Later, he rushed to the front line and, with "exceptional heroism", led the battalion, then single-handedly attacked a field artillery detachment, disposing of three of its members.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just one month before the end of the war.
“I know I can never live up to what my grandfather did, and it taught me humility,” Michael Vann, 72, said in a statement.
After the march led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, Michael Vann and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath at the memorial stone.
Michael Vann said he was honored to have played a role in the ceremony, adding: "The valor of a real hero is demonstrated by the number of people who later pay tribute to him."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch the Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa the pig
Imagine you've been up all night watching the thrilling Bellator 206, and the broadcast is cancelled.
The San José show featured 13 encounters, six of which were broadcast live at night as part of the main show on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom.
At 6 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, the English audience was surprised to see Peppa the pig instead of the game.
This was resented by many who had stayed up until the early hours of the morning because of this conflict.
Instead of an MMA game, the children’s cartoon was described by one fan as a “some kind of sick joke” on Twitter.
“Under state regulations, content of this kind can no longer be broadcast on the network at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s programming,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of communications and marketing, said in a statement.
“Yes, it’s Peppa the pig’s time.”
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said the show would be rescheduled to include UK viewers.
“I think we can definitely fix this with repetition,” Coker said.
“However, since it is 6 a.m. on Sunday, we cannot remedy the situation until our Sunday, which is Monday in their case.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the show switched over, there were a lot of messages, and, well, most of them weren't exactly friendly.
At first, we thought we had a technical problem, so we tried to fix it.
But that's not what we were talking about. We ran into a legal problem.
But I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
There will be only five games in the program, instead of the six we have had so far – we really wanted to please the spectators, but we miscalculated.
It was an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley struggled with a minority complex because of his sexual orientation
Diving Olympian Tom Daley said he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexual orientation at a young age, but that he was motivated to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until high school that “not everyone is like him.”
In an interview with Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, Lauren Laverne said she was standing up for gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He added that since he became a parent, he has been less interested in the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-lived show, missed several months due to illness.
Invited to Laverne's first show as a "shipwreck," Daley said he felt "less than anyone else" when he was young because "it was socially unacceptable to love both boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, it is the feeling of inferiority and difference that gives me the strength to achieve my success.”
He wanted to prove that he was worth “something” so that he wouldn’t disappoint everyone when his sexual orientation came to light.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become a well-known representative of the LGBT community and, taking advantage of his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia, has called on governments around the world to decriminalize homosexuality in as many countries as possible.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to live his life openly and without negative consequences, and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said he was "totally surprised" when he fell in love with another man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley and the Oscar-winning screenwriter, who are 20 years his senior, got married last year and said the age difference had never been a problem.
“If you go through so much when you’re young,” he said, “when you’re 14 years old at your first Olympics and your father died of cancer three years later, it’s hard to find someone your own age who’s had similar extreme experiences.”
In June, the couple adopted a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, which, according to Daley's own admission, completely changed his attitude towards the world.
“If you had asked me this question last year, I would have said the most important thing is to win a gold medal,” he said.
There are more important things than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The child's name was named after Daley's father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not want to accept that he was going to die, and one of his last questions was whether he had the tickets for the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t answer him, ‘Dad, you’re not going to be in the front row anymore,’” he said.
“I held her hand when she stopped breathing, but I couldn’t accept until that moment that my father was not invulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I felt that this is what I’ve been dreaming of all my life: jumping in front of an audience at the Olympic Games at home, there’s nothing better than that,” he said.
Heather's song "Small Proud" helped her a lot during her Olympic training, and she still gets goosebumps when she hears it.
Desert Island Discs starts Sunday at 11:15 local time on BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson was out of shape and benched Saturday at the Ryder Cup
Phil Mickelson could set a new record by taking part in his 47th round of the Ryder Cup on Sunday, but will have to regain his form if he doesn’t want this milestone to remain in his memory as an unpleasant experience.
Mickelson plays for the record 12 times at the biennial event, but due to his performance in Saturday's four-ball and four-ball games, team captain Jim Furyk put him on the bench.
Instead of being at the center of the action as so many times when the United States had to fight for victory in a major tournament, the player now spends half the day cheering for his team, the other half practicing on the pitch and trying to correct the mistakes that weakened his game.
At the height of his career, he was never one of the most punctual clubs, so the 48-year-old player doesn’t really have the narrow course of Le Golf National, where the high grass makes him pay a high price for a foul shot.
And as if the pitch itself wasn’t scary enough, Mickelson will face the punctual English champion Francesco Molinari in Sunday’s ninth game, who won all four of his starting games with Tommy Fleetwood this week.
If Americans start with a four-point gap ahead of the 12 individual games, Mickelson’s game could be crucial.
Furyk says he trusts the player, but what else can he say?
“He is fully aware of his role in today’s development, patting me on the back, holding me in his arms and promising me that he would be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
– Extremely confident.
He is one of the biggest and has done a lot for the team in the past and over the past week.
I didn’t want to play two games for him.
I planned more, but in the given situation, we decided that this is the best solution.
He wants to be on the field like everyone else.”
Mickelson's performance on Sunday will break Nick Faldo's record, the highest number of games ever played in the Ryder Cup.
With this, you can close a series in the Ryder Cup that falls far short of the player's individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven draws, but Furyk said the veteran's presence brought no tangible benefits to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to joke with others, he’s a great team member,” he explained.
“I think the younger players also enjoyed the games against him, and it’s good to see that.
His presence goes beyond the strict sense of the game."
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, captain of the European team, knows that they can easily lose their advantage.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that even if you have a significant advantage in the final day of the Ryder Cup, you can easily turn your back on luck.
The Danish player made her debut in a 1997 Valderrama match, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, and by the end they had barely managed to keep a head start to the 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 win.
“We always have to remind ourselves that even though we had a big lead at Valderrama, we won by a hair’s breadth, and we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost,” said Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, who is seen in the picture after winning the 2018 class 5–3 on Friday and yesterday, leading 10–6 at Le Golf National.
“It’s enough to think about the races of previous years and everyone can see that the game is not over yet.
Tomorrow you'll have to play with all your might.
So let's go and do whatever it takes to win.
We can't relax until the dots are on the board.
We have a goal, which is to win this trophy, and that's all we need to focus on right now.
“As I said before, I’m mostly focused on the 12 players in our team, but we also have to look at the other side, who happens to be one of the biggest players in the world.”
Proud of the team’s performance on the difficult track, Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn added: “I would never make predictions in this situation.
Tomorrow is a completely different day.
Then it all depends on individual achievements, which is completely different from team play.
It’s a great feeling to play in pairs when things are going well, but when you stand out as an individual, every aspect of who you are as a golfer turns out to be.
That’s what we need to make the players understand, so that tomorrow they can make the best of themselves on the pitch.
They will have to break away from their partner, who will also have to do their best.”
Unlike Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, the opposing team's captain, Jim Furyk, expressed confidence that his players would perform better individually than in pairs, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk personally experienced both sides of the last day resurrections: he was part of the winning team in Brookline, then on the losing side after the European team’s “Medinah miracle” feat.
“I remember every damn word,” he said when asked about the encouragement given by captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999.
“We’ve got 12 big games tomorrow, but we’re getting off to a start that’s as fast as Brookline, as we saw in Medinah.
If one team really gets into it, it puts a lot of pressure on the opposing players in the middle matches.
We’ve put the order together and prepared our players so that they can do a miracle tomorrow.”
Thomas was given the task of leading the effort to turn the job around, playing against Rory McIlroy in the first match, followed by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the first half of the European team.
“I chose this order because I think this is how the picture is put together from start to finish,” Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn said.
Germany's latest warship has been delayed
The German Navy’s latest frigate was due to be commissioned in 2014 to replace aging Cold War war ships, but due to various system failures and exponentially increasing costs, it will have to wait at least until next year.
The inauguration of the flagship of the brand-new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigate "Rheinland-Palatinate" has been postponed until the first half of 2019, Die Zeit weekly reported, citing an army spokesman.
The ship was initially scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but the ongoing delays made the fate of the large-scale project very difficult.
In 2007, the navy ordered four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships to replace the Bremen-class aging frigates.
It is believed to be equipped with a high-fired gun and a variety of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and cloaking technology, including a signal attenuator that reduces the ship’s radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Another important feature is that it requires less maintenance, which in practice means that these latest frigates can be put into service for up to two years away from mother ports.
However, because of the project’s ongoing delay, these high-tech warships, which could give Germany a sense of power overseas, may become obsolete as soon as they are finally put into service, Die Zeit noted.
The heavyweight frigate F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to inaugurate the ship and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had sent a ship back to the manufacturer.
There is little information about the reasons for the return, but the German media mentions several critical "software and hardware bugs" that would render the warship unusable in a combat operation.
The lack of software is a major problem, as Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class warships will only have 120 sailors on board, which is only half the crew of the old Bremen-class frigates.
It was also discovered that the ship was extremely overweight, which worsened its performance and made it impossible for the Navy to make any further modifications later.
The 7,000-ton "Rhineland-Palatinate" is said to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships commissioned by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from faulty components, the increase in the total cost of the project, including the training of the crew, is a growing problem.
According to some sources, the cost of the project has already reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), while the initial draft was expected to be 2.2 billion euros.
The problems with the new frigates are particularly important in light of the warnings that Germany’s maritime presence is declining.
Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament’s national defence committee, recently admitted that the navy is “starting to run out of warships that can be taken.”
According to the official, the problem has become a self-exciting process in the meantime, as the old ships had to be dismantled, but there are no more ships to replace the ones that fell out.
He expressed concern that not even one of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigates had been able to join the navy.
The National Trust investigates the secret lives of bats
New research is underway on a Scottish Highlands estate to find out how bats exploit the landscape’s features while hunting.
The researchers hope the results will provide new insights into the behaviour of single flying mammals that could benefit future conservation initiatives.
Scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will study the behaviour of common and soprano dwarf bats, as well as brown long-eared bats and aquatic bats, in the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
At appropriate points in the area, special recording devices are placed to record the activities of the bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will use hand-held detectors to collect mobile data.
Detailed analysis of the sound material of the recordings can determine the frequency of the bat sounds and which species is doing what.
The researchers will also produce a habitat map and report, which will help to determine in detail how the animals behave in relation to the landscape.
NTS conservation adviser Rob Dewar hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important for bats and how they are used by which species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as meadow formation, and how best to conserve forested areas for bats and other affected species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bat populations have declined significantly over the past century.
Construction and land development work is disrupting the sleeping places of animals and reducing their living space.
Wind turbines and public lighting are also a risk factor for them, as are flypapers, certain chemicals used in building materials, and attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are actually not completely blind.
Because they are nocturnal predators, however, they rely more on their hearing when hunting for prey than on their sight.
Using sophisticated techniques based on the reflection of ultrasound, they can determine the exact position of insects as well as objects in their path.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
They work with ten qualified specialists who regularly carry out studies and sleeper examinations, and from time to time also take part in rescue work.
The organisation created Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
According to land manager David Thompson, the area is an ideal habitat for bats.
"There's a great place for bats in Threave," he said.
– There are old buildings, lots of old trees and everything else that is needed for a good living space.
But there’s a lot we don’t know about bats, and thanks to our work here and in other similar areas, we can learn more about what they need to feel great about themselves.”
He also highlighted the importance of making sure that bats are present before renovating buildings, as the destruction of a single colony could result in the death of 400 females and juveniles, which could lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals, their destruction, harassment and disturbance of their habitat are prohibited by law.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a representative of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, also asked for the public’s help.
“There is still a lot we don’t know about bats, and we have almost no information on the status of the population of most domestic species.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations, lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the allegations of rape against him as "fake news" and said others wanted to use his name to "get to know".
The football player’s lawyers are ready to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel.
A Portuguese squad member and Juventus striker was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
The woman said the athlete paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
Ronaldo, 33, told his 142 million fans on Instagram that the news was “a lie.”
“No, no, no, no and no.
What was said about me today is all lies,” the five-time Golden Ball player told the camera.
“They want to use my name to get into the public consciousness.
It happens.
They want to be famous with my name, that's the life of a public figure.
I’m a happy person and my life is fine,” the player added with a smile.
The allegations, which have been described as “unacceptable, privacy-destroying,” prompted Ronaldo’s lawyers to seek legal action against Der Spiegel.
According to lawyer Christian Schertz, the player will file a claim for damages “for moral damages caused to an extent commensurate with the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights committed in recent years.”
The incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly walked up to the athlete’s apartment where he had anal-raped a woman, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Attorney’s Office in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told him he was “99 percent a good boy” except for “one percent.”
Based on the information in the documents, Ronaldo admitted that he had had sexual relations with the woman, but said that it was by mutual consent.
Mayorga also said he went to the police and had his injuries reported in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because he was “afraid of reprisals” and “public humiliation.”
The 34-year-old woman wants to repeal the agreement now, as the trauma caused by this case continues to embitter her life.
Ronaldo was about to be transferred to Manchester United from Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer the Italian giant Juve bought the player for 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK will ‘regret forever’ the loss of car factories
The UK will “regret forever” if it loses its position as the world’s leading car maker after Brexit, Enterprise Secretary Greg Clark said.
Toyota UK said in a statement to the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the carmaker will be forced to temporarily shut down production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
According to the Japanese automaker, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, delays at the borders could result in job losses.
The Toyota Auris and Avensis plant in Burnaston produced 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be production downtime at the plant,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK (including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) have expressed concern about the possibility of the country leaving the EU without a deal on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, has announced that it will close its Oxford plant producing Minis for a month after Brexit.
Car manufacturers are most concerned about the risks to their supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers based in the UK and other EU countries.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, border disruptions could lead to production delays and shortages of parts, according to industry representatives.
Toyota said it would be impossible to store more than a day’s worth of spare parts at its Derbyshire plant and would have to shut down production.
Clark said her plan for future relations with the EU, known as Theresa May Chequers, is “precisely designed to avoid checks at the border that cause delays.”
“We want to reach an agreement on the best possible terms, not only to reap the benefits of our current successes, but also to open up new opportunities,” he said on BBC Radio 4 Today.
“Not only Toyota, but other manufacturers can confirm that we absolutely need to maintain our highly successful supply chain today.”
Toyota could not say for how long production would be halted, but warned that the cumulative costs could harm the factory’s competitiveness in the long run, ultimately resulting in job losses.
According to Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and is now representing the Unite trade union, union members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, jobs that have been lost will never be recovered.”
A government spokesman said: “We have developed a precise and feasible plan for future EU relations.”
Trump and Rosenstein meeting may be postponed again, White House says
“Another week may postpone” the high-profile meeting between Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Donald Trump as the dispute over the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said in a statement on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian influence over the election, possible ties between Trump’s advisers and the Russian government, and possible obstruction of justice by Trump.
Washington has been speculating for months on whether Trump will eventually dismiss the deputy attorney general, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence.
According to the New York Times this month, Rosenstein was considering coming to the meeting wearing a wire to record his conversation with the president, and the question was raised whether the 25th Amendment would allow Trump to be replaced.
Rosenstein denied what was said.
But last Monday, he visited the White House and was rumored to be filing his resignation.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who then had an apparition to the United Nations in New York, was announced Thursday.
Trump said he would “not like” to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid clashing with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing at which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women suspected of sexual misconduct, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying a crucial Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, visited Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he replied: “We don’t have a set date yet, we might even set it this week, but in light of the ongoing cases in the Supreme Court, I see a chance for another one-week delay.
We'll find out soon, and I'll notify the press, as always."
Some journalists, however, were skeptical of the statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the host of the show, also asked about the reason for this.
Sanders responded that the rarity of press conferences was not due to his dislike of the “sensationalist” behavior of television reporters, but added: “I don’t dispute the fact that they are indeed sensationalists.”
Next, he suggested that direct meetings between Trump and representatives of the press will take place more often.
“The president gives more question-and-answer interviews than any previous president,” he said. He even added, without substantiating the claim: “We looked at the numbers.”
There will continue to be press conferences, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it’s light years better than talking to me.”
We often try to do that, and there have been a number of such events over the past few weeks, so you can talk to the President of the United States in person instead of the White House press conferences.”
Trump regularly answers questions from reporters when he leaves the White House or attends public events or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences alone are rare.
The reason for this may be inferred from what happened this week, when the President performed an unusual and sometimes bizarre performance in New York in front of the assembled journalists.
The head of the Ministry of Health wrote a letter to NHS Scotland employees in the European Union because of concerns about Brexit
In a letter, the head of the Ministry of Health expressed the country’s gratitude to the Scottish NHS employees from the European Union, and highlighted that he hopes that they will stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the United Kingdom was expected to leave.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the costs of settled applications for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the withdrawal have continued and a decision is expected in the autumn.
The UK Government has also embarked on the preparation of a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of what an unsettling time this must be for you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the efforts of each and every member of the team, no matter what country they come from.
Staff from different EU Member States and other countries bring valuable experience and expertise to the work of the Ministry of Health, which has a positive impact on patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is fully your home and we would very much like you to stay with us."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
The Tennessee State Tigers' linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
“He walked out to the shoreline and just collapsed,” Reed said.
The coaching team and medical staff members first gave Abercrombie oxygen at the edge of the field, then put her on a stretcher and took her to further examinations.
A Tennessee State official in Nashville, Tennessee, told WSMV reporter Chris Harris that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that he "does not know any further details about the type and extent of the injury" while Tennessee State is working to determine exactly when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore who was put on hold for a year, spent his first season with the Tennessee State team, where he transferred from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had a total of five successful tackles before leaving the track, so he is now at 18 for the season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher tax on real estate bought in the UK
According to Toryk’s new plan, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher tax on property purchased in the UK, and the resulting extra income would be used to support the homeless.
The move would neutralise Corbyn’s success among young voters.
Tax increases for those not taxed in the UK
According to the State Treasury, this would amount to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year, which would be used to support the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher tax on property bought in the UK, and the extra revenue will be used to support the homeless, Theresa May is preparing to announce at a press conference today.
The move is likely to counter Jeremy Corbyn’s success among young voters by promising more affordable housing and high-income measures.
The increase will affect individuals and businesses that do not tax in the UK, and the extra income will be used to fight homelessness.
The additional fee added to the current fee, which is to be calculated in addition to the higher fee charged two years ago on second dwellings and real estate purchased for expenditure purposes, can reach up to three percent.
The Treasury expects the measure to generate revenue of <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built London properties are bought by non-UK citizens, causing a significant price increase that is making it increasingly difficult for first-time home buyers.
Many of the country’s wealthy districts have become “ghost cities,” especially in the capital, as many foreign buyers spend much of their time outside the country.
The bill came just weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a tax cut to help young people wait for their first home.
He personally blames the large construction companies for keeping real estate prices high, who have become accustomed to buying up and leaving the land unoccupied. He asked May to abolish quotas on affordable housing and do something about the “housing market shame” that has developed in the country.
Corbyn announced notable proposals for a series of housing reforms, including rent controls and the elimination of unjustified evictions.
It would also give the councils more powers and opportunities to build new houses.
May said: “Last year I said I wanted to dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the English dream and making life better for each generation.
To do this, the property market situation needs to be resolved.
“Britain will continue to be, as always, open to those who want to live, work and start a family here.
However, it is not right that individuals living outside the country, as well as foreign companies, should be able to buy real estate as easily as hard-working British citizens.
The dreams of one’s own home have become almost unattainable for too many, and the unworthy state of homelessness has become too attainable for too many.”
Jack Ross: "My main wish is to be manager of the Scottish team"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross said his “greatest desire” was to be the manager of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish coach would love to take on the challenge of resurrecting the North-East club, which is currently third in the Premier League, just three points behind the first place finisher.
He moved to Stadium of Light after successfully returning the St. Mirren team to the Scottish Premier League the previous season.
“As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
"Unfortunately, I was only able to get into the reserves," Ross told BBC Sportsound.
“When I was a kid, I watched a lot of the Scottish team play in Hampden with my father, and something always drew me back to them.
But now I only have a chance if I succeed as a club manager.”
As manager of Sunderland, Ross' predecessors include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach isn’t nervous about following in the footsteps of such big names and has previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“At the moment, I’m measuring my success by whether I can get the team back to first class.
“If you take the structure and facilities of the club, it definitely belongs in the first-class league,” he said.
“It will not be easy to get back, but it is more than likely that I will only consider my activities here a success if I can get the club back.”
Ross began his management career just three years ago after serving as a substitute coach for Dumbarton and spending 15 months in the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Aolla to recover after the team fell back to the third division and, with St. Mirren on the verge of relegation, won the league title the following season.
Ross says he feels more confident now than he has ever felt in his playing career, whether with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren or Hamilton Academical.
“It was a really decisive moment,” he recalled his time as Alloa’s coach.
“I definitely thought management was better for me than being a player.
That sounds weird, because I did a good job, I lived a good life, and I even had some really memorable moments.
However, players’ lives are sometimes very hard.
There's a lot to go through every single week.
Of course, I still have to cope with the stress and pressure of work, but the management tasks lie with me.
I’ve always been interested in management, and now that I’ve tasted it, I feel the best about myself in my adult life.”
The full interview will be aired on Sportssound’s Sunday show on 30 September from 12:00 to 13:00 local time on Radio Scotland.
According to a study, the best time to drink beer is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
In the summer heatwave, the turnover of pubs in England in difficulty increased significantly, but restaurant chains are still under great pressure.
According to the data collected, the revenue of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while that of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, an employee at CGA, the business consulting firm that compiled the statistics, said: “Due to the sunny season and the longer-than-expected appearance of England at the World Cup, the trend of the previous month continued in July, when pubs saw a 2.8% increase in revenue, with the difference that restaurants saw an even larger decline.
The 1.8% decline in restaurant revenue in June worsened further in July.
Pubs and bars selling mostly alcohol performed best, with growth even higher than the drop-out rate at restaurants.
Pubs that prefer to serve food were also unpleasantly affected by the prolonged sunshine, although not nearly as dramatically as the operators of the restaurants.
It seems that people prefer to drink at this time.
Company-run pubs and bars grew 6.6% in beverage revenue this month, while food revenues fell 3%.”
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality RSM analyst, said: “These results follow a trend that has been evident since the end of April.
Weather and major social and sporting events continue to be the main revenue driver for the entertainment and hospitality industry.
Unsurprisingly, restaurant chains are in a difficult situation, and the annual drop in revenue of 4.8% can be particularly painful due to ongoing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for restaurant operators, and it will only become clear over time whether the milder weather experienced in August will bring relief in this area as well.”
Total revenue growth for pubs and restaurants, including newly opened spaces, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowing pace of new brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which tracks sales in the UK hospitality sector (pubs, bars and restaurants) and is widely recognised as an industry benchmark, collects and analyses performance data from a <0xC2><0xA3>9bn group of 47 operators.
One in five children have a social media account that they hide from their parents
One in five children (even 11 years old) have a social media account that they keep from their parents and teachers
According to a survey of 20,000 high school students, the number of “Insta-fake pages” is increasing
The fear of sharing sexual content is increasing.
20% of students say they have a “main” account that their parents can see
One in five children (even at the age of 11) create a social media account that they hide from adults.
According to a survey of 20,000 high school students, the number of “Insta fake accounts” is rapidly increasing, referring to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The fear of sharing sexual content is growing.
20% of students said they have a spotless "main" account that their parents can see, but also create private accounts.
A mother who accidentally stumbled upon her 13-year-old daughter’s secret page found a teen’s profile that said, “Rape me.”
According to a survey conducted by Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC), representing the directors and principals of Digital Awareness UK and independent schools, 40% of 11-18 year olds have two profiles and 50% admit to having private accounts.
“I’m concerned that so many teens feel the need to create an online space where parents and teachers can’t reach them,” HMC president Mike Buchanan said in a statement.
Eilidh Doyle will be the ‘voice of the athletes’ in the Scottish Athletic Association
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Association at the annual board meeting.
Doyle, Scotland’s most successful athlete, and its chairman, Ian Beattie, said the sport’s extensive international experience over the past decade would be of invaluable help to its decision-makers.
“Eilidh is highly respected in Scotland, the UK and the international athletics community and his presence will help the development of Scottish athletics,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am happy to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really help the Scottish sporting leaders.”
He won two of the four Olympic gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics in 200m and 400m, but was confined to a wheelchair due to a temporary cerebral circulation disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that in time it would be decided if I would recover at all.
With hard work, but I managed to fully recover, I can walk again, today I go to agility training!
Thank you for the many encouraging messages.”
Breast-Sucking Advertisement Like Mothers Cows Shares Online Community
An online advertisement by a breast pump company likened breastfeeding mothers to milking cows has sparked a heated debate.
Elvie claims to have developed “the world’s first silent, wearable breast pump” and advertised their product in an ironic commercial evoking music videos that showed how much freedom the device gives to mothers who are milking.
Four real mothers dance in a cowshed full of straw, while in the background you hear the words, “Yes, I’m milking myself, I don’t have a tail” and “If I hadn’t noticed, these aren’t udders, they’re my breasts.”
The chorus reads: “I pump, pump, make the kids eat big, pump, pump, milk the girls.”
The advertisement on the company’s Facebook page quickly became the subject of online debate.
The video received 77,000 views and hundreds of mixed-received comments. Many say that advertising makes a mockery of the "horror" of the dairy industry.
“It’s very tasteful to advertise the product with cows.
Like us, their bodies only produce milk if they give birth to offspring, but their calves are taken from them within days.”
The Elvie breast pump can be discreetly placed in a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment says: “Yes, it is terrible for the mother animal and the calf.
But why not use them to sell breast pumps to mothers who can have their babies?"
Someone else added, “A totally insensitive ad.”
Others stood up to protect the ad, with one woman admitting that she thought the video was "terrible funny."
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought it if I still breast-fed.
I felt like a cow, too.
It's a crazy commercial, so I'm not trying to see it anymore.
“The product is brilliant,” he wrote.
Another commentator says: “This is a funny advertisement at work or in a toilet for milking mothers who feel like ‘cows’ because of it.
It is not the dairy industry that praises or condemns it."
At the end of the video, the women show that they had the discreet breast pump in their bras the whole time they were dancing.
The campaign is based on the feeling that women who use breast pumps sometimes feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump, on the other hand, is quiet, does not use wires and pipes, it can be discreetly placed in a nursing bra, so women can move freely, hold their baby in their hands or even move out during breast suction.
Ana Balarin, co-owner and communications director at Mother, said: “Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product, so it had to be advertised in a bold, provocative way.
By pointing out the parallel between women who milk their milk and the milking cows, we wanted to draw attention to the challenges of using breast pumps and, in a funny way, to show how our breast pump gives you a sense of freedom compared to that.”
This isn't the first time Elvie's breast pump has made the news.
At London Fashion Week, a mother of two walked into the catwalk wearing Marta Jakubowski’s dress while using the product.
Hundreds of Child Migrants Secretly Moved to Camp at Texas Border
The number of child migrants in detention has reached a record level, while the number of monthly border crossings has not changed much. This is partly explained by the fact that due to the harsh rhetoric and measures taken so far by the Trump administration, it is more difficult to find inclusive homes for them.
They are typically illegal immigrants themselves, and they fear that their chances of staying in the country would be worsened if they applied to take in the children.
This threat was exacerbated in June when it was announced that parents applying for a place to stay and adults living in the same household would have to give fingerprints and this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, executive director of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said in a statement to Congress last week that dozens of people had been arrested who had applied to receive unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
“Eighty per cent of those applying for admission and those living in the same household are in the country illegally, and a significant number of them are convicted criminals.
Therefore, we will continue to search for such individuals,” Albence said.
To speed up the process for children, new rules have been introduced that require some of them to appear in court within one month of their arrest, instead of the previous 60 days, social workers say.
Many people log on to the court through a videoconference call instead of appearing in person to apply for a residence permit.
If the judge does not grant legal protection, the immigrant will be quickly deported.
In recent months, social workers and system workers have reported that the longer detentions take, the more nervous and depressed children become, and the risk of violent outbursts or escape attempts increases.
Human rights defenders say these risks are exacerbated by a larger facility such as Tornill<0xC3><0xB3>, where the number of children makes it more difficult to identify those in need of psychological care.
They added that not giving children enough time to prepare or say goodbye to friends before moving them to such a facility would expose them to even greater trauma.
Syria calls for immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish “occupational forces”
Speaking in front of the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, despite eight years of civil war in the country, called on Syrian refugees to return to their home countries.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces entered Syrian territory illegally, citing the fight against terrorism, and “that’s how they will be treated.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem said the war on terror in Syria would end “soon” with more than 360,000 people killed and millions displaced since 2011.
He said Damascus would continue its “holy fight to cleanse the entire territory of Syria” of terrorist groups and “illegal foreign presences.”
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, most of them training and advising Kurdish forces and Arab militias fighting Bashar al-Assad.
France has sent more than 1,000 troops to the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem said the conditions were right for them to return, and that only “some Western countries” were arousing “irrational fears” and deterring refugees from returning home.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to help the population return home,” he said.
“They made politics out of a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and his opposition to end the war.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone around the rebels’ last major stronghold, Idlib, could facilitate further negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented Russian-backed Syrian government forces from launching a large-scale attack on the province, which has a population of three million.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement lays down "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would only be directed against jihadists, including the al-Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, which "must be eradicated".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene a committee of government and opposition delegates to draft a post-war Syrian constitution and prepare for elections.
Moualem's terms include the Syrian government's participation in the committee, for example, only "revision of certain articles of the current constitution", and warns against any outside interference in the process.
That’s why Trump will be re-elected.
Following this logic, Trump will certainly be re-elected in 2020, unless the hopes of many liberal viewers come true and a impeachment procedure or a scandal prematurely terminates his presidency.
We can be sure that this will be “the most dramatic presidential finale of all time.”
For now, though, viewers are enjoying the show.
Since 2014, CNN has nearly doubled its primetime viewership to 1.05 million, and MSNBC has nearly tripled its primetime viewership to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News attracts an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time instead of 1.7 million four years ago, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC is the most watched cable show with a 3.5 million audience on the night of major news days.
“It attracts us like fire because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, executive producer of ABC’s drama series “The Appointed Survivor.” In this series, a low-ranking cabinet minister sits in the chair after the Capitol is destroyed in an attack.
Nell Scovell, author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys‘ Club,” said:
Here’s a quote from a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election:
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
“Why,” Scovell asked him.
“Because he made me laugh,” the driver replied.
This is the fun of chaos.
Of course, unlike television series, stories from Washington may determine the fate of cases like Roe vs. Wade’s precedent, whether immigrant families can reunite and the stability of the world economy.
Only a very narrow group of people can ignore these facts.
However, it is no longer part of responsible information, when we have been watching for the sixth hour a debate show about the authenticity of the anonymous background conversations used in Bob Woodward’s book “Fear”, or about Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (“what kind of a garment of embodied arrogance” according to The Washington Post’s Daniel), or about
As far as I'm concerned, that's what I'm going to think of Super Mario from now on.
“It’s a little bit like watching a reality show where you get something new every night,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment, creator of “Wallets.” Trump’s show keeps changing characters, and new twists and turns come every day (he goes to N.F.L., Kim Jong-un begins to praise him).
If you miss one part, you'll miss it immediately.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was a nice 26 degrees sunny day in Kauai, but he was still sitting in his house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn’t get away from television as Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing at the Senate Judiciary Committee began, where the future of the Supreme Court itself was at stake.
“I remember when we were making those crazy shows, a lot of people said it was the beginning of the end for Western civilization,” Fleiss said.
“I thought they were joking, but they were right.”

Both parties are pouring money into the toughest races of the midterm congressional election
It comes as no surprise to anyone that in Pennsylvania’s 17th constituency, both parties are spending money uncounted after two active members of Congress have redrawn their seats to fight for the same seat.
One of the contenders for the recently redrawn Pittsburgh suburb is Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a seat in a by-election last spring.
Lamb's opponent, Republican Keith Rothfus, is now a representative of Pennsylvania's former District 12 constituency, which shows a significant overlap with what is now District 17.
The map had to be redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former district boundaries had been manipulated to the advantage of Republicans.
In the fight for the 17th district, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) were bidding on each other during the campaign.
Lamb's name came to be known in Pennsylvania after a close race to win the March by-election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
For more than a decade, Republicans held the seat, with Donald Trump winning the district by a 20-point margin.
According to political experts, Democrats have a slightly better chance of winning.
The U.S. is considering sanctions against El Salvador for supporting China, and has withdrawn from the plan.
According to diplomats, the Dominican Republic and Panama have already sided with Beijing, to which Washington has barely responded.
In June 2017, Donald Trump met with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and had a hotel in Panama until his partners pushed the Trump Organization’s leadership team out.
The State Department has recalled senior staff from U.S. missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of a “recent decision not to support Taiwan,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.
However, sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in U.S. aid, including to fight drugs, for development, and as economic aid.
The proposed punitive measures, such as the reduction of financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have had a painful impact on the Central American country, where unemployment and murder rates are also extremely high.
As private meetings continued, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic issues, which would have been a continuation of a similar meeting last year, with the primary goal of reducing migration to the United States.
In mid-September, high-level representatives of the administration made it clear that they wanted to hold the conference, which clearly indicated that they did not want to punish El Salvador.
It was announced that Vice President Mike Pence will be speaking at the conference scheduled for mid-October, which the diplomats say is a clear indication of how important the administration considers the event to be.
The three American delegates quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, and Washington did not issue any statements of condemnation or take any punitive measures.
A White House spokesman, John Bolton, declined to comment on the details of the dispute, which was reported anonymously by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats.
Their reports were backed up by external analysts close to the administration, who were also willing to speak only anonymously.
Historical Experiences
The next blow could be a report by special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating whether Trump obstructed justice in some way... and a number of published facts point to this.
Mueller’s investigation is also said to cover whether Trump’s team cooperated with Russia in trying to influence the election.
If the Democrats get a majority in Congress, they will surely try to hold Trump accountable, who may have to face the verdict of his fellow politicians after the voters.
We can see that there are a lot of uncertain issues, and Trump’s downfall is far from inevitable... and neither are his European friends.
Serious decisions have to be made on both sides of the Atlantic, depending on how long the fight lasts.
In 1938, several German officers were ready to put down Hitler, only waiting for the West to side with the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
There was no support, so the bloodshed of the next few years could not be prevented.
At historical turning points such as these, it is decided that the inevitable development of democracy will accelerate or slow down.
In today's America, we can identify several such turning points.
What will we do if Trump replaces Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein’s chair has been swaying since last year when, as our newspaper reported, he suggested that conversations with the president be recorded and he suggested that Trump was unfit for office.
Rosenstein said The Times had inaccurately reported the incident.
“How will we react if the F.B.I. investigation against Brett Kavanaugh is biased or incomplete and, despite a seemingly credible sexual harassment allegation, is appointed to the Supreme Court?
And the most important question: in the by-election, are we going to vote for a Congress that is ready to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will face a long winter.
I don’t think that will be the case, especially because of my experience in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, the same regime that once resided in the ambassadorial home.
My mother survived the Holocaust, emigrated to America, and 60 years later asked me to light candles on a swastika-marked table during the Sabbath.
With such a cultural heritage, how can I be pessimistic about our future?”

Rangers' Graham Dorrans confident ahead of Rapid Wien
The Rangers will welcome the Rapid Wien on Thursday. The victory against the Austrians after the unexpected draw against the Spanish Villarreal can ensure their participation in the Europa League Group G.
Midfielder Graham Dorrans' knee injury prevented him from playing until the season's 2–2 win over Villarreal, but he feels the Rangers can build on this to set more ambitious goals for themselves.
“It was an important point against a great team, Villarreal,” the 31-year-old said.
“We believed we could get a point and we got a point.
Maybe we could have scored another goal in the end, but we can’t complain about the draw either.
They were better in the first half and we were better in the second half.
Thursday will be another big game.
I hope we get the three points, but it won’t be easy because they were good enough in their last game, but with our fans behind us, we will definitely have the strength to win.
Last year was quite difficult, I was injured, there were a lot of changes around the club, but now the mood is very optimistic.
Our team is good, the guys are enjoying the game, the trainings are going well.
I hope that if we give it our all, we can put the previous season behind us and achieve good results.”
Many women worry about not saving enough for their old age
The participants in the survey had a clear idea of what kind of care they wanted for the elderly, but only a minority of them talked to their family members about it.
According to a survey by Nationwide, only half of the respondents discussed the expected costs of their elderly care with their spouse.
Only 10% said they talked to their children about it.
“Everyone wants a family member to take care of them, but they don’t usually raise the issue,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
The following are worth doing.
Discuss the issue with your spouse and children first: You can’t expect them to take care of you properly if you don’t tell them in time what your needs are.
Choose together with your advisor and family where and what kind of care you want; these decisions will have a significant impact on your subsequent costs.
Involve a financial advisor: he can give you useful ideas on how to pay for the planned care.
Financing can be with a traditional old-age benefit insurance policy or a hybrid savings combined life insurance policy that can cover expenses or use your own assets as collateral...if you have enough funds to do so.
Prepare the legal documentation: This will cut off the possibility of litigation in the future.
Assign a representative, a trusted person, who acts on your behalf in health matters, supervises your medical care, and makes sure that everything happens according to your expectations, even if you are unable to communicate.
Trust someone to manage your finances.
This trusted person will make the necessary financial decisions and take care of paying your bills when you are unable to do so.
Don’t forget the little details either: Let’s say your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about your medications and allergies?
These data must be recorded in writing so that they are available at any time.
“It’s not just the financial issues that need to be clarified, it doesn’t matter who your doctor is,” Martin said.
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
Everything has to be planned in advance.”
A man was shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a BB gun on his way home after a night out.
The victim, who was in his forties, was attacked in Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, with gunshot wounds to the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police described the shooting as a “random act” at around 2:30 a.m. local time.
Victim didn't see his assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a massive earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities.
The area's communications network was also damaged, so no news has been received from the Donggala Governorate, north of Palu, where the 7.5 magnitude earthquake was centered.
In Palu, more than 16,000 residents had to be evacuated.
Some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Celebes:
Palu was built at the end of a narrow cove on the west coast of the island of Celebes, the capital of the province of Central Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was struck by an earthquake and a tsunami.
Donggala Governorate is more than 300 km long on the northwestern coast of the island of Celebes.
The population of the province – a smaller administrative region than the province – was about 299,200 in 2017.
Central Celebes is dominated by fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of Donggala.
Nickel mining is an important sector of the economy, but it is concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the other side of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, Palut and Donggala have been hit by a series of tsunamis over the past 100 years.
A 1938 tsunami killed more than 200 residents and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami hit West Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the geologically active Pacific Ring of Fire, so earthquakes are common.
Just a few of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a massive sea storm began off the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra, triggering a tsunami that reached 14 countries, killing a total of 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, with more than half of the victims killed in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong quakes hit the west coast of Sumatra between late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, near Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 quake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's largest island, and the resulting tsunami claimed almost 700 lives on the southern coast.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 quake struck an island in the Mentawai Archipelago near Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter-tall tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A near-surface quake hits Aceh Pidie Jaya's governorship, causing panic and destruction in the wake of the devastating 2004 tsunami.
The tsunami did not happen this time, but more than 100 people died under the collapsed buildings.
2018: Lombok is a popular tourist island in Indonesia; a massive quake here claimed 500 lives, mostly in the northern part of the island.
Thousands of buildings have been leveled and thousands of tourists have been stranded on the island for a while.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, lives in Wasilla, Alaska, and is suspected of having committed domestic violence, obstructed reporting of domestic violence, and resisted arrest, state police said.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, she took the woman’s phone.
Palin is being held in pre-trial detention at Mat-Su Prison, with a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday and answered that he was “not guilty at all.”
Palin is charged with three Class A offences, punishable by up to four years in prison and a fine of $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offense, which could result in one-day incarceration and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's been in trouble with the law.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, reported the alleged attack to police.
The case is currently being heard by the Alaska Veterans Tribunal.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence and obstruction of reporting of the crime, as well as possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol in connection with the case.
At the time, his girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by several veterans’ organizations in 2016 when she attributed her son’s behavior to post-traumatic stress in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, hundreds of victims
At least 384 people were killed in Friday’s earthquake on the Indonesian island of Celebes.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Systems responsible for power and telecommunications have become inoperable, and the death toll is likely to rise in the next few days.
The centre of the earthquake was near central Celebes, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are a number of videos on social media about the arrival of the tsunami.
Hundreds of people gathered at a ceremony on the beach in Palu when the tsunami hit.

New York State prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York City terror attack that claimed eight lives. The state has not executed anyone since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov was charged in October with driving a rented truck from Home Depot on a bike path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, running over a number of pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight of his victims and “intentionally” injured them, according to a statement from the Southern District Prosecutor’s Office.
According to the submitted document, proof of either of the two charges may justify the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was charged with 22 crimes, including eight counts of extortion, which had been used almost exclusively against organized crime, and damaging and destroying motorized vehicles.
The attack “required significant planning and premeditated intent,” prosecutors said, and said Shaipov carried out the attack in a “terrible, cruel, inhumane” manner.
“Sayfullo Habibullavic Saipov has caused pain and loss to the families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” the petition reads.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York has been seeking the death penalty for a defendant for over a decade.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
In 1953, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were sentenced to death for spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
During the interrogations, he claimed that he was pleased with what he had done.
Saipov said ISIS videos on his phone gave him the idea to attack, according to the indictment.
Police say he asked for an ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, a public defender for Saipov, said he was "reasonably disappointed" by the prosecutors' decision.
“In our opinion, the actual life sentence for confessing would have been more favorable, and the death penalty would only prolong the suffering of all those involved in the case,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense attorneys had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty for their defendants.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should lead Brexit talks
Nigel Farage said during a demonstration at the Tory Conference that he was "calling on the people's army to fight".
The former leader of UKIP said politicians should feel the pressure from Eurosceptics after a member of Theresa May’s party suggested that Farage should be entrusted with negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone, who has not held any office, told attendees of the Birmingham meeting that the UK “would have left long ago” if Farage had been Brexit minister.
The fact that Torys, who are in favour of staying, have spoken at another anti-Brexit demonstration in the city is a good description of the pressure on May.
May is trying to implement the Chequers plan, which requires a constant wave of pro-Brexit, pro-stay and pro-EU cooperation.
According to his allies, despite negative reactions, he is trying to reach an agreement with Brussels so that the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party can choose only from his package or “total chaos”.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave protest in Solihull that the "Chequers alku" must be eliminated.
He suggested that Farage should be placed in the House of Lords and entrusted with negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were in charge of the negotiations, we would have already left,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I stand for Brexit, but the Chequers deal has to be put down.”
Criticizing the EU, he said: “We didn’t fight in world wars to be slaves of others.
We want to make our own laws.”
Bone rejected the assumption that public sentiment had changed since the 2016 vote: “There is no reality that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay.”
Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns also attended the meeting and told reporters: “All I ask is: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the voice of the people.
The Chequers deal is rejected by the public, the opposition will not vote, party membership is unpopular, and especially among the activists who work in the field and help us get into government.
Forget about the Chequers deal, and listen to us."
In a stern message to May, he added: “Only the Prime Minister who keeps his word can keep his seat.”
Farage said politicians need to “feel the pressure” not to dare to betray the results of the 2016 referendum.
“Trust between us, that is, between the people and our politicians, is at stake now”, he declared.
“They want to betray Brexit, and we are gathered here today to say that we will not let them do that.”
He said: “I want our politicians, who are about to betray Brexit, to feel the pressure.
“We will challenge the people’s army to win Brexit and we will not rest until we make the UK an independent, independent, proud country again.”
Meanwhile, pro-stayers marched in Birmingham and held a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists waved the flag of the “Toryk against Brexit” movement formed over the weekend.
Labour’s Lord Adonis was mocking the Conservatives over the party’s security flaws at the opening of the conference.
“These people said they had the IT background for a Canada-plus-plus agreement, seamless border crossing, and a borderless free trade agreement with Ireland,” he added.
- They're just blabbing.
“There is no good Brexit,” he said.
Warren ‘carefully considering’ running for presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would consider running for president after the November election.
According to the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future on Saturday at a public forum in West Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of Donald Trump, is preparing for a re-election in November against the state’s Republican representative, Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
There has been speculation for some time that he may be the one to replace Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event was Holyoke’s 36th Citizens’ Forum meeting with voters since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he was planning to run in the presidential election.
Warren said the time had come for “women in Washington to take part in the recovery of misguided government, including the assumption of supreme authority.”
Suspect in shooting of Sims playing in LSU arrested
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday said they had arrested a suspect in the shooting of basketball player Wayde Sims at the LSU on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.
They had previously posted a video of Friday’s shooting and asked for help identifying the man on the tape.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims suffered a head injury from the shot, which turned out to be fatal,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson confessed to being on the scene, carrying a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident at the East Baton Rouge District Police Department.
In Baton Rouge, the grown-up, nearly 2 meters tall, Sims played 32 games last season, 10 as a beginner, played an average of 17.4 minutes per game, scored 5.6 points and scored 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton moves closer to World Championship title after winning ahead of Sebastian Vettel thanks to team orders
After Valtteri Bottas qualified better than Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was immediately clear that the Mercedes team’s instructions would play a big role in the race.
Starting from pole position, Bottas made a good start and almost got Hamilton into trouble for defending his position in the first two laps, which allowed Vettel to attack his team-mate.
At first, Vettel stepped out into the pit lane and let Hamilton get stuck behind the midfield, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes took a turn behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a close action in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free after moving twice to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, celebrating his 21st birthday, started from the back row of the starting blocks and was seventh at the end of the first lap.
He then drove most of the race as he did not change tyres to quickly finish and overtake Kimi Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen in the hope of finishing fourth.
At the end of the race, he reached the pit lane on lap 44, but was unable to increase his pace on the remaining eight laps, so Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>ne took fourth place.
“It was a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he was told to let me go.
"The team has done an exceptional job of getting the top two places," Hamilton said.
His body language was very bad.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday for insisting that she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but merely noted that what was happening in the Senate proves that people are “scumbags, abominations, and liars.”
“What can happen, and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate in the last few days, is when you see the anger, when you see the people are angry, they are mean, they are hateful and they are liars,” he said.
“If you look at the statements and the leaks, they say, ‘Oh, that wasn’t me.
That wasn't me."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, you leaked?
Remember your answer... Did you leak the document? – “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't leak it."
Well, hold on a second.
No, we did not leak,” he added, imitating the senator.
Ford sent the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh to Feinstein in July, and the letter was leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the source of the leak was his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims and I didn’t leak his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“He asked me to treat him confidentially and I have treated him confidentially in accordance with his request.”
However, his denial does not seem to have been accepted by the president, who remarked at the Saturday evening meeting: “I’ll tell you what: his body language was very bad.
He may not have leaked it, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The president continued to defend the nominee to the Supreme Court, accused of sexual harassment by three women, claiming that Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You can see the obscenity, the obscenity, they don’t care who they’re hurting, who they’re going to have to go through to get power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars–Belfast Giants 5:3
Giants player Patrick Dwyer scores two goals against Dundee
With a 5:3 win in the rematch at Dundee on Saturday, the Dundee Stars atone for their defeat against the Belfast Giants in the Elite League match on Friday.
With the help of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier, the Giants had an early two-goal lead.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized the home team, and Dwyer restored the Giants' leadership.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard equalised for Dundee and Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured the win.
It was Adam Keefe's third Elite League defeat of the season, beating Dundee 2:1 in Belfast on Friday night.
The two sides met for the fourth time in the season, with the Giants winning the last three games.
Dwyer's opening goal in the fourth minute, 3:35 p.m., was scored by Kendall McFaull, and four minutes later, with David Rutherford's help, Beauvillier doubled their advantage.
In the revolving opening third, Sullivan brought the home side back into the game at 1:10 p.m., before Matt Marquardt’s pass to Cownie equalized at 3:16 p.m.
Dwyer made sure the Giants were able to take the lead on the break when he scored his second goal at the end of the first third of the night.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard again equalized with a man-on-man goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran's interplay helped Nielsen take the lead for Dundee towards the end of the second-third for the first time in the game, then secured the win with his team's fifth goal in the middle of the final third.
The Giants, who lost four of their last five games, returned to Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Killed to Save Hundreds on Plane from Earthquake
A hero in Indonesia celebrates an air traffic controller who lost his life while making sure a plane carrying hundreds of people could take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many more have gone missing after a major earthquake that caused a tsunami on the island of Celebes on Friday.
Strong aftershocks continue to be felt in the area, and many are trapped under the rubble in the city of Palu.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palua.
He stayed there so that Batik Air's flight 6321, which was already on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought he was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia’s ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We were heartbroken when we heard the news,” he said.
Authorities fear the death toll could be in the thousands, with the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong difficult to reach, according to the country’s emergency response agency.
“The number of victims is expected to continue to increase as many are trapped under the rubble and many have not been reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the organization.
The waves, which reached a height of six meters, destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral is held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Ambulances are bringing more bodies every minute.
There is little clean water.
Shops were looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is racing against time to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It's already a real tragedy, but it could be a lot worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and asked the country’s soldiers: “I ask all of you to work around the clock on evacuation-related tasks!
Are you ready?" CNN.
Indonesia has been hit by earthquakes this year on the island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says one person missing in lagoon plane crash
The airline, which operated the plane that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, said one person was missing, although it had previously claimed that all 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated from the plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that it was unable to account for a male passenger on Sunday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to additional information about the passenger, such as age and nationality questions.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into water while landing at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all of them in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact course of events are not yet clear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon in front of the runway.
Some witnesses say the plane missed the runway.
An American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was flying very low.
“That’s a good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to wade into the sinking plane's emergency exits in force water to the waist.
He said the flight attendants panicked and shouted, and he suffered minor head injuries.
According to the U.S. Navy, sailors who were repairing a quay nearby also helped rescue people and carried them ashore in an inflatable boat before the plane sank 30 metres below the surface.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but none of them affected Air Niugini.
Analyst compiled the events of the night when a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors on Saturday presented the case to the prosecutor at the retrial of the man, who is accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an information analysis expert.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to piece together the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of the woman’s death.
Rowlett said she received location data from several phones that showed she was with Tellis Chambers on the night of her death, contradicting the man's earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his phone was near Chambers when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police questioned Sanford.
Sanford gave his testimony on Saturday, saying he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that Tellis was "lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another controversy was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks ago at the time of her death.
Cell phone records show they've only known each other a week.
Rowlett reported that after Chambers’ death, Tellis deleted her text messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be presented to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip-Hop?
A hip-hop trio challenged the negative attitude surrounding the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
According to The High Breed of Bristol, hip-hop has moved away from its roots in political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to those roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common are once again popular in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Is it a black one again?
New York Dada Sues Couple for Dismissal After ‘Racist’ Message
A New York nurse filed a lawsuit against a couple for being fired for discrimination after the mother complained in a wrong message that they had “used another black” nanny.
The couple denied being racists and compared the lawsuit to “blackmail.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she saw the woman was black on her first day of work when new child care provider Giselle Maurice arrived in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
However, instead of her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman, feeling “unpleasant,” dismissed Ms. Maurice, claiming that the outgoing nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and was expecting a Filipino instead.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day’s work and sent home with an Uber.
Maurice is now suing the party for reparation for the dismissal and is asking for $350 a day in compensation for the six-month period of residential work for which he was originally hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them to stop, this can’t be done,” he told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to accusations of racism, saying the termination of Maurice’s employment was reasonable because they feared they could not trust him once he had been violated.
“My wife sent him something he didn’t mean.
It's not racist.
We are not racists,” husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you entrust your children to someone with whom, even if by accident, you were rude?
Your newborn?
Oh, come on!"
Plasco, who compared the lawsuit to “blackmail,” said his wife had just given birth to the baby two months ago and was “in a very difficult situation.”
Would you attack someone like that?
It’s not a very nice thing to do,” added the investment banker.
While the legal process is underway, a court of public opinion has already quickly condemned the party on social media, denouncing their behavior and logic.
According to a letter just found, the publisher of Paddington was afraid that readers would not be able to relate to a talking bear.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put ourselves in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It’s quite amusing to have this information now that we know what a huge success Paddington is.”
He said his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write a children’s book about a teddy bear, would not have been angry if his work had been rejected, adding that the book’s 60th anniversary was bittersweet after his father’s death last year.
He described Paddington as “a very important member of their family” and added that his father was “very proud” of his final success.
“He was a very quiet man, he wasn’t arrogant at all,” she said.
“But because Paddington was almost real to him, he was like a kid who’s got something going for him: we’re proud of him, even if it’s not really our doing.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although he created it and it sprang from his imagination, he always attributed the success to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
Upon landing, she and her daughter rushed to Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought for her life in vain.
“Nad called me regularly to tell me that he was in a very bad condition and that they didn’t expect him to survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nad saying that my daughter was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
I said goodbye.
I said, “Tashi, I love you very much, darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors gave him to keep his heart beating slowly ran out and then left his system.
He had died before, and then everything stopped.
All I had to do was sit there and wait, knowing it was all over.
I couldn’t cry or scream or cry because I was in a place where I was surrounded by families and people.
I couldn't leave myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane, along with the others who ignored the ordeal she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” he said.
“I bowed my head and my tears were falling all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew he loved my daughter very much.”
Postcards with bereaved women to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from throwing their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put up postcards full of inspirational messages and emergency numbers on a bridge in Wales.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he became depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any of my parents to feel the same way I do every day,” she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook, and her smile stuck to everyone.
He knew everyone’s smile.
“I’ve always been told that a smile can brighten up any room.”
But he gave up his job before he died because he was in “very bad shape.”
Tyler, who ended his life with his own hands, was found by his then 11-year-old brother.
Ms. Davis said, “I was constantly worried that this was going to have some kind of domino effect.”
Ms. David created the postcards “to let people know that there are people who can be contacted and talked to, even if it’s just a friend.
“Don’t sit still, you have to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, who had lost Ms. Davies’s friend Mark, who had been her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he was depressed or depressed or anything,” she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
“He was totally out of his mind on Christmas Day: when the kids opened their presents, he didn’t look them in the eye or anything like that.”
He said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they had to deal with it: “He left a huge void in the family.
It broke our hearts into small pieces.
But we have to keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future as FBI begins investigation
“I thought if we could get what he asked for — a limited-time, limited-scale investigation — we might be able to come to an agreement,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that the committee was afraid of “falling to pieces” because of the party’s indecision.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters oppose the FBI investigation?
Their resistance is solely due to timing.
The by-election is only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans are not expected to do well, it will be much harder for them to get their man into the highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators and lobby for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House, and through him he also met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
There are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats in the Senate.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will receive the minimum 50 votes in the Senate that would allow Vice President Mike Pence to make the decision to impeach Mr. Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of defectors 'decreased' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors en route to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Bjengsok quoted the Southern Unification Ministry as saying there had been 1,127 dissidents in the past year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher penalties for human traffickers were the main reasons.
Pyongyang has not publicly commented on this information.
Most of the North Korean defectors will eventually be granted South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing to China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China welcomes dissidents as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often forcibly returns them.
The relationship between the North and South, which are still practically at war, has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang to discuss stalled nuclear disarmament talks.
This came at a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they agreed on broad lines for further cooperation on the nuclear-weapon-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of trust in Americans, there is no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances, it is unthinkable that we should unilaterally disarm,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is 'hysterical' and 'inappropriate' for the Supreme Court
House Minority Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said his behavior was inappropriate for working on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said in an interview at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
“I also thought involuntarily that if a woman behaved in this way at any time, she would be called ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said, explaining his reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh protested emotionally against allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as a teenager.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost yelling and even losing his voice when he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the committee’s Democrats, calling the charges against him a “grotesque and coordinated character assassination” organized by angry liberals over Hillary Clinton’s defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh’s behavior had proven he was unfit to work for the Supreme Court because he was biased against Democrats.
“I think he’s locked himself out with the statements and the behavior that he’s made against the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if he would try to hold Kavanaugh accountable if he filled the post and if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
“What I’m saying is if you’re not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, it’s not just for the Supreme Court, it’s not for the court you’re in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge in the Metropolitan Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he is concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions regarding the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade case, as Kavanugh is considered a conservative judge.
During Kavanaugh's hearings, he avoided questions about whether he would change the Supreme Court's rulings.
“This is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to become a member of the court and expect us to be happy,” Pelosi said.
And women need to be in control.
It's a legitimate outburst, a build-up of rage that's been building up for months and years, and you can't let it go without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s that rare, do you?”
“She told me that she was crying in anger, but she developed a technique according to which, when she started crying in anger, she said to her interlocutor: ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
But I'm angry."
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was a great idea."
In part, they dismiss tears as a sign of anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of an early job, an office dominated by men, where I once began to cry in angry helplessness when I was grabbed by an older woman – a cool manager I had always been afraid of – and led me out to the stairwell.
“Never let them see me cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’re happy because they’ve upset you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on her presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught with an extramarital affair on Monkey Business and dropped out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, in deep frustration, found that there was no reason not to run for the presidency herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the race and they wanted another candidate in the middle of their backs.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
As the campaign had been going on for a long time, Ms. Schroeder had fallen behind in raising the money, so she vowed not to enter the contest unless she collected the $2 million.
It was a battle doomed to defeat.
He found out that some of his supporters gave the men $1,000, but he only got $250.
“Did you think I would get a discount?” he thought.
When he held a press conference not to launch an official campaign, he was so overwhelmed with emotion over gratitude for the people who supported him, frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and reach voters directly, and anger over sexism, that he choked his throat.
“They thought I was having a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalled how the press reacted.
“They thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they were going to write on my tombstone?
“Crying?”
How can the US-China trade war be good for Beijing?
The opening fire of the trade war between the U.S. and China was almost deafening, and while the battle is far from over, experts say the country-to-country split could benefit Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warnings earlier this year by imposing a tax on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, as the new tariffs already affect $200 billion worth of products, effectively taxing half of the goods that go from China to the US.
Beijing has retaliated in every case, most recently by imposing tariffs of between 5 and 10 percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to strike back every time, and the world’s second-largest economy will certainly not back down in the near future.
If you want to get Washington to back down, that would mean that you have to give in to demands, but a public bow to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Chin-ping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays well, U.S. trade war pressure could benefit China in the long run by reducing dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick decision in either Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could send any of the two economies into an economic upheaval is far more serious than observers have previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, a research assistant at New American Security.
Syria ‘ready’ for return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding the country, which has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Moallem stated that the country is improving.
“The current situation is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists, restoring normality.
Now all the conditions are in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, who have had to flee between terrorism and arbitrary economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
An additional six million people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Moallem said the Syrian state would welcome any help to rebuild the country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. team 16.5:10.5 at Le Gold National outside Paris.
The U.S. has failed for the sixth time in a row in Europe, and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe defended its championship title, as Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn's team scored the 14.5 points necessary to defeat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, an American star player who struggled throughout the tournament, threw his shot into the water at the 16th hole of par-3, passing the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in every round, becoming one of only four players to have ever achieved a 5-0-0 result since the tournament in its current form began in 1979.
Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen, Denmark's lowest ranked European player.
One of the best players in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 to Ian Poulter, who may have been in his last Ryder Cup.
Eight veterans of the Ryder Cup, Spain's Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's all-time best European winner with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I couldn’t stop today.
It's been a rough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy that I got the cup back.
It’s all about the team and I’m happy to be able to help,” he said after Garcia’s emotional victory in Europe.
The baton is handed over to Jon Rahm, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods in a 2&1 singles match on Sunday.
“I feel incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this man,” Rahm, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 main titles and is preceded only by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played excellent golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said: “I’m proud of these guys because they fought.
There was a time this morning when we set fire to Europe.
We fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
Great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're regrouping our team, working with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to raise your hats too.
The opponent was better than us.”
