Members of the Welsh Parliament are afraid to look like fools
Some MPs are confused by the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The controversy arose out of a plan to change the name of the House of Representatives to the Welsh Parliament.
Regardless of party affiliations, the members of the Representative Council are concerned that the change may expose them to ridicule.
According to one Labour representative, the group is concerned that the name "rhymes with the words Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means fool and pwp means poop.
According to one member of the Plaid party, the majority of the group is "not satisfied" and has suggested other options.
A Conservative party spokesman said his group was "open-minded" about the name change, but noted that there is a short verbal leap from the word "MWP" to the word "stupid."
In Welsh, the letter ‘w’ is pronounced in the same way as the English letter ‘u’ in Yorkshire.
The Representative Council Commission, which is currently preparing the legislative amendment needed for the name change, said as follows: "The final decision on the titles describing the members of the Representative Council is, of course, up to the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gives the Council the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published an opinion poll on the proposals, showing broad support for the nomination of the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
While the Commission preferred the MPs of Wales or the acronym WMP for the Council of Representatives, the MWP option received the most support in a public opinion poll.
The members of the Representative Council are apparently proposing alternative titles, but the lack of consensus may be a headache for Chairman Elin Jones, who is expected to table a bill within a few weeks.
The legislation on amendments also contains other amendments concerning the activities of the Representative Council, such as rules on the loss of a seat and the form of the committee system.
In the legislative debate, the members of the Council can cast their final vote on the title under which they should be called.
Macedonians go to the polls in a referendum on changing the country’s name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the name of the country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum aims to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long repeated that the name of its northern neighbour is essentially a territorial claim on its territory and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO membership aspirations.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will ignore the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price paid for membership of the EU and NATO.
St. Martins bells go quiet as Harlem churches go through tough times
"The elderly people I've talked to say there used to be a bar or church on every street corner," says Adams.
"There are none these days."
He said the loss of the bars was understandable.
He said, "People's relationships have changed."
“Bars are no longer the common living rooms of the neighborhood where people gather regularly.”
In the case of churches, he is concerned that the sale of property will not carry as far as leaders imagine, "and sooner or later they will have returned to square one."
He added that churches can be replaced by residential houses and apartments that are not inhabited by people who would support the remaining sanctuaries in the neighborhood.
“The absolute majority of people who buy houses in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and thus they will hasten the day when these churches will close their doors once and for all, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white parishes before Harlem became a black settlement – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins a decade later.
The original white Methodist church moved out in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation acquired the building.
The St. Martins was taken over by a black congregation led by Pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the merchants of 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, against their opposition to the hiring or promotion of blacks.
When Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild the church, they adopted a tower clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson at St. Martins, proudly called the tower clock game “the watches of the poor.”
The expert who played the tower clock game in July called it by another name: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world’s first tower clock game played by a black musician. It was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to play a larger tower clock game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martins didn't replace him.
In recent months, St. Martins has developed a complex skein, involving both lay leaders of the Church and architects and contractors hired by the Episcopal Diocese.
The sacstas — a governing body made up of lay church leaders — wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would "seek to pass the cost" on to the sacstas, even though the sacstas had not been involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency in the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old lobster diver in California
Authorities say the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and harmed him while he was diving for lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack took place at Beacon's Beach, Encinitas, just before 7:00 a.m.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, and he and a group of others paddled to the boy to help him out of the water.
Hammel said he thought the boy was just excited to catch a lobster, but then realized he was shouting, "I was bitten!"
I was bitten!'
When he got to the boy, Hammel said he noticed that his entire collarbone had been torn open.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: there's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where he is said to be in critical condition.
The species of shark attacked is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but was found to be a harmless species.
Giles added serious injuries to the victim's upper torso.
The authorities closed the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and safety reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty industry
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style beauty departments served by expert advisors.
This is a major move for the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty industry, which continues to grow despite declining fashion and home goods sales. Larger beauty departments will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and if successful will be expanded to other stores next year.
Beauty products are invested because supermarkets sought to fill the shelf space previously reserved for televisions, microwave ovens and household goods.
Sainsbury’s says its beauty portfolio will double to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also gain more space, and they will have their own brand-specific areas similar to Boots stores.
In the future, the majority of products will be vegan-friendly, as young shoppers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will try out rental stores in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Internet shopping and the shift from grocery shopping to small, one-time purchases in local stores force supermarkets to invent new enticements for customers.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe has said that stores will look more like department stores as the supermarket chain struggles against discount stores like Aldi and Lidl by adding services and non-food items.
Since purchasing both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores, as well as Habitat stores, which the company says has promoted food sales and made the purchases profitable.
The supermarket failed in its previous attempt to reform its beauty and pharmacy departments.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended in a dispute over how to share the profits of pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy follows the acquisition of Sainsbury's, which sold 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
The company said Lloyds was part of a plan to expand its range of luxury skincare products to four stores under brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer at Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve changed the look and feel of our beauty departments to improve the customer experience.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who are ready to advise customers.
Our range of brands meets all needs and our attractive surroundings and convenient locations make us a compelling beauty shopping destination that challenges the traditional way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'excited' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left “in a rage” after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn’t have time for their brand of home accessories and accessories, Truly.
The two companies have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute. She now plans to focus on her new giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "excited" at a tense meeting last Tuesday at Jones's corporate empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinhamshire. The TV star had admitted that her new <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million contract wouldn't leave enough time for their homeware and accessories brand, Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from the UK to one of his holiday homes.
According to one source, “Truly was by far Holly’s most important project.
It was his long-term plan to ensure his livelihood for the next two decades.
His decision has left everyone in awe.
No one could believe Tuesday’s events so close to publication.
Marlow has a warehouse full of products waiting to be sold."
The This Morning host is one of Britain’s most lucrative stars, and experts say his departure could cost the company millions in product investment, from pillows to candles to clothing to household items, not to mention the delay in the release.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and his wife, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for about ten years.
Willoughby organized Cap for Truly in 2016, and Jones, 52, took over as chairman in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby will be the new M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV’s I’m A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said the night before, "We don't comment on his business."
Hard talk and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism in the media of what some would consider inappropriate for the president and his positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said he was pretending to be the “news anchor” voice.
“I didn’t give up at all.”
Kim is keen to meet again after Trump hailed the first meeting in July as a significant step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
However, nuclear negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in July, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see a “similar reaction” from the United States to North Korea’s early disarmament efforts.
Instead, he said, the United States would continue to impose sanctions designed to keep up the pressure.
Trump had a much more optimistic view.
"North Korea is doing very well," he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We now have such an excellent relationship.”
He said efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: missile tests had been halted, hostages had been helped to freedom and the remains of American soldiers had been returned home.
He also defended his unusual style when talking about his relationships with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 more people trying to get into this crowded hall outside, we’d have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said.
Indonesian Tsunami and Earthquake Destroyed Island, Hundreds Killed
For example, in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, several foreign voluntary organizations were told that they were not needed.
The national emergency required by international aid was not declared, even though around 10% of the Lombok population had been left homeless.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so the situation is a bit challenging," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is a returning group, it is not certain that foreign staff can work in the field.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said the Indonesian authorities would assess the situation to see if international organisations are allowed to participate in the relief effort.
Indonesia remains woefully unprepared to face the forces of nature, given the regular occurrence of earthquakes.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
It was likely that lives were lost in the fire because of the missing tsunami warning siren, even though the warning was still in effect.
Traveling between the numerous islands of Indonesia is challenging even in the best of conditions.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship assigned to Lombok to help the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Return, but it will take at least three days to reach the new accident area.
President Joko Widodo made the development of Indonesia's worn-out infrastructure the focus of his election campaign, and he has been funneling money to improve roads and railways.
However, some governments are facing a funding gap as new elections approach next year.
Tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of religion, also add to the pressure.
Christians and Muslim gangs have fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons, resulting in the deaths of more than 1,000 people and the displacement of tens of thousands of people.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge sinks a late handicap against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the Premier League on Saturday after scoring 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqir 27 yards from Chelsea's goal after his team was in a loss.
He moved the ball to the left before scooping a shot at the back post.
The shot hovered high over the penalty area towards the upper right corner.
Finally, the ball dropped over Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to make myself play to get the ball and players like Shaq are always playing up as much as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time for myself as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, I took one touch and fired without thinking too much."
Chelsea led the match 1–0 after Belgium’s Eden Hazard scored 25 minutes into the game.
The Blues gave Mateo Kovacic a heel pass before running away near the midfield and sprinting to the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a quick wall pass in the midfield.
Then he released Hazard into the penalty area with a spectacular pass.
Hazard ran away from the defence and passed Liverpool's Alisson Becker with a left foot shot in the back corner.
Liverpool will face the Champions League group stage in Naples on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Death toll from Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
Indonesia's disaster agency said early Sunday that the number of people killed in the earthquake and tsunami had risen to 832.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo told a press conference that many had been trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings when a 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck on Friday, raising waves as high as six meters.
Fragments of the collapsed buildings spread widely to the city of Pau, with a population of 380,000.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after finding woman stabbed to death
The body of a woman found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, triggered a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking people in the area to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Superintendent Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its infancy, but I appeal to anyone in Birkenhead near John Street to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also call on all taxi drivers, especially those who may have recorded something on the dashboard video, to contact the police, who may have vital information for the investigation."
A female police spokesman has confirmed that the woman who was found dead is from Birkenhead and that the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, people who may have known the woman have come to the scene of the crime and asked where she was found.
As the investigation continues, the police say they will try to inform the victim’s family about the incident.
A taxi driver from Grayson Mews had just tried to get back to his apartment, but police said no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
Residents have just learned that it can take hours before they are allowed back in.
One officer was heard telling the man that the entire area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A tearful woman appeared at the scene.
He repeated, “It’s terrible.”
At 2 p.m. there were two maijas in the isolated area, and a third outside.
In the isolated area, there were several police officers who were monitoring the apartment building.
Anyone who knows anything is invited to send an email to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 using code 247 on September 30.
Parliament's Cromwell statue becomes part of history's rewrite
The eviction of the statue would be poetic justice, considering that his own fanatical Puritan supporters destroyed cultural and religious memorabilia in England like the best of the Taliban.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "stupid" and "rewriting history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the ongoing debate to remove the statues would make the target of Oliver Cromwell’s statue in front of the Palace of Westminster.
Cromwell neither commanded nor carried out the iconoclasm of the English Civil War.
The false Cromwell might have to suffer for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas, who lived in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent portrayal of Cromwell reflects 19th-century opinion and is historical evidence of a character that many still regard as worthy of praise.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, though perhaps more so in the 19th century than today, see Cromwell as a defender of parliament against external pressure, which in this case was of course brought on by the monarchy.
Whether this is an accurate description of the subject is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain, at least, is that the dispute of the mid-17th century has shaped the later development of our nation, while Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing the other side of that division.
Moreover, his achievements as regent deserve praise and remembrance."
Chinese farmer killed by killer pig
Local media report that a pig attacked a farmer and killed him in a market in southwestern China.
Only the body of a man identified by his last name "Yuan" was found near a pigsty in Liupanshui Market in Guizhou Province. The man's artery had been severed and he was covered in blood, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig herder is preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He traveled with his cousin from nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also found the door to a nearby piggy farm open.
In the pig, he said he saw a large boar whose mouth was covered in blood.
According to the news, a forensic investigation confirmed the death of a farmer who had been mutilated by a 250-kg boar.
The Guiyang Evening News reported that a cousin named “Wu” said that “my cousin’s legs were bloody and bruised.”
The CCTV footage shows the cousin arriving at the market to feed the pigs on Thursday morning at 4:40 a.m.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market leaders told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so as not to harm others as police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and Tori officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for the death.
Pigs have been known to attack humans in the past, although this is rare.
In 2016, a woman and her husband were attacked by a pig on a Massachusetts farm.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing nearly 200 pounds (300 kg) snagged a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife was able to run the animal away.
An Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012. After the incident, a farmer living in Manitoba told CBC News that while pigs aren’t usually aggressive, the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
"They're just playful.
They're like little children, very curious, and they're not meant to hurt.
You just have to respect them properly,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains bring heavy rains to the south-west of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken as it moves over the cooler waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring flooding rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Rosa’s wind speed was 38 meters per second, or a first-class hurricane, at 5 a.m. east coast time on Sunday, and it was located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
When Rosa arrives on the California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push deep tropical moisture northwards towards the south-west coast of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
After that, the tropical humidity interacting with the approaching low pressure will form large areas of precipitation to the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, rainfall of between 25 and 100 millimetres causes dangerous torrential rains and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes precipitation of 50 to 75 millimeters per hour in certain fallout areas, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
Some areas in the southwest, especially Arizona, are expected to receive up to 50-100 millimeters of rain.
Heavy rain floods are possible and conditions can deteriorate rapidly due to the fragmentation of tropical rain.
In case of tropical rain, it is strongly recommended to avoid going into the wilderness on foot.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into flowing rivers, and thunderstorms create local gusts of wind and flying dust.
An approaching low-pressure zone brings local heavy rains to the coastal areas of Southern California.
Precipitation of more than 10 mm is possible, causing small waste streams and slippery roads.
This would be the first rainy season in the region.
Scattered tropical showers begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, until rainfall expands during Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last all Wednesday.
In October, strong fluctuations in temperatures can be seen throughout the United States as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes causes large temperature fluctuations over short distances.
The central part of the United States is an excellent example of large temperature differences on Sunday.
There's a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, and Nebraska, St. Louis, and Iowa's Des Moines.
The lingering heat of summer tends to intensify and expand again in the next few days.
The beginning of October is widely expected to be warm in the central and eastern parts of the United States, with temperatures around +26 degrees Celsius from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York, temperatures could reach +26 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 4 degrees warmer than the average.
According to our long-term forecast, there is a good chance of higher-than-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing.
More than 20 million people watched six television shows on Tuesday, in which Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual misconduct in the 1980s, gave fascinating testimony.
At the same time, the political stalemate continued as television broadcasters suspended their broadcasts at the last minute, according to which the FBI will conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations based on a contract arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had grabbed him and tried to take off his clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, on the other hand, gave an emotional testimony in which he said he was 100% sure that this was not the case.
The number of viewers was likely higher than Nielsen’s 20.4 million on Friday.
The company averaged viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Figures from other broadcasters such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often has trouble measuring viewers who are watching in offices.
Something about the proportions says that the number corresponds to the number of spectators of the American football playoffs or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, had the largest audience of all television companies, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day hearing.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
After the hearing, interest was still high.
At the heart of Friday’s drama was Flake.
Cameras on CNN and CBS showed him in an elevator on his way to a hearing by the Justice Committee on Friday, a moderate Republican background group had previously said he would vote for Kavanaugh.
CNN showed live how he stood for minutes looking down as the scoldings flew.
"I'm standing right in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you believe he's telling the truth to the people?
“You have power when so many women are powerless,” she was told.
Flake said his office had issued a statement and added, before the elevator doors closed, that he had more to tell after the committee hearing.
Hours later, cable and broadcast networks broadcast live when the Justice Committee began voting to put Kavanaugh’s nomination to the vote in the Senate Plenary.
However, Flake said he would only act on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the candidate next week, as minority Democrats have demanded.
Flake was partially convinced by the conversations he had with his friend, Democrat Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and several other senators.
Flake's election had power because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May Accuses Critics of Brexit Policy
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of her EU exit plans of policies that threaten Britain’s future and national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at a Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
Next to May's interview, another interview was published on the front page of the newspaper, in which his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, continued his attack on May's so-called Chequers plan. Johnson calls the proposal that Britain and the EU levy each other's import duties "absurd".
The shooting of Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of the death of an LSU player
Police have arrested him on suspicion of shooting 20-year-old Wayde Sims, who played basketball at the LSU.
Twenty-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and taken to prison, and Baton Rouge police say he is charged with second-degree murder.
Authorities released a video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, in which police said Sims lost his glasses.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they contained Simpson’s DNA, according to the WAFB.
Police say Simpson admitted to shooting Wayde during questioning.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to the Advocate.
An East Baton Rouge County medical examiner released a preliminary report Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The agency thanks the Louisiana State Police task force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and residents of the area for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement officials for their "ingenuity and justice."
Sims was 20.
The two-meter-tall forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He recorded an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in the game last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning he was "appalled" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“You’re always afraid something like this is going to happen,” Wayde said.
Volcano spews ash over Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern residential areas of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the Disaster Prevention Center of Mexico urged citizens to stay away from the volcano as the crater’s activity accelerated and 183 gas and ash eruptions were registered over the course of the day.
The centre recorded noise and vibration several times.
Social media posted images of cars in residential areas such as Xochimilco in Mexico City, where the windshields of cars were covered with a thin layer of ash.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in the activity of a volcano 72 kilometers southwest of the capital since Mexico was shaken by a 7.1 magnitude earthquake in September 2017.
The Don Goyo volcano has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan separatists clash ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday in a clash between pro-independence protesters and riot police, with thousands taking part in the clashes on the first anniversary of a split vote.
The police detained a group of masked pro-independence activists who threw eggs and powder paint at the police, which formed dark clouds of dust in the normally tourist-filled streets.
As the day progressed, more skirmishes erupted as policemen used their batons to restrain the melees.
Clashes between the pro-independence and unionist groups continued for several hours, with the former shouting "no forgetting, no forgiveness" and the latter shouting "long live Spain".
The local press reports that 14 people have been treated for minor injuries sustained during the demonstrations.
Tensions are still brewing in the pro-independence region a year after the referendum of 1 October, which is declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters voted for independence by a clear majority, although participation was low when the opposition boycotted the vote.
Catalan authorities said nearly 1,000 people were injured in last year's violent clashes as police tried to stop polling at polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups spent the night outside Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
There was a demonstration, but it had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalonia's independence.
"Last year we had one of the best moments of our lives."
I saw my parents crying with joy when they were able to vote, but now we are stuck in place,” he says.
Despite the narrow but vital victory in last December’s regional elections, the momentum of Catalonia’s pro-independence parties has waned this year. Many of the most prominent leaders are in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting trial for their involvement in the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed a pro-police protest on her phone, says politicians on both sides of the dispute have stirred up controversy.
“The situation is getting worse all the time,” he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been detained since last year, announced that he would take part in next year's European elections.
“Becoming a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the erosion of democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crashed into house
The men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The event took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m. British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.
At some point, the car could be shot at.
Livingston beat Rangers 1-0 with Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal at Livingston
Livingston stunned the Rangers and caused Steven Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was finally enough to win as Gary Holt's team advanced to shared second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team missed the first away win of the season in the Premiership, and next Sunday they will face series leader Hearts, who is eight points ahead.
The Rangers will face Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, continued his undefeated streak in the series for six games, and Holt has not lost a single game since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston Loses Seats to Missing Visitor
Holt's team should have led long before their goal, having caused the Rangers a lot of trouble with their straightness.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finish was wide, and Alan Lithgow was able to slide onto Craig Halkett's butt-feed on the ground, but passed the ball.
The hosts willingly surrendered control of the ball to the Rangers because they knew they could vaccinate on special occasions.
This is how the important goal came about.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free-kick, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson played Menga a spot where he could move the ball to the middle of the penalty area and finish.
The Rangers had held the ball by then, but found the home team's defense to be holding, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely got a try.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to fight back.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor blocked Scott Pittman's attempt and Lithgow passed the ball in one of Livingston's special situations.
The centralizations raining down on Livingston's penalty area were constantly cleared away, and two situations were unnecessarily penalized - Glenn Middleton, a tackle by Halkett, and a ball in his hand.
"Wonderful performance from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and result from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and excelled every player, continuing the upswing through the season.
The way the team has played and the crew has not changed much since it has returned to the highest level of the league. However, Holt must be recognised for the way he has strengthened the team since he arrived.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding in leading an excellently organized defense, with Menga keeping Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the match.
The Rangers had no idea.
The team has occasionally performed really well under Gerrard, but now far below his standards.
The last pass was exhausted, and they managed to open the defense of the home team only once. This should serve as a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are the middle of the league table.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
The smile was tender and the sky blue on Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany to improve relations between NATO allies.
There have been disagreements about human rights and freedom of the press, as well as Turkey’s EU aspirations.
Erdogan continued his journey to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police prevented a crowd of 25,000 supporters from gathering in front of the mosque, justifying the matter for security reasons, but many supporters still flocked to see the president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators - many of them Kurdish - also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German Government's decision to invite him to the country.
Competing demonstrations reflect the division of opinion, with some German Turks hailing him as a hero while others taunting him as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at around 10 a.m. local time in the southwest of Deptford, near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, where there is heavy traffic.
The driver of the car stopped and the medical staff came to the victim’s aid, but the man died at the scene.
A few months earlier, another cyclist was killed in a traffic accident on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday’s crash site.
Police say they are trying to identify the man and inform his family.
There are roadblocks and bus traffic has been diverted, and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Injured in Riots
Prison officials say six prison guards were injured in the men's high-security riots in the prison.
The unrest began at HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, British time, and continues to this day.
Tornado special police officers have been brought in to calm the unrest, which is caused by eight prisoners in one prison wing.
Police officers’ minor facial injuries were treated at the scene.
A prison service spokesman said: “HMP Long Lartin prison has been sent with specially trained prison staff to take care of the situation.
Six staff members have received treatment for their injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be taken into police custody and may have to spend longer time behind bars.”
The HMP Long Lartin prison holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
He was hospitalized in June after being attacked by one of the inmates.
In addition, riot police were called to the prison in October because of serious unrest in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa brings the threat of heavy rainfall to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (drought zones can benefit)
Tropical low pressures rarely arrive in Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s happening early next week when Hurricane Rosa’s remains move across the southwest desert, with the risk of heavy rainfall.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of heavy rain on Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, as well as cities in Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to make her way directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving Monday in the form of rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted in its tweet that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or low-pressure state within 300 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane still within 65 kilometers of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall of 50-100 millimeters. On the Mogollin Ridge in Arizona, it can rain up to 150 millimeters in some places.
In other areas of the south-west desert, including the central rock mountains and Great Basin, 25-50 milliliters can be reliably obtained. In some places it can rain up to a total of 100 millimeters.
Rosa’s rains can also be a blessing in an area affected by drought if there is no risk of heavy rainfall.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some rainfall can be beneficial because of the severe drought in the south-west.
According to the U.S. Drought Bureau, more than 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second-highest category, according to weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa first makes landfall on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa is located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. At that time, it is still the strength of a hurricane with a wind speed of 135 kilometers per hour. It moves north at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour.
The storm loses strength as it encounters cooler waters in the Pacific.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico in the form of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts of Mexico, rainfall can be severe and pose a significant risk of flooding.
"From the California peninsula to the northwest of Sonora, 75 to 150 millimeters are expected, and up to 250 millimeters are possible," says weather.com.
Rosa then continues her journey through Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border as a tropical low pressure during Tuesday morning hours. From there, she continues her journey through Arizona to southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest risks to Rosa or its remains are likely to be associated with very heavy rainfall on the California Peninsula, northwest Sonora, and the U.S. Southwest Desert," the National Hurricane Bureau said in a statement.
These rainfalls are expected to cause life-threatening torrential rains and waste streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests in Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at 4am UK time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital, where he is said to be in a “stable” condition.
Police say they arrested one 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old man in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset during the night.
The police are asking for contact from anyone who may have video footage of the events recorded on a mobile phone.
Trump Says Kavanaugh Experienced ‘Evil and Anger’ from Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the unscrupulous and disgraceful methods of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered from the Democratic Party’s “wickedness and anger” throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the allegation of sexual harassment made by Christine Blasey Ford decades ago in their teens.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said Saturday that “the Americans saw Kavanaugh’s excellence, character and courage” that day.
"The vote in favor of confirming Judge Kavanaugh's appointment is a vote for one of the most distinguished jurists of our time, with excellent merits in public service," he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president implicitly referred to Kavanaugh’s appointment when he spoke of the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterms.
“We are five weeks away from the most important election of our lifetime.
“I’m not just campaigning, I’m campaigning,” he said.
"That's why I go everywhere to fight for excellent candidates."
Trump said the Democrats had taken on the task of “opposing and preventing.”
A senior aide to the Republican leadership told CNN that Kavanaugh’s first major nomination vote is expected in the Senate on Friday at the latest.
Hundreds killed in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, death toll expected to rise
Authorities said on Saturday at least 384 people were killed after a major earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, many of them wiped out by giant waves hitting the beaches.
Hundreds of people had gathered for the festival on the beach of the city on Friday, when waves up to six metres high hit the shore at dusk. Many washed up to their deaths as the waves destroyed everything in their path.
The tsunami was caused by an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude.
When the threat of the tsunami appeared yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run away immediately, leaving them as victims,” said Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster relief agency, BNPB, in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, tree trunks, houses, and struck everywhere on land," says Nugroho. He adds that the tsunami reached a speed of 800 kilometers per hour on the open sea before hitting the coast.
Some people survived the tsunami by climbing trees, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the Disaster Management Agency show several destroyed houses and shops, warped and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian agency for technology assessment and application, BPPT, issued a statement saying the energy released in Friday’s massive earthquake was equivalent to about 200 atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
It says that the terrain of a city at the end of a long, narrow bay may have inflated the tsunami.
Nugroho described the devastation as "broad" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found in the rubble of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the casualties and damage may be greater on the coast that runs 300 kilometers north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the quake's center.
The communications "are completely cut off and no information has been received from Donggala," Nugroho says.
According to a Red Cross statement, more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticised for not reporting that the tsunami had hit the island, although authorities said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floors of the building frantically shouts warnings about an approaching tsunami to people on the street.
Just minutes later, a wall of water hits the beach, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters was not immediately able to verify the authenticity of the imaging material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications around the Pali, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate their rescue efforts.
Officials say the army has begun sending transports from Jakarta and other cities, but those evacuated are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief efforts only, and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodon was scheduled to visit the Please evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision’s staff in Donggala have been able to escape to safety in the city of Please, where they have been housed in tent-cloth shelters in the inner courtyard of the office. On their way they passed the scene of the destruction, says Doseba.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he says.
It's really bad.
As relief groups began their desperate mission, some complained that foreign aid workers would be prevented from traveling to Return.
Under Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel can only begin flowing once the disaster area has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
“This is still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for Indonesia’s Red Cross.
“Once the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can start receiving international aid, but a declaration has not yet been made.”
When the second night landed on Pian after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, the friends and family of the missing were holding out hope that their loved ones would miraculously deviate from the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was lifted out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been in the rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's paragliding team, had coached two missing paragliders for the Asian Games earlier this month.
The Roa Roa Hotel also trapped his students, says Mandagi.
“As a senior member of the Hangover League, I have my own emotional burden,” he says.
Gendon said he had been desperately trying to reach the beach festival participants via WhatsApp messages after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel spread among the hang glider community.
However, the messages he sent were followed by only one grey note instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means no messages were sent,” he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 from an ATM in Newport on the Wide
The thieves took $26,750 from a Brink's security guard on Friday morning as he was replenishing an ATM machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department statement.
The driver of the car had been emptying and replenishing the ATM at the entertainment center, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While the attention of a Brink's employee was elsewhere, "a man ran behind him," stealing a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses saw a number of people fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number.
Persons with information about their identities are requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The character that used to be known as Kanye West."
Ye has been the nickname of 41-year-old West for some time now, and he also used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change comes ahead of his upcoming appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release a new album titled "Yandhi".
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the show's creator, withdrew from the show for "emotional reasons."
West has previously said that the word also has religious meaning for him, in addition to being an abbreviation of his professional name.
Discussing the album's title earlier this year with radio host Big Boy, West said, "I believe 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and there it means 'you'."
“I’m you, me, and all of us.
It started with Kanye, which means the only one, and ended up in the shorter form of Ye - which just embodies the goodness, the evil, the confusion, everything in us.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of several well-known rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
West’s former partner, Jay-Z, has also removed and returned the hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the president-elect of Mexico, has promised never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of student reprisals.
Lopez Obrador, who performed at the Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday, said he would "never use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
Armed forces fired on a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by offering monthly student support and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are driving young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. should double funding for AI research
The United States should double its funding for AI research as China streamlines its operations in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, a financier and AI professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The opinion was preceded by AI notifications from various parts of the US administration, even though the US lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: it aims to become a leading developer of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Doubled the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that other countries are so far behind the United States, and that we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the likelihood of the next major AI achievement in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee’s book “The Artificial Intelligence Powers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order” was published this month through Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, a publishing house that works as CEO of Sinovation Venture, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he developed an artificial intelligence system that surpassed the highest-ranked Othello player in the United States, and later served as executive director of Microsoft Research and director of Google's China operations.
Lee acknowledged past U.S. government technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and the Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held to identify future visionaries.
Lee says US scientists have worked hard to get public funding.
"Academic influencers are not being taken by China, but by big corporations," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited top universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States step up its AI efforts.
"I think that PhDs in artificial intelligence should automatically be awarded green cards," he said.
China’s government plans for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to individuals working in academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is inferior in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Defense Department’s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together industrial and academic partners, and the White House has announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
DARPA also announced a $2 billion investment in AI Next this month.
The NSF invests more than $100 million annually in AI research.
At the same time, the legislative initiative aimed at establishing a national security commission for artificial intelligence has not progressed for months.
Macedonians in referendum to change country name
In a referendum on Sunday, Macedonians voted to change the country’s name to the “Republic of North Macedonia”, a name change that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked the country’s bid for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, considers the name of its northern neighbour to be a territorial claim on its territory and has therefore opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the two countries reached an agreement on a new name proposal, but nationalist opponents say the change would weaken the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign against the vote raises doubts as to whether the required turnout will reach the 50% threshold in order for the result to be legal.
The question on the ballot was: 'Are you on the side of NATO and EU membership accepting the agreement with Greece?'
Proponents of the name change, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying the price so that Macedonia, which has emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, can apply for membership of both the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live in freedom as members of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgiyevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MEPs have said that they will respect the result of the vote in order for it to have a decisive impact.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the CEC, no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
Voter turnout, however, was only 16, compared to 34 per cent in the 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66 per cent of eligible voters cast their votes.
"I came to vote for my children and our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in a referendum on the change of Macedonia’s name in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018. The name change would open the way to NATO and EU membership.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of the tents erected by the boycotters in front of the Skopje parliament.
“We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not through the kitchen door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
“If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to something else, like China and Russia, as part of the Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe a large majority will vote in favour of the name change because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
He said the 'yes' vote was 'a way to our future'.
A poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research indicated a turnout of 30-43% in the referendum - below the required turnout.
In a second poll conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy per cent of them said they would vote for the 'yes' option.
For a referendum to be successful, the turnout must exceed 50% with one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious setback for the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Manchester City defender Sergio Aguero beats all of Brighton with goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a clean sweep of Brighton's defence in a 2–0 win over Manchester City at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made his goal at 65 minutes look ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the pattern, the top Argentine player received a pass from midfield.
He found an empty space in the field by storming through three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed past one defender and then left several others on the edge of the Brighton Penalty.
After that, he found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English tip used its first touch inside the penalty area to give the ball back to Aguero, who overtook Brighton guard Mathew Ryan's goal with a shot in the right corner.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that Aguero had “problems with his feet”.
"We said he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
Yes, it did.
We’re lucky he scored in that time.”
However, Sterling had already given the Sky Blues an advantage in the Premier League.
The goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero took the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He gave a beautiful pass to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane took a few touches before sending the ball to the rear pole towards Sterling.
The blue-sky attacker poke the ball into the net just before the end line.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a spoiler in a game against the Rockies
The Nationals are out of the playoffs, so why push for a starting lineup?
However, Scherzer, who is always competitive, hopes to take control of the supply mound in a Sunday game against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a playoff seam.
The Rockies took a wild card with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still aiming for their first division win.
“Even if we don’t have a bet, we can at least get up on the supply mound knowing that the crowd and the other team’s atmosphere here in Denver creates for me the most demanding race setup I’ve faced this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to take on the challenge?”
The Nationals have not yet released their initiator for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to give Scherzer a chance under the circumstances.
Scherzer threw a practice session on Thursday, playing his 34th game at the start and pitching on Sunday on his normal break.
The right-handed Washington player has an 18-7 win/loss ratio this season. The ERA is 2.53 and he has burned the batsman to the hive 300 times, innings at 220 2/3.
Trump's campaign in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation of his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the mid-term elections.
"All of our achievements will be at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important election of our lifetime.
This is one of the really big things -- I'm not just campaigning, I'm campaigning to the full, and that's why I'm going everywhere to fight for great candidates."
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
They are determined to return to power by any means necessary, and you can see their malice and malice.
They don't complain about who they're going to hurt or who they're going to have to overwhelm in order to get to power, that's what they want, power and power, but we're not going to give it to them."
He said the Democrats had taken on the task of "opposing and preventing."
“And it’s been visible for the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “angry and mean and malicious and false.”
When he referred to Dianne Feinstein, the longest-serving Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, the audience responded with loud booing.
"Do you remember his answer?
You leaked the document?
Uh, uh, what.
Well, no, I'll wait a bit - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a tolerant church.
It does not tolerate those who express their opinions
I was not really surprised when the Momentum activists in my local party supported a motion of censure against me.
After all, I'm just the last Labour representative in the line to be told I'm not welcome just because we say what we think.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way simply because of her strong opposition to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure was a criticism of my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On issues relating to responsible economic policy, to national security, to Europe, ironically similar issues, on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour meeting said on Friday that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of the eight years I have been a local Labour representative, the Friday meetings of the party council have been exactly that.
Now many meetings do not follow that tone, and the policy of 'friendly and gentler' has long since been forgotten, if it ever started.
It is increasingly clear that dissenting opinions are no longer tolerated in the Labour Party, and that every opinion is judged on whether or not it suits the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and colleagues with whom I thought I shared a similar political view began to expect a U-turn from me and positions that I would otherwise never have agreed to, whether in terms of national security or in terms of the EU internal market.
Whenever I speak in public - and it really does not matter what I say - the result is an avalanche of insults on social media calling for my election to be cancelled, for centrist politics to be rejected and for me to be told that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And it’s not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are, after all, political in nature.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexist and racist insults on a daily basis and who never waver.
The normalisation of ill-treatment is one of the most disturbing features of politics in this era.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn called for the Labour Party to adopt a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different opinions, and with every vote of no confidence or change in the rules of election, the party only becomes more limited.
For two years, I have been advised to keep a low profile and refrain from expressing my thoughts in order to ‘make everything go well’.
But that’s not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, as a result of Thatcher's government's neglect of the Integral School, I have worked, both as a city councillor and as a minister, to promote better public services for those who need them most.
I have never covered up my political line, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been surprised by my views or my disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that, as the state moves towards a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy questioning my trust in the Labour leadership.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents: I represent you with honor, and the threat of dismissal or the promotion of a political career does not prevent me from acting in a way that I believe is in your interest.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Undefeated Ayr at the Blockhead
The two last-minute goals slightly distorted the outcome of the match, but Ayr undeniably deserved to win the entertaining Tennent’s Premiership match of the day.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team out of ten that has not lost a single match.
A great defense and more successful risk-taking was, after all, what supported them, and coach Peter Murchie can rightly be pleased.
“We’ve been challenged in our matches and we’re still invincible, so I can be happy,” he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie says, “With all due respect to Ayr, they took risks better than we did.”
Ayr took the lead in 14 minutes with Grant Anderson's goal and Frazier Climo's successful conversion kick, but the Warriors' yellow card from Scottish captain Roy Hughes made Melrose's rise possible, and Jason Baggot scored.
Climo increased Ayri's lead with a penalty goal, and just before halftime he scored and managed a conversion kick, increasing Ayri's lead to 17-5.
But Melrose started the second round well with Patrick Anderson's goal, in which the conversion kick Baggot managed to narrow the gap to five points.
There was a long delay in the match when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and carried off the field. As the game continued, Ayr increased his lead with Stafford McDowall's goal, which Climo managed to achieve in a conversion kick.
Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, after which Bruce Colvine of Melrose scored a goal after heavy pressure, which the conversion kick did not succeed.
The home team, however, responded when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling the ballless Climo, and Macpherson scored from the tail of Ayr's maul.
Climo managed the conversion kick in the same way as before, and Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's kick and persuaded Gregor Henry to finish the home team's fifth goal.
Still Game series star starts in restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kieran has been named as the head of a licensed restaurant company and is expected to start working in the restaurant industry as well.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he co-writes with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning her life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is listed as a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor himself declined to comment, but a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan wanted to be part of Glasgow's thriving restaurant business.
'The sea belongs to us': landlocked Bolivia tries to reconnect with the Pacific Ocean through legal means
Sailors patrol outside the naval base in La Paz.
The flagpoles of public buildings carry a sea blue flag.
The naval bases from Titicaca to the Amazon have been tarnished with the slogan: "Justly, the sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to get it back.”
In inland Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody Resource War of the 19th century is still strong – as is the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean once more.
Hope is at its highest point in decades, as Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice ruling on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has a strong belief in progress, unity and serenity and, of course, a positive attitude in waiting for a final solution," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country are hopeful that the International Court of Justice’s ruling will be followed on the big screen, hoping that after decades of fragmentary debate, Bolivia’s position that Chile has an obligation to grant Bolivia independent access to the sea will be upheld in The Hague.
Bolivia’s charismatic president, Evo Morales, who faces a disputed battle for re-election next year, has a lot at stake in next Monday’s policy.
"The return to the Pacific is very close," he said in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in Bolivia's best interest, and even if it did, the situation would not change much.
A UN body of Dutch origin does not have the power to relinquish Chilean sovereignty, and the ICJ has stated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ's decision is only six months after the last of the comments suggests that the case "is not complex," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Moreover, the last four years have slowed down Bolivia's intentions rather than promoted them.
"The current Bolivian government has hijacked the issue of sea access," said Zárate.
“The rhetoric challenging Morales’ quarrel has stifled the rest of the goodwill of the Chileans,” he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold the talks afterwards.
Neither country has had an embassy since 1962.
The former President and Bolivian representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, does not accept the view that the Court's decision was exceptionally swift.
Monday gives Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to begin a new era in relations with Chile" and the opportunity "to put an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales, one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the maritime issue as a political aid.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to realize that it is time for us to move on from the past.”
North Korea says it will not denuclearize unless it can trust the United States
North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first unless it can rely on Washington, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said.
He spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He reminded the United States to keep the promises made by the Heads of State at the Singapore Summit.
R<0xC3><0xAD>’s statement came just before US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is resuming a deadlock in diplomacy with nuclear weapons, just three months after the United States met with Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was a "distant dream" to believe that extended sanctions and US opposition to the Korean War's end declaration would bring North Korea to its knees.
Until Pyongyang has taken significant steps to promote disarmament, Washington is alert to the adoption of the declaration.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a new summit.
But the view that Pyongyang is about to give up its arsenal, which the state probably sees as the only real way to ensure its own security, has been widely doubted.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump summit.
Paris Fashion Shows showcases the latest collection of large headwear that will soon be on your street
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely cover the sun, you don’t have to keep looking.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed at their SS19 show a selection of unusual oversized headwear that dazzled the Paris Fashion Week scene.
Very impractical headwear took over Instagram this summer, and these designers have also sent their amazing creations to fashion shows.
The most striking creation of Valentino was a beige hat with a wide plumage, which almost completely covered the ends of the models.
Other oversized accessories included a watermelon decorated with jewels, a wizard’s hat, and even a pineapple – but they’re not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Several colorful masks had sewn lips, and they resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high fashion.
One with a snorkel and mask resembled more like a diving equipment, and the other resembled a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to take a stand for big fashion, you’re in luck.
Followers of fashion predict that huge scarves will appear on the street.
The oversized hats closely follow "La Bomba", a straw hat with a half-meter brim that has been seen in everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult image of the impractical hat, which was widely seen on social media, also carried another large creation to the fashion shows – a beach bag made of straw, which is almost as big as the model carrying it.
Burnt orange raffia bag with white leather hand straps bordered with reed decoration was the most striking creation from Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famed stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see large-sized hats and beach bags on the street next summer – the designers have made such an impression that it would be hard to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories.”
John Edward: language skills are a key skill for global citizens
Learning outcomes in private schools in Scotland have traditionally been good, and this success has continued in 2018 as a result of good test scores, boosted by individual and community success in sport, art, music and other community-based initiatives.
These schools of more than 30,000 pupils, represented by SCIS, Scotland's Council of Private Schools, aim to provide a high level of service to their pupils as well as to the parents of pupils.
Private schools strive to prepare their students for careers of their choice, post-graduate and higher education, and global citizenship.
As an operator in the field of education, who can design and implement tailored study contents, we have noticed the status of languages as a popular and desirable subject in educational institutions.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a person in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to a person in his or her own language, the message goes to his or her heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on the English language if we want to build relationships of trust with people in other countries.
This year’s latest test results show that languages are at the top of the list in terms of pass rates among private schools.
Sixty-eight percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved the highest grade of A.
The data was collected from 74 schools belonging to SCIS and showed that 72% of the students who received the best grade were studying Mandarin, 72% were studying German, 69% were studying French and 63% were studying Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support the learning of foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently optional subjects, but they are valued in the same way as natural sciences (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the private school curriculum and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK’s Employment Office in 2014 revealed that 17 per cent of the situations where employers had difficulty finding a suitable employee were explained by insufficient language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore even more necessary in order to promote the future career development of young people.
The more language skills are required for possible tasks, the more relevant these skills become in the global world.
If a person has learned a second language, they will have an advantage in the future over this lifelong skill, regardless of which career they have chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner automatically puts a person with language skills ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey, 75 percent of more than 4,000 UK adults are unable to converse in a foreign language, with French being the only language spoken by 15 percent of the population.
That’s why investing in language teaching is now important for today’s children.
Knowledge of the languages of developing countries, in particular, gives children a better chance of finding a meaningful career.
Within Scotland, schools differ in the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on traditional languages, while some specifically teach languages that are expected to be important to British people in 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, private schools always have several language options taught by specialized teachers.
Private schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
At this time, it cannot be denied that in an international business environmentlanguages will continue to be of great importance for the country’s future, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be seen as 'international communication skills'.
Private schools will continue to provide this freedom of choice, diversity and high level for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of SCIS, Scotland's Council of Private Schools.
LeBron makes her debut Sunday in San Diego
The wait for LeBron James to make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the Denver Nuggets in a pre-season game in San Diego on Sunday.
But how many minutes he actually plays remains to be seen.
“It’s going to be more than one, and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play incomplete minutes.
James, who followed the drills, was asked earlier this week about his plans for the Lakers' six pre-season games.
“At this point in my career, I don’t need any more pre-match preparation,” he said.
Time of Trump's West Virginia campaign, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of election campaigns today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s Trump’s first of five election events scheduled for next week, including sympathetic sites such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote awaits his election to fill the seat of Supreme Court Justice, Trump is working to increase support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing a majority in Congress in the November election.
What time is Trump’s campaign in West Virginia today and how do you see it online?
Trump’s West Virginia Wheeling event begins at 7pm on the East Coast on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia campaign event online live streaming via YouTube by clicking below.
Trump is expected to comment on this week’s hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who became hot on sexual harassment charges that have delayed the Senate confirmation vote by as much as a week while the charges were being investigated by the FBI.
But the primary goal for the series of campaigns is to support the success of Republican candidates in the tight November election.
Thus, commenting on President Trump’s campaign, the purpose of these five events over the next week is to “wake up volunteer and profitable Republicans to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Dominating Congress is so essential to his purpose that the president is prepared to travel to as many states as possible during the hectic campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Today’s venue is the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, and supporters can even arrive from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump’s second visit this month to West Virginia, where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump has backed Republican candidate Patrick Morrisey, who has fallen behind in polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrissey that the president is trying to increase his support in polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Fighting Will to Keep Hope Alive Before Sunday's Singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon’s doubles was exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
While the self-affirming power of success in sports is a completely invented phenomenon, players still believe in it, and even more so in tournaments like this one.
Where, according to them, is this power of success at the moment?
“They had a six-point lead that narrowed down to four, so we’re taking this power of success as a nudge,” Jordan Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage: four points ahead and 12 to play.
The Americans, as Spieth said, feel that they have a bit of wind on the sails and a lot of encouragement, like the condition of Spieth and Justin Thomas, which allowed them to play all day together and get three points out of four.
Spieth has been a superior tile to the green, and leads by example.
The raucous voices of the victory party intensified as his round progressed, as he managed a critical putt to even out the match to exactly four, while he and Thomas were two points behind after two holes.
The putt, by which they won the 15th game, was followed by a similar scream, which gave the impression that he believed that the team of the United States had not yet lost.
"You have to concentrate really well and just take care of your own match," Spieth said.
That’s all these players have left.
18 holes to make an impact.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are the undisputed legends of the Ryder Cup, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe’s peculiar but sweet duo has won four out of four flawlessly.
"Moliwood" was the only duo that didn't make any bogies on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That tour, and the way they give and receive energy from this boisterous crowd, confirms that they are Sunday’s favourites, and when the sun goes down at Le Golf National, there could be no other more popular player to ensure a possible win for Europe than Fleetwood and Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time with different holes.
However, talk of Europe's success is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, a doubles champion with Alex Noren.
One bog and two double boggies on the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swede so deep into the pit that they were nowhere near surviving.
But on Sunday, no one will come and help you out of the hole.
Four-ball and doubles are fascinating to watch up close from the point of view of couples working together: What kind of advice they give or don’t give, and how strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and taken a significant lead before the last day, but this doubles showed that the US team has the will to fight, even though it is suspected, especially in the US.
Europe takes 10-6 lead before the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe is in a good lead ahead of the final day of the Ryder Cup, after they took a lead of 10-6 from the US in Saturday’s four-ball and doubles games.
The brilliant duo, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, led the winning streak with two wins over the rapping Tiger Woods, scoring four points today at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who worked hard to maintain their victory two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated the underdog U.S. team in the morning's four-ball game, taking the match 3-1.
The United States were the toughest opponent in doubles, winning two games, but they were unable to narrow the lead.
Jim Fury's half needed eight points from Sunday's 12 doubles to maintain the win.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to have won four points in a row. He and Molinari, also jointly referred to as "Molliwood", were the second duo in Ryder Cup history to have won four points in the first four games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they then finished with an even stronger 5–4 than the overwhelmingly disheartened Woods and U.S. beginner Bryson Dechambeau.
Woods, who barely made it through Saturday’s two matches, was at times extremely brilliant, but has nevertheless lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-ball and four-round, and even seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested the morning four-balls, but returned with Henrik Stenson to doubles, but lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked first and third.
Europe did not get everything it wanted on this fresh and pleasant day south-west of Paris.
Three-time qualifier Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high goal for the U.S. with two points on Saturday.
They scored a gruelling 2-1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball match, and later a 4-3 win over Spain's Poulter and Rory McIlroy in a four-ball match after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has the team risen from a four-point chase position to a level at the start of the doubles, although on the Fury side, a draw is enough to keep the win.
However, after two days second best, it may be that the Sunday counterattack is too much to ask for.
North Korea says it will not disarm without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions only increased mistrust of the United States, and under the circumstances there is no chance that North Korea will unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant measures of good will" over the past year, including stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site, and promising that North Korea will not increase the number of nuclear weapons or technology.
"However, we have not seen a similar gesture from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure that national security will be maintained, so under these circumstances it is not possible to disarm unilaterally.”
While Ri echoed the well-known lamentation that Washington would not accept a phased denuclearization, where North Korea would be rewarded for each milestone, his statement is nonetheless significant in the sense that unilateral disarmament was not completely excluded, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first U.S.-North Korea summit in Singapore on June 12th. In the statement, Kim asserted “the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” and Trump promised to guarantee North Korea’s security.
North Korea tried to officially end the Korean War of 1950–53, but the United States insisted that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed easing tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States demands ‘nuclear disarmament first,’ and has increased the pressure through sanctions to achieve its goals by force — even opposing the ‘proclamation of peace,’” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions will bring us to our knees is the dream of the indifferent.
But the problem is that continued sanctions only deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans to hold the next Kim-Trump summit, which Trump himself highlighted to the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the party calling for disarmament were South Korea and not the United States, the situation would not have reached such an impasse."
Yet Rin’s tone was markedly different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that missiles aimed at the continental United States were inevitable after the “evil president” Trump called Kim a “missile man” with suicidal intentions.
Just last year, Trump threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, but this year Trump praised Kim for his courage to approach disarmament, but stressed that there is still a lot of work to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea abandons nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit: “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia have suggested that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the progress it has already made.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “the strengthening of sanctions by the Security Council must continue vigorously and without fail until we witness a complete, final and reinforced nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with the aim of cutting off Pyongyang’s financial channels for the production of ballistic and nuclear missiles.
Mr Pompeo met with North Korea's Rin in the margins of the UN General Assembly and announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month in preparation for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the latest visit was not smooth.
On leaving Pyongyang, he described progress being made, but North Korea condemned Pompeo's "gangster-like demands" only a few hours later.
North Korea committed to shutting down the missile base and nuclear facility at a meeting with Secretary-General Moon earlier this month in the event that the United States takes “similar measures.”
According to Pompeo, Kim means “similar measures” to the security guarantees that Trump committed to at the Singapore meeting and a move toward normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course to get enough rest
All undergraduate students at Harvard University attend a course this year designed to increase student rest. The course is a backlash to the university’s thriving macho culture, where students spend a long night with the power of caffeine.
According to the researcher, the students of the best university in the world are often quite ignorant of the basic issues related to their own well-being.
The course, designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of medicine at Harvard University who works on sleep research at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, believes the course will be the first of its kind in the United States.
Czeisler came up with the idea for the course after lecturing on the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
“After the lecture, a young woman came to me and said, ‘Why am I only hearing about this now, in my last year of study?’
No one had ever told him about the need for sleep, which I was surprised,” he told The Telegraph.
For the first time this year, the course will guide students on how correct sleep patterns support academic and athletic performance and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor at Harvard Medical School and vice president of the university’s health services, said the university decided to hold a course after hearing about students suffering severe sleep deprivation during the study week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, students are shown a picture of a dormitory room where they can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep deprivation on sports performance and the importance of regular evening activities.
In the second section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
With interactive icons, the campus map encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
"We know that this does not have a direct impact on student behavior.
We believe, however, that they have a right to know about these issues in exactly the same way that they have a right to know about the health effects of smoking," adds Professor Czeisler.
According to Professor Czeisler, all-night study marathons are still a source of pride, and modern technology and the ever-increasing pressures on students made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
“Adequate and quality sleep should be a student’s ‘secret weapon’ against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes a brain state that resembles starvation, which is why people are constantly hungry.”
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical psychology in California, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of the courses he taught in his first year at Harvard last year.
She says that the course opened her eyes and gave her the impetus to organise a course that would cover all the students on the campus.
He hopes that all doctoral students could complete a similar course of study before moving on to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm clock to remind them of bedtime in addition to waking up in the morning, as well as reminding them to keep in mind the adverse effects of electronic displays and “blue light” from LED lighting on circadian rhythms, which can make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's shot beat Gerrard's players
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers had another losing day when Dolly Menga's shot through the broken defense brought Livingston a 1–0 win.
Ibrox players were looking for their first win since February 4–1 against St. Johnstone. This time, however, Gary Holt's team took the win, and Gerrard only suffered his second defeat in his 18-game manager career. The Rangers were eight points away from the current Premier League manager, Hearts.
Menga scored the ball seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers' downed fighting spirit did not level the playing field after that.
The Rangers fell to sixth place, but Livingston climbed to third, with only Hibernia in the goal difference.
The Rangers may have other problems, as Calum Spence was injured during the game when an object was thrown from the away stands, and the wound had to be treated.
Gerrard made eight substitutions for the team to beat Ayr and advance to the Scottish League Cup semi-finals.
Holt continued with the same Livi 11 line-up that the team took away a point from the Hearts last week, and the same strategy worked again when a well-built line-up managed to discipline the opponent at almost every turn.
Although the Rangers managed to dominate possession of the ball, Livingston was better off using the situation to his own advantage.
Livingston had a chance to score at two minutes when Menga's first assist gave Scott Pittman a clear path to Allan McGregor's goal, but Pittman was unable to take advantage of the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed his free kick to Craig Halkett, but the other defender, Alan Lithgow, only managed to shoot wide into the rear pole.
The Rangers, on the other hand, took control of the game, but in the last third of the game, there was no longer any self-confidence in the air.
Alfredo Morelos demanded a penalty after a 15-minute run-in between him and Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's request.
The Rangers only managed to score two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly managed to easily counter Lassana Coulibaly's butt and Ovie Ejaria's impotent shot.
Livingston’s goal at 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but it wasn’t just because of the team’s hard work.
The Rangers still couldn't do anything about Jacobs' long pitching tactics.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher pitched to Scott Robinson, who cold-headedly delivered the ball to Menga for an easy goal.
During the switch, Gerrard decided to switch Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent on the field. The switch affected the game almost immediately, as Kent created a suitable opening for Morelos. However, the attack was interrupted by Kelly's effect on the quick defense.
Livingston made the visitors play their game again, as Lithgow and Halkett continued to make long passes one after the other.
Holt's team had the opportunity to raise their lead in the final moments of the game, but McGregor's fine defense thwarted Jacobs' plans before Lithgow could get to his position at the corner.
Glenn Middleton of the Rangers also demanded a penalty kick after clashing with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: Geiger counter inventor
Next page of our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882. Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, the future physicist, was born in Germany today 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which later led to the development of a device known as a geiger counter.
The method became one of the mainstays of science, and the meter is also a central concept of pop culture. For example, the film "Coronado watches", which appeared in 1950, in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play quite cowherd-like scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger counter. It's used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put your headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals.”
Evans: "Look, now it's really rattling!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Malignant Cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells and destroy them
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Malignant Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves isolating resistant cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory
After treatment, the cells injected back into the body are able to ‘see’ the proteins typical of many cancers
The test vaccine has shown promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
For example, the cancer cells of a patient with ovarian cancer disappeared within 18 months of being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method involves isolating resistant cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they are able to ‘see’ the HER2 proteins typical of many cancers. The modified cells are then injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, U.S.A., describes the method: “Based on our results, it is a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "controls the growth of several types of cancer," explains Professor Berzofsky. "These include breast cancer as well as ovarian, lung and colon cancers."
A similar approach —taking resistant cells from a patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells— has also been successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West was greeted by critics after praising Trump on Saturday Night Live wearing a campaign hat.
The show didn't go as planned.
Kanye West was booed on Saturday Night Live after praising President Donald Trump and announcing his candidacy for the 2020 election.
After performing the evening’s third song, “Ghost Town,” in Trump’s Make America Great Again campaign hat, West attacked the Democrats and reiterated his support for President Trump.
“Often when I talk to a white person, they ask me how can I support Trump because he’s a racist.
“If racism were a problem, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The evening's broadcast began with a sketch in which Matt Damon made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in connection with allegations of sexual harassment by Kavanaugh made by Christine Blasey Ford.
West's rant was not broadcast live, but comedian Chris Rock posted a clip of it on social media.
It is not clear whether Rock intended to mock West with his post.
Mr West also complained to the public that he had been ill-treated because of the hat he was wearing behind the scenes.
"I was bullied behind the scenes.
I was told not to go on stage with this hat on.
I've been bullied!
Then they still say I’m on the margins,” West said in an interview with the Washington Examiner.
West continues, “Do you want to see what it means to be marginalized?” and says he wears the Superman cape because “then you can’t control what I do.
Try with love.”
According to Variety, West's comments sparked booing from the audience at least twice, and the show's performers looked embarrassed. One of those present described the situation to the magazine as follows: "The whole studio went completely silent."
West was chosen at short notice to replace Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused confusion in many viewers by performing "I love it" dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West has the support of conservative TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who praised his courage on Twitter: "THANK YOU FOR THREATING THE RUSSY VICTORY."
Karen Hunter, the talk show’s director, tweeted: “West is just being himself, which is absolutely wonderful.”
However, I can decide to BE UN SUPPORTED by a person (buying his music or clothing brand or supporting his “art”) who I believe supports and propagates an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
The same goes for us,” he added.
The rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to "the person formerly known as Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name, following Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was also known as Snoop Lion, and of course we also remember the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to the symbol and later to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Belfast restaurant stabber charged with attempted murder
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after he was stabbed in a restaurant in Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in the Ballyhackamore area.
The defendant is expected to appear before a court in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecution is reviewed by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-wielding heroic role as Jon Snow in the HBO violent fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, Harrington has attacked the macho hero stereotype: According to the 31-year-old actor, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned through hard work.
In an interview with the Sunday Times’ cultural supplement, Harrington suspects that “something has gone wrong” in the matter, and questions the means available to tackle toxic masculinity in the era of the #MeToo phenomenon.
Recently married to 31-year-old Rose Leslie, another Star of the Game of Thrones, Harrington admits that she has a strong desire to address the issue.
“The question of where we’ve gone wrong with masculinity evokes powerful emotions in me right now,” she says.
“What have men been taught in the years of their growth that has led to the problems now being seen?”
Harrington believes that television and its highly masculine characters are partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continues: “What is innate and what is learned?
What do you learn on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel like they have to be a certain way to be men?
I think this is one of the great questions of our time – how can we change this?
There is something seriously wrong with young people.”
In the interview, he also admits that he would not be involved in the production of the prequels or sequels to the Game of Thrones after the series ends next summer, as he has, in his own words, "got enough of the battlefields and horses."
In November, Harrington will appear in a new version of Sam Shepard's play True West, which tells the story of the film producer and his brother-in-law.
The actress recently revealed that getting to know her future wife Rose was the best the Game of Thrones has offered her.
“I met my wife on this show, so in a way it gave me my future family and my life from then on,” she says.
Rose Leslie played Ygritte, the target of Jon Snow's love interest in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 on the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: New infections in China up 14%
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say the virus affects more than 820,000 people in the country.
About 40,000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been mediated through sex, which means a change in previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China through contaminated blood transfusions.
However, according to the Chinese health authorities who spoke at the conference in Yunnan province, HIV infections that have taken place in this way have been reduced to almost zero.
A year later, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has risen by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been reported to be common.
Studies have estimated that because of the country’s conservative values, 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many of the infections are caused by insufficient protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to ensure universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employee leaked Republican senator’s information and accuses him of spreading “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, on Saturday denied allegations that her employee posted personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages about them.
A Democratic congressman from Los Angeles asserted that the allegations were spread by “extreme-right” commentators and websites.
“Lies, lies and more despicable lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Among the information released was the home addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and Utah State Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
An unknown person released the information from the U.S. Congress Thursday during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred shortly after Kavanaugh was interrogated by three senators.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that, according to the Hill newspaper, the messages were published from an IP address connected to Waters’ office and by a member of Waters’ staff.
“This baseless accusation is completely false and is an absolute lie,” Water said.
“My employees, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations, are in no way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This unsubstantiated accusation is completely and absolutely false.”
Waters’ statement was quickly criticized on the internet, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"The way he denies this is very hostile," Fleischer wrote.
"It seems that his character is not suited to a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he has no reason to behave in a hostile manner.
There's no reason to be arrogant.
There's no reason to question the prosecutor's motives.
You have to behave calmly and calmly.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too hostile during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is competing for Waters’ seat in the midterm elections, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
"It's unbelievable if this is true," he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said he had "contacted the appropriate authorities and law enforcement bodies about these fraudulent allegations.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed,” he continued, “and that they are held legally responsible for any and all destructive and dangerous actions against some or all of my staff.”
Johnny English Strikes Again: Rowan Atkinson's Agent Parody
It’s an established tradition to look for Brexit references in any film that has a slight UK bias, but this doesn’t seem to fit in with Johnny English’s Agent Parody and Action Comedy series, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came to life again in the 2011 sequel “Johnny English – Reborn”.
Can a tongue-in-cheek nation satire become Britain’s new national export success?
Either way, the gooey, caraway-faced and incompetent Johnny English has earned his permission to screw up for the second time. His name alone says above all that this is a comical creation aimed at the film market outside the English-speaking world.
It is, of course, the case of that dopey secret agent who is desperately trying to infuse herself with smooth glamour, but appears to be a mixture of Inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean and the unfortunate one-note musician at the London 2012 opening concert.
The character is based on a chaotic cosmopolitan and mysterious man of the world, who Atkinson played in the already forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials.
The last show has its moments.
I especially liked the scene where Johnny English arrives in a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the rotor blades pierce his helmet.
While Atkinson’s physical comedy has its gifts, the humor itself seems under-powered and oddly unnecessary, especially since ‘serious’ movie brands such as 007 and The Dangerous Task now offer humor as part of the film’s core content.
The humor seems to be directed at children, and Johnny English’s mad treatment does not seem to me as resourceful and as perceptive as Atkinson’s Mr. Bean’s silent comedy.
The starting point, which is repeated every year, is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain’s top-secret spy network and exposes the identities of all the British agents on the ground to the dismay of the operative – portrayed as an unfortunate minor performance by Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for a pompous and intractable prime minister who is already in the grip of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything in the skins of the Teresa May parody character, but the script just doesn’t give her enough space.
When intelligence advisers inform him that all the spies on the ground have been exposed, he must call for help someone who has already retired from active service.
This is Johnny English, of course, in his own person. He spends his retirement as a high school teacher, but at the same time gives informal lessons in the noble art of espionage. The subject triggers some clever jokes; English holds School of Rock-type lessons in the secrets of intelligence work.
English is rushed to an emergency meeting in Whitehall, where she meets again with her endlessly patient partner, Bough, who is still played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine commander whose role Vicki Pepperdine doesn't seem to qualify for.
So the disastrous Batman and Robin have returned to Her Majesty's secret service to confront the deadly supervillain Ophelia Bhuletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is being manipulated by a charismatic IT billionaire, and Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems.
The odyssey of English and Bough turns into a farce: the two, disguised as waiters, set fire to a fine French restaurant and cause chaos as they try to sneak into Volta’s luxury yacht. An attempt to familiarise themselves with Volta’s house with the help of virtual goggles ends up in pure anarchy in the real world.
The filmmakers’ last inhibitions will be shattered at the end of the scene, but despite all the powerlessness and charm, the film still feels a little made for a child audience.
The film can be considered moderate.
Watching Johnny English movies, I’ve come to the same conclusion before: why can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent?
UK Labour rejects plans for four-day working week with five-day pay
Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is considering a radical plan that would allow Britons to work four days a week, but be paid for five days.
The party is said to require business leaders to pass on the savings of the artificial intelligence revolution to the workers in the form of an extra day off.
According to the plan, employees would be able to enjoy three-day weekends at the same salary.
According to sources, the idea would be “suitable” for the party’s economic programme and its plans to incline politics to the benefit of the workers.
The trade union confederation supports the move to a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economic situation.
A high-level Labour source told the Sunday Times: "The revision of the line is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
The change will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support the idea: the British Green Party committed to supporting a four-day working week as part of its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, this objective will not receive undivided support from Labour.
A Labour spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not the party's policy, and the party is not considering moving to one."
Shadow Finance Minister John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour Conference to present his vision for an economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to recover power from “faded dictators” and “speculators” of corporations.
According to the plans of the Shadow Finance Minister, the current shareholders of the water companies would not get their shares back in full, as the Labour-led government would be able to implement "reductions" on the basis of observed abuses.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on company boards and create funds for inclusive ownership, which would allow 10% of the share capital of private sector companies to be transferred to employee management, with a maximum of <0xC2><0xA3>500 in dividends per employee per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discuss on 60 Minutes whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed at least a week the final vote on Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court. The delay also raises the question of whether the outcome of the investigation could undermine some Republican senators' support for Kavanaugh's appointment.
In the 60 Minutes Sunday episode, Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it was possible for the FBI to find out things that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said when I went to the hearing... I said I'd spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this had happened when the charges came up and asked him, ‘Did you do this?’
He was determined, determined, unequivocal.”
Graham's voice, on the other hand, looks like it's been carved in stone.
"I've made my decision with Brett Kavanaugh and it's bomb-proof," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know this: Brett flatly denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of the people he named were able to confirm it.
This is a 36-year-old issue.
I don’t see what could change.”
What is Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival, held in New York City on Saturday, is a music event with a cast as impressive as its mission: to eradicate poverty from the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival draws tens of thousands of people to New York’s Central Park lawns to listen to performers like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make known the true goal of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is a follow-up to the Global Powerty Project, an international advisory group that aims to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively working to eradicate it.
In order to get a free ticket to an event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the public must perform various tasks or “acts”, such as volunteering, sending an email to a political decision-maker or making a phone call, or performing some other act that spreads awareness of the project’s goals.
But how has Global Citizen been successful, now that we only have 12 years to reach our goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert ticket a real way to persuade them to take action, or is it just another ‘clickivism’ among others – the idea that you can change the world by signing an online address or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “actions” for different purposes since 2011.
These actions have encouraged policymakers to announce commitments and principles equivalent to more than $37 billion, and have been used in ways that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and statements on the basis of which more than $10 billion has already been spent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds reached have already affected the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based group of investors and executors committed to “helping children develop to their full potential.” The group committed to providing Rwanda with $35 million to end malnutrition in the country, after activists sent them 4,700 tweets as a result of the Global Citizen campaign.
“Thanks to the British government, donors, governments of different countries, and global citizens just like you, we can put social injustice and malnutrition in the history of the press,” Tracey Ullman, the ambassador for Power of Nutrition, told the audience at a concert in London in 2018.
The group also called on the British government to take action to improve the nutrition of mothers and children through more than 5,000 actions. The government has announced funding for the Power on Nutrition project, which focuses on fighting malnutrition and reaches 5 million mothers and children.
One of the most frequently asked questions on the movement’s website is, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global citizen’s answer: “The road will be long and difficult and there are many stumbling blocks ahead.
But we will succeed, like the great civil rights struggles and anti-apartheid movements before us, because together we are stronger.”
Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the New York concert this year, and its star squad includes artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe.
U.S. Department of Homeland Security says the country can make energy exports more difficult by using navy as a “barrier”
U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke, quoted in the Washington Examiner, said Washington could "if necessary" rely on its navy to help stop the spread of Russian energy on the world market, including the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia’s actions in Syria – at the invitation of the legitimate government – are an excuse for exploring new energy markets in the region.
“I believe that the reason [for Russia’s] presence in the Middle East is the transmission of energy, just as in Eastern Europe, in the southern half of Europe,” Zinke said.
According to the official, there are ways and means available to prevent this.
“The United States has the ability to keep shipping routes open through its fleet and, if necessary, by blockade to ensure that the energy they provide doesn’t end up on the world market,” he says.
Zinke spoke to an audience at an event organized by the Association of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group that profiles itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington’s approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that it is one and the same thing.
"The economic alternative for Iran and Russia is more or less speculation, and replacing fuel with another," he says, describing Russia as "a one-trick circus act" whose economy is based on fossil fuels.
The statements come at a time when the Trump administration has sought to boost LNG exports to Europe, replacing much cheaper Russian LNG.
To make this more effective, the Trump administration, including President Trump, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to President Trump, ties Berlin to Moscow’s leash.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the existing pipeline’s capacity of 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that there are purely economic reasons behind Washington’s opposition, and sees it as an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure and that consumers should have the choice of supplier,” said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The attitude of the United States has provoked a reaction in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The country's leading industry umbrella organisation, the German Confederation of Industry, has urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I find it very problematic that a third country interferes in our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, head of the German Confederation of Industry, said recently after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, plans to carefully consider running for president in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she was “carefully considering” running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidacy for an open poll in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our flawed administration, and that means a woman in the lead of the kingdom,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will carefully consider running for president.”
Warren described President Donald Trump as “taking the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
According to a poll released on Thursday, a majority of Warren’s voters are not in favor of his candidacy in 2020.
According to a study by the University of Suffolk’s Department of Political Science and the Boston Globe, 58% of “probable” voters in Massachusetts do not support a senator’s candidacy.
32% were in favour of being nominated.
A majority of respondents were in favour of former Governor Deval Patrick running for governor with 38%, while 48% were against the idea.
Other prominent Democratic candidates in the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden has said he will formally decide on his candidacy by January.
Sarah Palin refers to her son’s war traumas at Donald Trump’s election rally
Sarah Palin's son Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the military in September.
Track Palin arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence
“From what my own son has to go through after returning home, I can relate well to the other families who are facing the consequences of PTSD and the injuries that our returning soldiers bear,” he told an audience gathered at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest “a hippo in the living room” and said his son, like other war veterans, “will return home a little changed, they will return hardened, they will come back wondering if there will be respect for what he and his comrades in the army and air force have done for this country.”
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, according to Wasilla police spokesman Dan Bennett, who was charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as domestic violence and handling of a gun while intoxicated.
18 States and District of Columbia Support New Asylum Procedures
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are seeking an amendment to a new policy in the U.S. that says asylum will not be granted to people fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and federal districts have filed a “Friends of Justice” letter in Washington on Friday in support of asylum seekers who violate the policy, NBC News reports.
The plaintiff’s full name has not been disclosed in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy.
He says he was beaten by his partner "and his sons from a violent gang" and denied asylum by US authorities on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The public prosecutor, who supported Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where the majority of asylum seekers in the United States come from, as countries where gang violence and domestic violence are a widespread problem at all levels of society.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Asylum Appeals Board that undocumented migrants could seek asylum on the grounds of domestic violence.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores state, federal and international law for decades."
“Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be decided on the basis of the facts and circumstances specific to the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” the letter reads.
Prosecutors also claim in the letter that the practice of barring asylum seekers from entering harms the U.S. economy, as the arrivals are likely to become entrepreneurs and "bring in the necessary additional labor force."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to suspend asylum for victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is intended for people who are fleeing their home country because of persecution or fear of belonging to a race, religion, nationality, or a particular social group, or because of political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems—even serious ones—people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue of survivors continues in Palu – death toll has already doubled
For the survivors, the situation is even more serious.
“The situation is very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she soothed her feverish baby in a Please evacuation center in a ruined city.
“Ambulances are bringing in new bodies every minute.
We are running out of clean water.”
Residents return to their destroyed homes, pick up their watery belongings and try to save what remains to be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured and the hospitals damaged by the magnitude 7.5 quake are full.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who suffers from fractures of the spine and shoulder, rest outside the army hospital, where patients are treated for constant, intense aftershocks.
His eyes are filled with tears as he recounts how a violent earthquake shook a fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to rescue.
Harris tells the Associated Press that he and his family were in town as wedding guests.
“I heard my wife screaming for help and then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of 'Provocation' of 'Propaganda'
The US Ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the American newspaper as a propaganda tool, a week after a four-page advertisement in a US newspaper praising the mutual interests of the US-China trade agreement.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to a paid supplement in the China Daily newspaper Des Moines Register, the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of meddling in the November 6 congressional elections. China has denied the allegations.
Trump’s accusations of Beijing’s meddling in the U.S. elections mark a new stage in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for a foreign government to spread notifications to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an ever-escalating trade war in which both sides take turns imposing tariffs on the other’s exports.
According to Chinese and American experts, China’s retaliatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were targeted at states such as Iowa that supported the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and long-time Governor of the State of Iowa, says Beijing has done damage to workers, farmers and businesses in the United States. Iowa is a major exporter of agricultural products to China.
China "is now accelerating its provocations even further by publishing propaganda announcements in our own free press," Branstad wrote in an op-ed published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday.
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government benefits from the esteemed tradition of free speech and the press in the United States by placing a paid ad on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, the Beijing street newsstands show only limited dissenting opinions, and the real, dissenting opinions that Chinese citizens may have about the alarming development of their economy are not seen at all. This is because the media is firmly under the leadership of the Communist Party of China," he writes.
Branstad goes on to say that "one of China's largest newspapers declined an offer to publish" the article he had written, but did not specify which newspaper it was.
Kavanaugh Fiasco Deports Female Voters From Republicans, Analysts Warn
The fact that many of the top Republican names are backing and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh could trigger a backlash, analysts say, especially among female voters in the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions surrounding the incident have been running high, and most Republicans have already expressed a desire to move forward with the vote.
“These things cannot be undone,” says political science professor Grant Reeher of the Maxwell Institute at Syracuse University, in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher doesn’t believe Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute offer of an FBI investigation will appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday and they will not be forgotten tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and spokesperson for MoveOn, a national reform group in the capital.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming” as they demonstrated in the corridors of the Senate Judiciary Committee as the ruling Republicans decided to proceed with Kavanaugh’s appointment, which happened despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be evaluable," says Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site.
“People say that the excitement has already been high, and that’s true.
But it could be even greater, especially among insecure female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29-year-olds who often don’t vote because they don’t like the president.”
Analysts predict a possible counter-reaction if the Republicans advance with confirmation even before Ford's testimony against the Supreme Court nominee, in which he made his allegation of sexual harassment.
“This is becoming a mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, a former Republican National Committee spokesman, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is going to be questioned, it's about how the Republicans have acted and how they've treated Ford," Guy Cecil, the leader of the pro-Democrat group Priorities USA, told the news channel.
Americans, however, appear to be somewhat divided over whether they should believe Ford’s or Kavanaugh’s testimony, with a narrow majority yielding to the latter.
According to a new poll by YouGov, 41% of respondents believe Ford’s testimony absolutely or probably, while 35% say they absolutely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake pushed the case forward, the FBI will investigate allegations made by Ford and at least one other suspect, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford testified before the court that Kavanaugh had harassed him when Ford was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee revealed his genitals to him at a student party while they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet as a counterattack to Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to which data.
In an interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt intended to "rule the world".
"It has to be done now," he said, referring to his start-up company.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid’s technology to enable people to create their own “personal data repository” or POD.
It can include contact lists, notepads, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique about personal data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who has access to what types of data.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through information.”
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea of Inrupt is to provide the resources, processes and skills required to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some paid developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Technology developers around the world can create their own distributed applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website. All of this will be available starting this week.
Berners-Lee says he and his team aren’t discussing “with Facebook and Google whether people should be offered a complete transformation where all their business models are turned on their heads overnight.”
“We’re not going to ask for their consent.”
Berners-Lee wrote in a Medium article on Saturday that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem for the integrity and quality of a new network built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute after the launch of Inrupt.
“I am extremely optimistic for the next era of the network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the city remembers the hero priest of the First World War
The city celebrates the 100th anniversary of the only priest in the Church of England to have been awarded the Victoria Cross Medal as a soldier.
The Medal of Courage was awarded to Lt. Col. Bernard Vanni on 29 September 1918, following the events of the attack on the villages of Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
Vann, however, died four days later and was never heard of the highest honour the British Army had ever received.
Two of his grandchildren were unveiling a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, last Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says the event is “an impressively symbolic one”; the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years after the feat of his award-winning grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, 29 9.1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quent "in very dense fog and under heavy field artillery and machine guns."
Later, he plunged into the front line and, "with the greatest bravery", led the advance of the troops before storming the field artillery alone. In the ensuing battle, Vann knocked down three artillery battery soldiers with his own hands.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s deed was “something I could never do, something that inspires respect.”
Michael Vann He and his brother Dr James Vann laid down a wreath after a parade with the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says it's "a great honor to take part in the parade," adding, "a great crowd is remembering the honor of a true hero."
The fans of the MMA match waited up all night for the Bellator 206 tournament – the TV channel showed Peppa Pig
Imagine a situation where you’ve stayed up all night to watch the expected Bellator 206 tournament, and the whole event isn’t shown.
The event in San Jose featured 13 matches, including six main series matches, and was scheduled to be broadcast live in the UK on Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the ring, the show changed to Pipsa Pig's great dismay.
Some of the spectators were not really happy after staying up all night because of the match.
One MMA fan opened up on Twitter, describing the replacement of the match with a children's cartoon as "some kind of sick joke".
"According to the law, this content was not appropriate for the 6:00 a.m. show, so they had to switch it to a children's program," Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, said in a statement.
"Baby Pig, yes."
Bellator chief executive Scott Coker said schedules will be worked on so UK viewers can follow events in the future.
"I'm thinking about a rebroadcast that will probably make the program work," Coker said.
"But it's 6 a.m. there, and we can't get the show on before Sunday, which is Monday of their time.
We're working on it.
You can believe that when the program changed in their heads, messages started going in one direction or another, and they weren’t all friendly.
We tried to correct the error because we thought it was a technical problem.
However, this was not the case; it was a legislative matter.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We limit the number of matches to five instead of six, as usual, trying to give our fans more and trying too hard.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Jumper and Olympic athlete Tom Daley says he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but that motivates him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete says he didn’t realize until he was in high school that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, Lauren Laverne said she had spoken about gay rights to give people "hope."
He also says that after having a child, winning the Olympics wasn’t so important after all.
Kristy Young, a long-time radio host, has taken several months off due to illness.
While appearing as a guest on Laverne's first show, Daley said she felt "less" than everyone else when she was young because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and work".
To this day, these feelings, feeling less and different, have been a reality, and they have given me the strength and energy I needed to succeed.
She says she wanted to show that she was ‘something’ so that she wouldn’t disappoint everyone when her sexuality was finally revealed.
A two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist, and he will appear at this year’s Commonwealth Games to appeal for the criminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came forward because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences, and wanted to give other people ‘hope’.
The three-time world champion says she fell in love with the man — American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 — “became a surprise.”
Daley married this 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but says the age difference has never been a problem.
“If you’re experiencing so many things at such a young age” — he attended his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later — “it’s hard to find another of his age who has experienced similar ups and downs,” Daley says.
The couple had a son in June – Robert Ray Black-Daley – and as a result, Daley’s “whole perspective” has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, my life would have revolved around winning a gold medal,” he says.
You know, there are bigger things than a gold medal in the Olympics.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
His son was named after Daley’s father, who died in 2011 at the age of just 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said that his father never accepted that he would die, and one of the last things he asked Daley about was the ticket to the 2012 Olympics. He wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him he wasn’t going to be around to be in the front row anymore,” Daley says.
"I held her hand when her breathing stopped. It wasn't until her breathing really stopped and she was dead that I finally realized she wasn't invulnerable," she says.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I knew this was something I’d dreamed of all my life – jumping in front of a home crowd at the Olympics. There’s no better feeling,” says Daley.
This was also the inspiration for her first song selection on the air – Heather Small’s song “Proud” – which was already stirring emotions in her preparation for the Olympics, and which still makes her goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson on the bench at Saturday’s Ryder Cup
Phil Mickelson breaks the record on Sunday by playing his 47th round of the Ryder Cup, but he has to make a big leap to avoid the record going down in history as an unfortunate performance.
Mickelson, who plays in the biannual event for the 12th time in a record time, was substituted by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday’s fourball and foursome.
The American five-time Major tournament winner, usually the center of attention, now spent half the day as a cheerleader and the other half on the pitch trying to get his punch under control.
The 48-year-old Mickelson, who wasn’t even considered one of the most accurate drivers at the peak of his career, isn’t the ideal choice for a tight-knit Le Golf National, where a long-skinned roughback punishes for imprecise punches.
If there isn’t enough opposition on the pitch for Mickelson, Sunday’s ninth game will be against British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who will be playing alongside newcomer Tommy Fleetwood, who is aiming for all four wins this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind in 12 singles, get a flying start, Michelson’s game could prove to be extremely important.
Furyk has expressed his confidence in his player, but what else could be said in the situation.
"He perfectly understands the role he played today. He patted me on the back, squealed and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
"He is undoubtedly one of the best players and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I didn’t think he would play two games.
I thought otherwise, but this is how it went and this is the solution we came to.
He wants to be on the field as much as anyone.”
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It could also mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which, admittedly, was never comparable to his personal performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Fury says his presence brings something undefined to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to prank people, and he’s a funny guy that everybody likes to be around,” she explains.
"The younger players must have had a lot of fun with him this week, too.
He brings so much more to the team than just his contribution to the game.”
Team Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows how long a lead can disappear quickly
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Team Europe, knows from experience that the Ryder Cup’s massive lead ahead of the final day doubles could turn into a bumpy ride.
The Danish player made her debut in 1997 at Valderrama, where Seve Ballesteros led the side with a five-point lead over the Americans, but who came out on the winning streak with just the size of his nose and won with the narrowest margin of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 to 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“It reminds itself of how we led briskly at Valderrama, we led briskly at Brookline, where we lost, but we won at Valderrama, albeit a little bit,” Bjorn said after watching the 2018 team’s 5-3 wins on Friday and yesterday, moving to a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
“History will show both me and everyone on the team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we'll fire a big caliber.
We go to the airport and do everything right.
The game is not over until the numbers are on the board.
We have a goal, we are trying to win that prize, and that is all we are aiming for.
As I’ve always said, I’ll focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we’re aware of what’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Delighted by how his team players have performed on a difficult pitch, Bjorn adds: "I never lick until I drop in such matters.
Tomorrow is completely different.
Tomorrow, we will focus on individual performances, and then we will talk about different things.
It’s great to be on the pitch with a partner when everything is going well, but when you’re alone on the pitch, that’s when the player’s capacity is tested to the brim.
This is the message that needs to be conveyed to the players – tomorrow everyone will be able to perform at their best.
Now you have to let go of the partner, who gets to go [to the field alone] and do his best.”
Unlike Bjorn, opposing captain Jim Furyk will require his players to perform better as individuals than they could as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk, on the other hand, has experienced the last day’s turnarounds in both directions. He was part of the winning team at Brookline before becoming a loser when the European team won with the “Miracle of Medinah”.
“I remember every damn word,” he said when asked about how the 1999 captain, Ben Crenshaw, stretched his team’s lines to the final day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start, just like Brookline did, or Medinah did.
When you get it moving in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We’ve adjusted our line-up accordingly and we’ll put the boys on the field as we please, as you know, we’re going to do miracles tomorrow.”
With Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter all set to take on their European rivals, Thomas is the next man in line.
"I put my teammates in that order because I think it carries through the tournament," Bjorn said.
Germany's New Ship Delayed Again
The German Navy’s newest frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace aging Cold War equipment, but it will not be commissioned until next year due to faulty systems and explosively rising costs, local media say.
According to a military spokesman speaking to Die Zeit, the commissioning of the ‘Rhineland-Palatinate’, the first ship of the new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg frigate class, has been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but the ambitious project has been haunted by worrying back-delivery problems.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships ordered by the fleet in 2007 are intended to replace the ageing Bremen-class frigates.
According to the available information, they will be equipped with an effective cannon, missile systems for air and surface defence and cloaking technology, such as technology to reduce radar reflectivity and the detectability of infrared and acoustic signals.
Another important feature of the vessel is its longer service interval – new frigates should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without having to visit their home port.
However, the constant delays mean that state-of-the-art warships — purportedly designed to enhance Germany’s influence in overseas territories— are already obsolete by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet has returned a vessel since its delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media has spoken of essential "software and hardware failures" that make the warship unfit for combat.
The software deficiencies are particularly important because the size of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships’ crew is about 120, which is only half of the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it was found that the vessel is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the fleet's possibilities for subsequent upgrades.
With a capacity of 7 000 tonnes, the Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the price tag of the entire project is also becoming a problem.
The price is said to have risen to a staggering EUR 3.1 billion, compared with the original price of EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the introduction of new frigates have been highlighted by recent warnings that the German navy is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, noted earlier this year that the fleet's usable vessels are "running low".
The problem has grown over time because old ships have been decommissioned but no new ones have been delivered.
He complained that none of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigates could be commissioned.
Environmental group taps into hidden life of bats
A new study in the Scottish Highlands aims to find out how bats use the terrain to hunt for food.
The new study is hoped to shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and to provide guidance in future conservation measures.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, looks at bats and dwarf bats, as well as ear mites and waterwings in the Inverewe Garden, a botanical garden in Wester Ross.
In the study, special storage devices are placed at important points in the area to monitor the activity of bats during the season.
The organisation’s employees and volunteers also carry out mobile measurements using portable observation devices.
The frequencies of the noises, as well as the species in question, are confirmed by expert analysis.
Based on the results, a habitat map and report are created, in which the behaviour of bats can be presented in a picture that follows the scale of the area.
Rob Dewar, the organization’s conservation adviser, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for bats, and how different species exploit them.
This information is useful for planning habitat areas, such as meadows and forest management, taking bats and related species into account.
Bat populations in Scotland and the UK as a whole have declined considerably over the last hundred years.
Construction and civil engineering work threatens the bat’s resting places and habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flypapers and certain chemicals used in building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, due to night-time hunting habits, their ears are more useful for catching prey than their eyes.
Bats use advanced sonar technology to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The National Trust for Scotland is a rural environmental conservation organisation that maintains more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country – and they take bats seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly carry out surveys, checks on resting places and, in some cases, animal rescue operations.
The organisation has even set up Scotland’s first and only bat-only protected area on the grounds of Threave Manor in the Dumfries and Galloway areas, where eight of Scotland’s ten species of bats are found.
According to David Thompson, the area is ideal for bats.
"Threave is very suitable for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings and trees and, overall, a good living environment.
Not everything is known about bats, so our work here and in other areas of the organisation will help us better understand what bats need to be successful."
He stresses the importance of checking buildings for bats before starting any refurbishment work, as the destruction of one resting place for bats could inadvertently kill up to 400 female bats and chicks and destroy an entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and it is forbidden to kill, disturb or destroy their resting places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the Bat Protection Society, encourages the public to participate in the conservation work.
He says, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we don’t yet know how their populations will fare.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the allegations of rape against him as "fake news" and says people want to "advertise themselves" using his name.
Ronaldo’s lawyers have taken action to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker has been charged with raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid the victim $375,000 for his silence, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Ronaldo appeared on Instagram live to his 142 million followers just hours after the allegations were made. The 33-year-old footballer vehemently rejected the allegations and described them as “fake news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they’ve said today is fake news,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner told the camera.
"They just want to advertise themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, it's part of this profession.
I’m a happy man and all is well,” the player continued, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for what they have called "unworthy reporting of privacy concerns," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player is claiming compensation for “mental suffering according to the seriousness of the offense, which is probably the most serious personal rights violation in recent years.”
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly met at a nightclub and entered the player’s room where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo landed on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "99% good guy" but whose "1%" disappointed him.
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that it was mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims to have visited a police station and taken photographs of her injuries at the hospital, but later reached a settlement because she was “terrified by the possibility of revenge” and worried about being “subject to public humiliation.”
The 34-year-old says he is now seeking the annulment of the settlement proceedings because he is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to a deal to transfer to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and moved to Juventus for $100 million.
Brexit: UK 'would regret it forever' end of car manufacturing
Britain would "repent forever" if it lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, Minister of Economic Affairs Greg Clark said.
He added that he was "concerned" by Toyota's UK unit's announcement to temporarily suspend production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby, if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.
"We need a deal," Clark says.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of the border delays would be reflected in job losses if a no-deal Brexit was reached.
The factory in Burnaston, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if the UK abruptly leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will be disrupted,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota’s Burnaston unit.
Other car manufacturers in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears about leaving the European Union and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, has announced that it will shut down its Mini factory for a month after Brexit.
The main concern, according to car manufacturers, concerns supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is run on a timely JOT principle, with parts arriving at the plant every 37 minutes from their suppliers in the UK and the EU, and the cars are made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it could cause disruption at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortages in parts.
Toyota said it would be impossible to maintain a warehouse in Derbyshire for more than 24 hours and production would be halted.
Clark said Theresa May’s EU relations plan was “exactly calibrated to avoid these checks at the border.”
"We want the best possible deal, which is not just a success in the current situation, but an opportunity that we have to take advantage of," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The statements made not only by Toyota but also by other manufacturers show that we absolutely must be able to continue the series of supply chains that have worked very well so far.”
Toyota cannot say how long the plant will be shut down, but warns that additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and works as a union official at the factory, says the concern is growing among members: “In my experience, lost jobs never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We need to present an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, White House says
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s challenging meeting with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may “have to be postponed for another week” due to the turbulent responsibilities surrounding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who in turn investigates Russian meddling in the election, Trump’s aides’ connections to Russia, and any action the president may take to obstruct justice.
For months, there have been rumors in Washington that Trump plans to fire the Assistant Attorney General, which would jeopardize Mueller’s impartiality in the investigation.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of secretly recording conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of firing the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the details of the report.
Rosenstein visited the White House on Monday, and the meeting was said to have been held in connection with Rosenstein's resignation.
However, President Trump was visiting the United Nations in New York at the time, so the date for the meeting was announced as Thursday.
Trump said he would “not prefer” to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because its timing coincided with a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote in the Senate Plenary.
Trump’s press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News’ Sunday program.
Asked about Rosenstein's meeting, Sanders said: "There is no date set for this. It could be next week, this week, it could be postponed for another week due to everything else going on in the Supreme Court at this time.
It remains to be seen, but I always want to keep the press informed."
Some journalists might disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Newscaster Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the reason for the lack of press coverage was for reasons other than their dislike of TV journalists' "attentionism", but said: "I do not deny the fact that they are attention-seeking."
Sanders hinted, however, that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president does more question-and-answer sessions than any president before him,” he says, adding to the evidence unquote: “We’ve checked those numbers.”
“Press conferences are still going to be held,” Sanders said, “but it’s infinitely better if the media has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States than to talk to me.
We try to do this often, and you have seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, and this will replace the press release so you can speak directly to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open events or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Attending a press conference alone is rare.
This week in New York, the President may have pointed out the reason for this, in his unrestrained and at times bizarre appearances to the journalists who gathered there.
Health Minister writes letter to NHS Scotland staff from EU countries on fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health has written a letter to workers in the Scottish healthcare system from EU countries to express their gratitude and hope for staying in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter with less than six months left to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government is already prepared to cover the costs of applications for the "established status" of EU citizens working in specialised public services.
In his letter, Freeman writes as follows: During the summer, the Brexit negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued towards the decisions expected in the autumn.
The UK Government has also stepped up preparations in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
I know these are uncertain times for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate now how much we value the contribution of each of our employees, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare work and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
“Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie to undergo emergency surgery for head injury
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie has been on emergency surgery since the team lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Tennessee journalist Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
“He came to the sideline and simply collapsed into it,” Reed says.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the sideline before placing her on a stretcher and taking her aside for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told WSMV reporter Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been discharged from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "the type/extent of the injury is unknown at this stage" and that the Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a second-year student at Tennessee State University and plays his first season on the team from Illinois after his transfer.
He had five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, and the extra money will be used according to the Conservative Party’s new plans to help the homeless.
The change aims to neutralize Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters
The increase in stamp duty applies to those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom
Finance Ministry expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year – to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce a higher stamp duty rate for foreign buyers when buying property in the UK. The extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters. Corbyn has made promises of more affordable housing and paid attention to the taxation of high-income earners.
The increase in stamp duty will be targeted at people and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money from this will be channelled into government measures to alleviate the plight of the homeless.
The surcharge – which will be added to the current stamp duty in addition to the increases in second and investment dwellings added two years ago – may be as high as 3%.
The Minister of Finance expects the increase to yield up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13% of new buildings in London are bought by non-UK residents, raising prices and hampering first-time home buyers' opportunities in the owner-occupied housing market.
Many affluent areas of the UK – especially its capital – have become ‘ghost cities’ because many foreign property owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed lowering the stamp tax as a way to make it easier for young people to buy their first homes.
He accused major construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land and not building it, and urged Prime Minister May to scrap cheap housing quotas to address Britain’s “shaming housing situation.”
Corbyn has published an eye-catching series of proposals to reform the housing market, including restrictions on rents and an end to “negligent evictions.”
He would also like to give the councils more power in matters related to the construction of new housing.
Last year, I said I was going to dedicate my term as Prime Minister to the British dream – that every generation’s life should be better than its predecessor’s – to restoring it.
This means repairing our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right that people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies abroad, can buy housing as easily as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, owning a home has become a far too far-fetched dream, and the shame of being homeless remains a reality.”
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland's national team'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his “ultimate goal” is to become Scotland’s team manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is excited about the challenge of bringing the northeast corner home team back to its feet. The team is currently in third place in the British Second Division.
Ross moved to the “stadium of lights” this summer after he had relegated St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I made the second team and that’s it,” Ross told BBC: Scotland’s Sportssound.
“As a child, I often watched Scottish games with my father at Hampden, and that’s something that has always pulled me back.
This opportunity will only come if I succeed as the club’s manager.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he was not concerned about stepping into the shoes of his illustrious predecessors in the illustrious club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
"At the moment I'm measuring my own success by whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
Based on the club’s structure and ability, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League,” he says.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I’d probably only consider myself successful if I could get the team back into the Premier League.”
Ross has only been a manager for three years: first as Deputy Director of Dumbarton and then for 15 months in the Heats coaching team.
He then helped Alloa rise from the series three crash games and helped St Mirren to become champions the following season.
Ross says he feels better than ever during his career with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“I was probably at a real crossroads with my career,” he recalls the time when he took over the leadership of Alloa.
“I really thought I was better suited as a manager than a player.
It sounds strange, because I played well, I made a fair amount of money and I got to enjoy some relatively big successes.
However, playing can be tough.
The player has to deal with a lot of things every week.
I’m still going through the same things, like the stress and the pressure of the job, but leading a team feels like the right thing to do.
I always wanted to lead the team and now I do it for a living and I feel better in my own body than I have ever felt in my adult life."
The full interview will be broadcasted on Sportssound on Sunday 30.9, on Radio Scotland at 12:00 and 13:00 BST

The summer heat wave has given a boost to pubs struggling with Britain’s difficulties, but at the same time has added to the pressure on restaurant chains.
According to statistics, the sales of pub and bar chains increased by 2.7% during July, but the revenue of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, business consultant at CGA, who compiled the figures, says: “Continuous sunny weather and England’s longer-than-expected participation in the FIFA World Cup meant July was similar to June, with pub sales up 2.8%, while for restaurants the month was even worse.
The decline in restaurant sales of 1.8% in June only worsened in July.
Beverage-focused pubs and bars performed best, with their like-for-like sales growing more than the decline in restaurant sales.
Food-oriented pubs also suffer from the heat, but less dramatically than restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to get out of drinking in their mind.
Company-run pubs and bars saw a 6.6% increase in sales over the month, while food sales were down 3%."
Paul Newman of RSM, a consulting company providing leisure and hospitality services, says: “The results continue a trend that has been ongoing since late April.
Weather and major social or sporting events are still the main factors affecting sales in the out-of-home dining market.
It is no surprise that restaurant chains continue to struggle, even though the 4.8% annual sales decline is aggravating, especially at a time when the industry is struggling with cost pressures.
The long hot summer couldn’t have gotten any worse for food-focused operators, and only time will tell if the milder temperatures in August will bring the industry a much-needed respite.
The combined sales growth of pubs and restaurants, including new restaurants, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the creation of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker is the UK’s barometer for pub, bar and restaurant sales, collecting and analysing earnings data from 47 industry groups with a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is considered a reliable indicator of the sector.
One-fifth of children hide social media accounts from their parents
One-fifth of children — some as young as 11 years old — hide social media accounts from their parents and teachers, study finds
Study of 20,000 secondary school students reveals growing ‘Instagram fake accounts’ phenomenon
The news raised concerns that accounts could be used to share sexually explicit content
20% of students say they have a ‘main account’ that is shown to parents
One-fifth of children — some as young as 11 years old — create social media accounts that they encrypt from adults.
A study of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the rapidly growing existence of ‘Instagram fake accounts’, which refers to the Instagram site for sharing images.
The news has raised fears that sexual content may be published in accounts.
Twenty percent of the students said they kept a cleaned up ‘main account’ for parents to show while they used other, private accounts.
A mother found messages written by a teenager wishing to be raped after she stumbled across a secret site of her 13-year-old daughter.
A study commissioned by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC found that 40 per cent of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 had two separate profiles, and half of the respondents admitted to having secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: “It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”

Eilidh Doyle has been elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish Athletes' Board and attends the Governing Body's annual general assembly.
Doyle is Scotland’s most award-winning athlete, with Ian Beattie, chairman of the board, describing the term as a “great opportunity for sports decision-makers to benefit from the wide-ranging, international-level experience the athlete has accumulated over the past decade.”
“Eilidh is hugely respected among athletes in Scotland, the UK and internationally. I am sure Scottish athletes would benefit enormously from his appointment to the government,” Beattie says.
Doyle says: “I look forward to my role as a voice for athletes and hope I can be useful and help steer Scottish sport in the right direction.”
The American athlete who won four Olympic gold medals in the 200-meter and 400-meter event at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, and who is now a regular commentator on the BBC, lost his walking ability as a result of a transient cerebral vascular disorder.
He tweeted, “A month ago I had a stroke.”
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time will tell if I will recover and in what condition.
This has been exhausting work, but I have fully recovered, learned to walk again and now I am already training agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!”
Related: Mothers to Cows Share Opinions Online
An ad that equates breastfeeding mothers of a breast pump company with dairy cows has shared opinions on the Internet.
Consumer technology maker Elvie has launched a product called “the world’s first silent and wearable breast pump” with a tongue-in-cheek, music-video-style commercial that describes the freedom that the new pump will bring to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real-life mothers dance in a grass-filled barn with songs such as "Yes, I milk myself, but I can't see the tail" and "In case you didn't notice, they're not udders, they're boobs."
The chorus continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk my ladies."
However, an advertisement posted on the company’s Facebook page sparked a discussion online.
The video, which has attracted 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, has sparked controversy among viewers, with many saying it is a mockery of the dairy industry’s daily ‘horror’.
"Using cows to advertise this product was a very bad decision.
They have to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them soon after birth,” one commentator wrote.

Another viewer commented, "Obviously, it's traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump to mothers who get to keep their babies?”
A third commenter added: "A completely reality-driven advertisement."
The ad also got defenders: a woman admitted that the ad was "fun".
"I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one of those if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
This is a brilliant product," reads one of the comments.
Another viewer commented: “This is a fun ad aimed at moms who pump (often at work or in the toilet) and ‘feel like cows’.
The aim of the advertisement is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the ad, the women reveal that they have danced in discreet pumps stuffed into their bras.
The concept of the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who use a breast pump feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires and hoses and fits discreetly inside the nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go outside while pumping.
Ana Balarin, co-owner and artistic director of the advertising agency Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is a revolutionary product that deserved a bold and provocative entry into the market.
By juxtaposing nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to bring all the challenges of using a breast pump into the spotlight, bringing out the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump brings in an entertaining and relatable way.”
The Elvie pump has made headlines before.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the catwalk wearing designer Marta Jakubowski’s outfit using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Moved to Texas Border Camp in Silence
The number of migrant children apprehended has increased sharply despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to place children in foster families.
Most foster families have traditionally been composed of undocumented immigrants, and registering as a foster family may jeopardise their own stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential foster families and other adult members of the household would have to give their fingerprints, and that this information would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a high-level immigration and customs official, testified last week in Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for foster homes for underage immigrants.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Nearly 80% of the people who are either members of foster families or members of their households are in the country illegally, and a large part of them are criminal foreigners.
So we will continue to search for these people," Albence said.
In an effort to speed up the handling of children’s cases, authorities have introduced new rules that, in some cases, require the court to deal with the case within one month of the arrest, instead of the 60-day time limit previously in place, the reception centre’s staff say.
Many prefer to appear by videoconference rather than in person before a migrant court.
Those who are not considered to be eligible for aid will be expelled immediately.
According to reports published by reception centre staff and the scheme in recent months, the amount of time children spend in prison has an impact on whether children start to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts.
According to the lawyers, the concern is especially pronounced in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs of despair of the child may go unnoticed due to the large size of the institution.
They add that moving children to tent cities without giving them enough time to prepare themselves emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause trauma, and that many children are already suffering from trauma.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish “occupiers” to leave immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return to their homes after the country has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who also replaces the prime minister, said foreign troops were in the country illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "with them we will act accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died in 2011 and since, and where millions of people have been forced to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue its “holy struggle until the whole of Syria is cleansed” of both terrorist organizations and “illegal foreign troops.”
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops stationed in Syria, where they are mainly training and mentoring the Kurds and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has deployed a force of more than 1,000 soldiers in a country torn apart by fighting.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said conditions were good for a return and accused “some Westerners” of “spreading irrational fears” that encourage refugees to stay out of the country.
"We have invited the international community and aid agencies to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be given to Syria until a political agreement has been reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone at the rebels’ last base in Idlib has created an opportunity for political discussions.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on an area of three million people.
Moualem has, however, stressed that the agreement has "clear time limits" and expressed the wish that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Nusra front linked to al-Qaeda, "who will be destroyed".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new government and opposition committee to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem laid down conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying its work should be limited to “revising the articles of the current constitution” and warned against meddling in the matter.
Why Trump Will Be Elected for a Second Term
According to this logic, President Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, the impeachment and scandal ends his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic presidential decision ever!”
So far, there have been no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN’s best-time viewing figures have more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow Show has reached a cable TV peak of 3.5 million viewers as the main news night.
“This is a flare that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, chief executive of ABC’s Designated Survivor program, in a statement.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
Scovell asked why.
The driver replied, “Because he makes me laugh,” Scovell says.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, news from Washington can determine what happens in Roe vs. Wade, whether members of immigrant families get to each other, and how the global economy is doing.
Indifference is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond the responsibilities of the conscious citizen to look at a six-hour panel of experts debating the use of Bob Woodward’s source data for the book Fear, Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-skinned pilot jacket (according to the Washington Post, “a stout piece of clothing out of arrogance”), and the consequences of President Stormy Daniels’ blunt descriptions of Trump’s anatomy.
I will never see Super Mario the same way again.
“What he’s doing feels like a reality TV show, because in part it’s about him giving the audience something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the Pawn Shop series, about the changing characters on Trump’s show and the daily changing plot twists (NFL dispute, Kim Jong Un’s praise).
You can't miss a single episode, or you'll fall off the wagon.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a lovely sunny day at his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he couldn’t go out because he was watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not disengage from the program in which Brett Kavanaugh was before the Senate Judiciary Committee and it was the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy programs and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss said.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Money flowing from the outside for a tough midterm battle
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th constituency has been hit with a real cash flow, with the reshuffle of congressional districts forcing the two already elected candidates to fight for one seat.
This recently re-arranged Pittsburgh constituency is a battle call for Democratic Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another constituency in last spring's special election.
Lamb is in competition with another elected candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th constituency, which overlaps with the new 17th constituency.
The zoning was reversed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old constituency had unconstitutionally favored Republicans.
Competition in the new 17th constituency has sparked an economic struggle in the main party finance departments of the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name came to light in Pennsylvania after the widely watched special election of the 18th Pennsylvania Congressional District in March.
The place had been owned by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the region by 20 percent.
Political commentators have given the Democrats a slight head start.
U.S. Plans to Punish El Salvador for Supporting China, but Backs Down
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already noted the situation in Beijing and the mild reaction of Washington.
President Trump had a warm-hearted meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization’s management team.
U.S. State Department officials decided to recall U.S. diplomatic leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama on the basis of “quiet policies that say Taiwan will no longer be recognized,” Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, only El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, was considered for sanctions, including drug control, development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit a Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings progressed, the authorities in North and Central America postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity, a similar gathering last year seen as a step in efforts to prevent migrants from seeking entry into the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior government officials made it clear that they wanted the meeting to proceed and this effectively put an end to speculation about a possible punishment for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now expected to give the mid-October meeting some indication of the administration's importance to the meeting, the diplomats said.
The three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further nasty messages or punishments from Washington.
A Bolton White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the conversation with three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal matters anonymously.
Their report was corroborated by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under anonymity.
History teaches
The next inevitable step may be the report by special counsel Robert Mueller on a possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, which is now being found in very strong evidence in public documents.
Mueller is also reportedly conducting an investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia when it interfered in US elections.
If power shifts in Congress, President Trump will find himself held accountable just as he prepares to go back to his constituents and face possible condemnation by his peers.
There’s a lot of ifs and buts about this, and I’m not saying that President Trump’s defeat is inevitable – any more than the defeat of people like him in Europe.
We have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic, and those decisions will determine how long this struggle will last.
In 1938, the German authorities would have been ready to overthrow Hitler if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history twists into such turning points, where the inevitable march forward of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing many of these turning points.
What do we do if President Trump sacks Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for investigating the Mueller case?
Rosenstein has been embellished ever since it became known that he had proposed a secret recording of the president’s speech and wondered if the president would be unable to carry out his duties.
Rosenstein said the Times report was wrong.
“How will we react if the recently-requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanugh’s actions is not complete or fair – or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And, above all, are we going to vote for a Congress that holds President Trump accountable in the midterms?
If we fail in these struggles, our democracy will face a long and dark winter.
But I believe in our success because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once filled my diplomatic home.
He survived, emigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to light the Sabbath candles on that swastika-decorated table.
How can I be anything but optimistic about the future?”

Graham Dorrans optimistic about Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will face Rapid Vienna at home on Thursday, knowing that after a draw against Villarreal earlier that month in Spain, a victory over the Austrians would give the team a strong position to qualify for the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from getting on the pitch this season before Villarreal's 2-2 game, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for better results.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old said.
“We went into the game with the expectation that we could get something and we brought a point with us.
Maybe we could have won at the end, but all in all, the draw is probably a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half and we got up to speed in the second half and we were better.
There will be another big night in the Europa League on Thursday.
I hope we get three points, but it’s going to be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but I believe that with the support of this team we can give everything and achieve a positive result.
Last year was really tough when it comes to my injuries and changes in the team, but now it feels good.
The line-up is good and the boys are enjoying themselves; the training is going well.
Hopefully we can now push hard, put the past season behind us and be successful."
Women’s Fear of Retirement Deprives Women of Sleep
Although the study participants had a clear vision of how they wanted to take care of themselves, few had spoken to their loved ones about it.
About half of the participants in the nationwide study said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10% of respondents said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t bring it up,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Life Insurance Company.
Start like this.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can’t prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell them your wishes in time.
Talk to a professional and your family about where and how to get help, as these questions are an important cost-determining factor.
Involve a financial advisor in the discussion: advice can also help you figure out a way to cover these costs.
Financing options for long-term care can be, for example, traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance applied to cover these costs, or self-costing insurance, if you can afford it.
Prepare legal documents: prevent legal disputes.
Get a health care representative on-site so you can appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals follow your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate with them.
You should also consider drawing up a power of attorney to manage your financial affairs.
It allows you to set up a trusted person to take care of financial decisions for you and ensure that your invoices are paid if you are unable to take care of them yourself.
Also remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is on his way to the hospital because of a medical emergency.
Would you be able to answer questions about her medication and allergies?
Write such information in the plan so that you are prepared for the situation.

Category: Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities that the number of victims is expected to increase.
Since communications with the area have been cut off, rescue officials have not received any information on the north side of Please from the area of the municipality of Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the magnitude 7.5 quake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated since the disaster.
Key information about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, located at the narrow end of a bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population estimated at 379,800 in 2017.
An earthquake and tsunami struck in the middle of the city’s 40th anniversary celebrations.
The municipality of Donggala extends more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) into the island of Sulawesi on the northwestern coastal line.
The municipality of Donggala is an administrative region of the province, with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main economic activities in the central Sulawesi province, and especially in the coastal area of Donggala, are fishing and agriculture.
Nickel mining is also important, but it is concentrated in Morowal on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency, Indonesia has been hit by tsunamis in the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and is often affected by earthquakes.
Some of the most serious earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake in northern Sumatra off the west coast of Aceh province in Indonesia caused a tsunami on December 26 that struck 14 states and killed 226,000 people off the coast of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims were in the Aceh region.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populated island, causing a tsunami that struck the south coast of the island, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands in Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake strikes Aceh’s Pidie Jaya region, causing devastation and panic as people remember the massive damage caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died when the buildings collapsed.
2018: Powerful earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily isolated thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice-presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to an Alaskan police report on Saturday, Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, as well as obstruction of a domestic violence report and opposition in connection with the arrest.
According to the police report, Palin took the phone from his female companion when she tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is being held in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Prison and has been ordered to pay $500 in bail, TV channel KTUU reports.
According to the report, Palin arrived in court on Saturday and replied that he was "definitely innocent".
Palin is charged with three class A offenses, which means he can get up to a year in jail and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B offense, punishable by a day's imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father Todd Palin.
At the time, Palin’s mother called the police and reported the assault.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, Palin was charged with domestic violence involving possession of a weapon under the influence of narcotics.
Palin's girlfriend accused Palin of punching her in the face.
Veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for associating her son’s violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder due to service rendered in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have been killed since the earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications connections have been cut and the number of victims is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi on the northeast side of Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta.
Social media is circulating videos of the moment of the quake.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in Pura when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are considering imposing a rare death penalty on a NYC terrorist attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the eight-person terrorist attack in New York City, a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was accused of using a Home Depot rental car in his October attack on the West Side Highway, where he hit pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a statement related to an application for the death penalty in the Southern District of New York, the death penalty is possible if prosecutors can prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight of his victims and caused "deliberately" serious physical injuries.
According to the court document, it is possible to carry out a death sentence on both of these charges.
Weeks after the attack, a federal court filed a 22-point indictment against Saipov, which included charges of eight murders to aid a terrorist organization. Federal prosecutors typically use this criminal title in cases involving organized crime. In addition, the charges included charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles,
The attack required "considerable planning and preparation," prosecutors said, describing the manner in which Saipov carried out his actions as "terrible, cruel and shameful."
"Sayfullo Habibullavic Saipov caused injury, harm and loss to the families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been a decade since the last time a court in the Southern District of New York passed the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murders of two drug traffickers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in New York in 1953 in a federal case, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed for conspiracy to spy on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed no signs of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators what he had done felt good, police said.
Saipov said he was inspired to strike after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said Saipov also wanted an ISIS ticket to his hospital room.
He was charged with 22 counts of innocence.
David Patton, one of the federal public defense attorneys representing Saipov, said the defense was "naturally disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty rather than recognition and life imprisonment without the possibility of release is a solution that will only prolong the trauma these events cause to those concerned," Patton said.
Saipov’s defense had previously requested that he not be required to carry the death penalty.
The Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be held accountable in the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage has vowed to “mobilize an army of citizens” against the Conservatives.
The former UKIP leader said politicians must feel the pressure of Eurosceptics - when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested she lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told marchers in Birmingham that Britain "would already be out" if Farage were Brexit secretary.
But May faces a challenge as she tries to reconcile her deeply divided ranks, underlined by pro-remaining conservatives who joined a separate anti-Brexit rally in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep his Chequers compromise proposal afloat under pressure from Brexit supporters and opponents, as well as the EU.
Supporters urged him to continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the setback - and to force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to make a choice between his proposal and chaos.
At the Leave Means Leave event in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to "throw away the Chequers proposal".
He suggested that Mr Farage should be involved and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we'd be out by now," he said.
A Wellingborough MP added: "I am in favour of Brexit, but we have to get rid of the Chequers proposal."
He voiced his opposition to the EU, saying: "We did not wage world wars to end up as subjects.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed the idea that public opinion would have changed after the 2016 vote: “That the British would have changed their minds and would like to stay is a completely false claim.”
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers proposal is not supported by the people, the opposition will not vote in favour of it, nor will it be supported by party members or by activists who really take to the streets and are responsible for our success in general.
Give up the Chequers proposal and start listening."
In a message to May, he added: "Prime Ministers can keep their jobs if they keep their promises."
Farage said politicians would have to feel pressure if they were to reverse the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
This is about trust between the people and the political class," he said.
“They’re trying to water down Brexit and we’re here today to tell them that we don’t accept it.”
Speaking to an enthusiastic crowd, he added, “I want politicians who are about to reverse Brexit to feel pressured by you.”
“We are going to mobilize the army of citizens of this country that gave us the victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until Britain is once again an independent, self-governing and proud nation.”
In the meantime, supporters of staying marched through Birmingham before the two-hour event in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved "Tories Against Brexit" signs. The group was founded this weekend.
Labour’s Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they had with the party app at the start of the meeting.
"These are the people who say they can get IT systems up and running and all the technology for Canada plus plus and frictionless border functions for free trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at City Hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, known for his repeated criticisms of President Trump, will face reelection in November to Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
Warren is likely to run against Trump in the 2020 election.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was his 36th town hall meeting with voters since the start of Trump’s term.
A participant asked Warren if he was running for president.
Warren responded that now is the time for “women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman in the highest place.”
Arrested in LSU Sims shooting
Louisiana Baton Rouge police said Saturday they arrested a suspect in the Friday shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. at an ET briefing.
Police released a video of Friday’s shooting and asked for help identifying the man in it.
Sims, 20, was shot near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters Saturday through the 247 Sports Network.
Wayde defended his friend when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted to being present, holding a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson did not resist arrest and was taken to the East Baton Rouge Police Station.
He played 32 games and 10 starts last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world championship after team arrangements offer him victory over Sebastian Vettel
When Valtteri Bottas overtook Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became apparent that Mercedes’ team arrangements played an important role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the pole and left Hamilton almost on his own as he defended his place in the first two rounds, calling Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the pits first and left Hamilton to drive the team with the tail, which should have solved the situation.
Mercedes went to the pits later and came back after Vettel, but Hamilton passed after some contact and the Ferrari driver reluctantly moved out of the line, giving up defending his position after only two thirds of the turn.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started in the back row and was seventh after the first round.
After that, he was in the lead for a large part of the race, prolonging the tyre change, aiming for a quick finish and taking fourth place from Kimi Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen.
In the end, he came to the pits in the 44th round, but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, with Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen taking fourth place.
This was a difficult day, as Valtteri performed brilliantly throughout the weekend and was a true gentleman when he let me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job with a double win," Hamilton said.
Very bad body language
On Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein for not leaking a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at an event in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but stated that what was going on in the Senate was evidence of people’s “wickedness, malice and dishonesty.”
“The one possible thing, the wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate for the last few days, seeing anger, people who are angry, mean, mean and dishonest,” he said.
“When we see publications and leaked things and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it.'
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak this information?
Do you remember his answer... did you leak the document – oh, what?
Oh, no, no.
I didn't leak.'
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did we...No, we didn't leak," he added, mocking the senator.
Feinstein received a letter in July describing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and the letter was leaked to the public in September, but Feinstein denied the leak occurred from his office.
“I didn’t hide Professor Ford’s accusations, and I didn’t leak his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential according to his wishes."
But his ban did not suit the president, who commented on the matter at Saturday’s ceremony: “I’ll tell you, that was very bad body language.
Maybe he didn’t do it, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court nominee, whom three women have accused of sexual harassment, and suggested the Democrats were using the allegations to their advantage.
"They are determined to get back into power by any means necessary.
They don't care who they hurt or who they have to walk over to get to power and control," Mediaite reported the president as saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars claimed compensation for their loss to the Belfast Giants in Friday’s Elite League match by winning 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had an early lead thanks to the two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team back to the levels before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald's two goals secured the win.
This was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
The teams faced off for the fourth time in the season after the Giants had won three previous games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on Kendall McFaull's pitch. David Rutherford pitched when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the sizzling opening sequence, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt passed the Cownies' handicap at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead in the first set break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first set.
The home team gathered their ranks and Bouchard equalized again with a power goal in time of 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up and Nielsen scored the first goal for Dundee at the end of the second period, and secured the win with his team's fifth goal in the middle of the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes at home on Friday.
The pilot was killed while making sure that hundreds of passengers on the plane escaped the earthquake.
In Indonesia, the air traffic controller has become a hero since his death, ensuring that an aircraft carrying hundreds of passengers got safely into the air.
More than 800 people have been killed and several more are missing after a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Strong aftershocks are hitting the area and several people have been trapped in the material in the city of Pau.
Although his colleagues fled at the risk of their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung did not leave his job in the wildly swaying air traffic control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed put and made sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was currently on the runway, was safely taken off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower, which he thought was collapsing.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said Agung's decision could save hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
A helicopter was being prepared from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter could make it back.
"This news breaks our hearts," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of victims will rise to thousands, as the disaster authorities in the country have declared that the links with the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong are inadequate.
"The number of victims is expected to continue to rise as several bodies are buried in the rubble and many people have not been reached," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo said in a statement.
Waves of up to six metres in length have destroyed the Puna, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and cargo planes bring aid and equipment to the area.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old housewife, told Sky News: #Ambulances are bringing bodies all the time.
There is a shortage of clean water.
Mini-markets are being robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said in an interview with CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know what awaits us.
It’s a tragedy, but it could be even worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Indonesia on Sunday and said in a speech to the country’s armed forces: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, more than 550 people were killed in earthquakes in Lombok, Indonesia.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugin says one person is missing after plane crashes into lagoon
Representatives of the airline of the plane that crashed into the lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now say one person is missing, even though, according to a previous report, all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated from the safely sinking plane.
Air Niugin said it has not been able to locate a single male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was trying to find the man in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and accident investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions about additional information about the missing passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane struck the water trying to land at Chuuk Airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six people were hospitalized on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact course of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have both reported that the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crashed over the runway.
An American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane landed at a very low altitude.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
According to Jaynes, the passengers were able to wade in the sinking plane in waist-deep water to emergency exits.
He said the crew panicked and screamed, and that he himself suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who were repairing a nearby quay took part in the rescue by carrying people ashore in a rubber boat before the plane sank in water some 100 feet (30 m) deep.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in airline crashes in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but Air Niugini has not been involved in the crash.
An analyst presents a timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution concluded a retrial in which the man was accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert witness in data analytics.
He described to the jury how he had used the information stored in his cell phone to gather together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the victim’s death.
Rowlett said she had received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis had been involved with Chambers the night he died, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the information showed that Tellis' cell phone was at Chambers's house at the same time Tellis claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, Sanford was questioned by police.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford replied that Tellis was "lying because my car was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
According to the phone records, they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett noted that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, phone calls, and contacts from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense’s closing remarks are scheduled to begin Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to proceed to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is Hip Hop?
The hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perceptions of the genre by making music that is full of positive messages.
According to the Bristol-based band The High Breed, hip hop has moved away from the original, whose messages were related to politics and social problems.
They want to go back to the roots of hip hop and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have witnessed the resurgence of Great Britain with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Yet another black man?
New York nanny sues couple over racist text message
A New York nanny sues the couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a text from the child’s mother complaining that she is “another black person.”
The couple denies being racist and equates the challenge with “blackmail.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed regret when the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, arrived at work on her first day of work in 2016 and it dawned on her that she was black.
"EIIIII, AGAIN DARK," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Then she sent a message to Giselle Maurice instead of her husband, twice.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman had fired Maurice, announcing that his former African-American nanny had done a bad job and was this time expecting a Filipino.
Maurice was paid for one of his days at work and was sent home in a taxi.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for a divorce settlement and wants $350 a day for the six months he was originally hired to live and work in the family, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that you can’t do that,” he told The Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have responded to the racist allegations, saying that the termination of Maurice’s employment was a justified solution because they could not trust him for insulting him.
"My wife sent him something he wasn't supposed to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you leave your child with someone you’ve been unkind to, even if only by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Really?"
Plasco equated the challenge with blackmail and said his wife had had the baby two months earlier and was “in a very difficult situation.”
"Will you start chasing someone in a situation like this?
That’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
While the trial is still going on, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, outraging their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington’s publishers were afraid that the audience would not identify with the talking bear
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was approved, says of the letter: “It’s hard to empathize with the person who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It is amusing now that Paddington's immense popularity is known."
Noting that his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before devoting himself to writing children's books about the adventures of the toy bear, was optimistic about the rejection of his book, Jankel added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books felt bittersweet because his father had died the previous year.
He described Paddington as "a very important member of the family" and said his father was quietly proud of the success it had achieved.
"He was a pretty quiet guy, and not a flamboyant guy at all," she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost a child's achievement to him, one of which you are proud, though it is not really your own doing.
I think he felt Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation, he always gave the credit to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter.
Her daughter had been rushed after the plane landed at the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called a few times and said it was really bad that he wasn’t expected to make it,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
Then Nad called and said that my daughter would die in a couple of minutes and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
So I did.
I said, "I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm with you."
The drugs that doctors used to keep his heart running gradually disappeared from his system.
He had died a little earlier, and now it all went out.
I could just sit there knowing it was all coming to an end.
I could not scream or cry because I was in a situation where there were families and other people around me.
I had to hold myself together.”
Finally, grieving for the loss of her daughter, Ednan-Laperouse boarded the plane along with other passengers — who knew nothing of the ordeal she was going through.
"Nobody knew," he said.
"I kept my head down and the tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt tremendous compassion for Nadia.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved my daughter.”
Mourning women send cards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones are working to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send cards with encouraging messages and a phone number for support.
Davis' son, Tyler, suffered from depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to have to experience the emotions that I feel every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, said his son was a promising cook with a contagious grin.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said his smile would light up the whole room."
However, he quit his job before his death because he felt he was in the “darkness.”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother found his brother, who had taken his own life.
Davis says he's always afraid of the after-effects.
Davis created the cards to "tell people that there are people you can go talk to, even if it's a friend.
“Don’t be silent, you have to talk.”
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies for many years, and he lost his partner Mark after 15 years together shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me he was upset or depressed or anything like that," Humphreys said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
When the kids opened their presents, he didn't make eye contact or anything like that."
He says Mark’s death was a severe trauma for them, but they have to move on: “It’s tearing the family apart.
It's tearing us apart.
But we just have to keep going and keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future at stake as FBI opens investigation
"I thought that if we could really achieve what he wanted - an investigation limited in time and scope - we could perhaps achieve a little unity," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "disintegrate" into a stalemate caused by supporters.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want an FBI investigation?
Reluctance is about timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans’ success is poor as expected, their efforts to get the man they want elected to the country’s Supreme Court will be hampered.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone and called the senators to lobby for their support of Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House under Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, is holding a vote.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh could get at least 50 votes, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to blow the game away and confirm his election to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of defectors falls during Kim regime
South Korean lawmakers say the number of North Korean defectors has decreased since Kim Jong Un took power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug quoted the South Korean Ministry of Unification as saying there were 1,127 defections last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
According to Park, the key factors have been the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in the prices of human traffickers.
There has been no public comment on Pyongyang.
The majority of North Korean defectors will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
More than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most flee via China because it has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and most often returns them by force.
Technically speaking, relations between North Korea and South Korea, which are still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, and the talks focused on stalled negotiations over the destruction of nuclear weapons.
This followed a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore and generally agreed to work towards denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of being “stuck” in sanctions after the meeting.
"Without any confidence on the part of the United States, our national security will not be reliable and under no circumstances will we begin to unilaterally dismantle our armaments first," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and 'inappropriate' to act in Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was temporarily unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if she had behaved like that, she would be called 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her own reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh vehemently denied allegations that she sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was emotional, and at times he almost screamed and lost the ability to speak when he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned Democratic members of the committee without calling the accusations against him “a grotesque and systematic persecution of a person” perpetrated by liberals outraged by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential defeat.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not capable of acting in the Supreme Court because it showed him to be biased against Democrats.
“I think he made himself incompetent with his statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats,” Pelosi said.
When asked if he would press charges against Kavanaugh, Pelosi wondered if Kavanaugh's election would be confirmed and if the Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“Let’s just say, if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not qualified not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court he’s currently working for,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving on the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible orders regarding health care reform or the Roe v. Wade case, as Kavanaugh is known as a conservative law enforcement officer.
In the hearings surrounding his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court rulings.
"This is not the right time for a hysterical and partisan person to be elected to the court and for us to be expected to say, 'That's great,'" Pelosi said.
Women have to survive everything.
It is a legitimate speech, with months and years of rage, and he cannot hold it without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual at all, do you?"
She continued: "I was helped immensely by a woman who was in a position of leadership somewhere, who told me that she cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a way of saying to her interlocutor in a situation where she got angry and started crying: 'You might think I'm sad now because I'm crying.
I'm really angry."
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was genius."
Tears are justified as an outlet for rage, even though they are usually fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most memorable memories of my early job in a male-dominated office is once I cried speechlessly in a rage, and an older woman — a cold-eyed supervisor I had always been a little afraid of — grabbed me by the neck and dragged me down the stairs.
“Don’t ever let them see you cry,” he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you’re sad, and then they’re happy because they upset you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
When Hart was caught in 1987 in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and was thrown out of the race, Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason why he wouldn't run for president himself.
“It wasn’t a very well-thought-out decision,” he said, laughing at me 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates and one was the least needed.
Someone called the situation ‘The Snowmen and the Seven Dwarfs.’”
Since the campaign time was already over, he was behind on his fundraising and so he announced that he would not go to the race unless he was able to raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
It dawned on him that some of his supporters, who gave the male candidates a thousand dollars, gave him only 250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” he thought.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not start an official campaign, he was overwhelmed by his emotions - his gratitude for his supporters, his frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds for electoral work for voters and delegates, and his hatred of sexism - that he was unable to speak.
"You'd think I'd have a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the reaction from the press.
“You could have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking that my gravestone would be hacked to make a sure obituary.
“He was crying.”
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The start of the U.S.-China trade war was deafening, and while the battle is far from over, the split between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued a first warning earlier this year by imposing import taxes on China’s main exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of imported goods, effectively taxing half of all imports from China to the US.
Beijing has retaliated every time, most recently by imposing tariffs of between 5% and 10% on US imports worth USD 60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States with an eye for an eye, and it does not appear that the world’s second-largest economic power is slacking off even for a moment.
In order to get Washington to back down, one would have to give in to its own demands, but public bowing to the United States would be far too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the US trade war could have a positive impact on China in the long term by reducing dependence between countries.
“A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for a downward spiral in the economy of either country, and this is actually a more dangerous possibility than bystanders have realized so far,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-based research assistant at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria's foreign minister says the country is "ready" for refugees to return
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of the refugees and calls for help in rebuilding the country after more than seven years of devastating war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country would improve.
"The situation is now more stable and secure thanks to developments in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to repair the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
The conditions now allow refugees to return voluntarily to the country from which they were forced to leave because of terrorism and the one-sided economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be grateful for assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional aid or assistance from states that supported the rebels.
European team confirms Ryder Cup win in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the U.S. team in 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row in Europe, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team kept the crown when its Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn's team scored the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, a star player from the United States, had difficulties almost throughout the tournament and hit the water with his kickoff shot on the 16th hole of the par-3 course, giving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Molinari of Italy excelled in all rounds and became one of only four players to score 5-0-0 since the tournament started in its current form in 1979.
Jordan Spieth of America was eliminated with a score of 5&4 against Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen of Denmark.
World top player Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to England’s Ian Poulter, who could now play his last Ryder Cup.
Eight golf veterans of the Ryder Cup, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most-winning European at the tournament with a total of 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a rough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am so happy to have this win.
It’s about the team and I’m glad I was able to help,” said Garcia, who was moved by the victory of the European team.
He passes the torch to his compatriot Jon Rahm, who won the US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in Sunday’s individual races.
"I feel immense pride in winning Tiger Woods and growing up admiring him," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds the Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
Odd statistics of one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 big wins and is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled to find a way through the entire weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a high level of play throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the U.S. team said after the failure of the show: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
We put pressure on the European team at this morning's games.
We fought back.
Honor to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'm working with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're moving on.
These 12 guys are great and I'm proud to be their captain.
I gotta get my hat on.
We met our winner.”
Situation of red tide algal blooms: concentrations fall in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
According to the latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, there is a general decline in algae in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, more dispersed algal areas are reported in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which may indicate a decrease in concentrations.
Red tide algae blooms along the coast for about 130 miles from Pinellas to the southern counties of Lee.
Ferries can be spotted ten miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but there are fewer of them than there were last week.
Red tide algal blooms have also been observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations were reported off the coast of Pinellas County in the past week, concentrations ranged from low to high along the coasts of Hillsborough County, from background concentrations to high concentrations in the counties of Manatee and Sarasota, from background concentrations to moderate concentrations in Charlotte County, and from background concentrations to high concentrations in the counties of Lee District and Collier County.
Respiratory symptoms are still reported in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier areas.
Over the past week, there have been no reports of respiratory symptoms in the northwest of Florida.
