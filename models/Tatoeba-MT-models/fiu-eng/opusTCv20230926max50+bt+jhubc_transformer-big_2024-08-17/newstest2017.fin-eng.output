28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping mall this week.
However, the victim’s brother says he doesn’t know anyone who wanted to hurt him, and says, “His affairs were finally going well.”
The body, which was found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning, was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco man Frank Galicia, according to the San Francisco County Coroner’s Office.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as a homicide and that an investigation is ongoing.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC’s KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a line cook in Boston, had gotten his dream job as a line cook at the San Francisco-based restaurant Sons & Daughters six months ago.
A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were “dismayed and appalled” by his death.
“We have a small team that works like a close-knit family, and he will be greatly missed,” the representative said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank’s family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank initially stayed in hostels, but that recently "his business was finally going well".
"He found an apartment and was seeing a girl," Louis Galicia told the KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn’t know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was kind and had a big heart.
His way of feeling connected to the family was to make food for us, to make dinner,” said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any disputes.
He was a brother who drifted with the stream.
“In a world where so many things are wrong, he was an uncut diamond that shone brighter every day,” she said.
Anyone with information is advised to call the San Francisco Police Department hotline at 415-575-4444.
Medical interns on strike: Demands for new industrial action measures
Representatives of interns have asked their unions to approve new industrial action measures in their dispute over the new agreement.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) calls on the whole Council to support new industrial action measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the deal.
In July, interns and medical students voted to reject a contract with the BMA.
58% of the members who voted rejected it.
In a letter to members via Twitter on Thursday night, JDC president Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "absolutely silent" on the issues that, she said, led to the rejection of the deal.
He said: "In this light, the JDC government has voted to completely reject the proposed new agreement and to insist on formal renegotiations of all your concerns."
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC government has today formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council to authorize a gradually advancing and expanding industrial action program beginning early September.
As a result of the dispute, medical interns have participated in six strikes this year, including the first complete stoppage of work in the history of the NHS health care system.
The head of the BMA’s medical interns, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after voting to reject the terms of the contract negotiated by the BMA.
He had told BMA members at meetings before the vote of 54,000 interns and students that the agreement was good and should be approved.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the agreement would be imposed on doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: a coalition of outsiders?
An act that ended in a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare an official end to the eight-month-long struggle over words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the gilded hall of the St Petersburg Palace, I got the clear impression that Ankara wanted more of this reconciliation.
Yes, they shook hands at the event.
But Putin’s smile looked forced, and he didn’t show much warmth, even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, kept talking about his “dear friend” Putin – five times, according to a report.
I lost count.
He also vowed that relations with Russia would return not only to pre-crisis levels, but even to better ones.
The next day, the newspapers here described Erdogan as having behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm reflected the opposite.
But the coolness that radiates from Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was furious.
Putin accused Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
It will be difficult, perhaps impossible, to rebuild true trust.
Public opinion in Russia has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media led an astounding, in-depth attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were the accusations by senior officials that Erdogan’s own family has profited from illegal oil trade from ISIS-controlled areas in Syria.
He has denied this emphatically.
But in Peter, the official message was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting happened only because Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia has won some kind of victory.
The benefits of a truce are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost ousted from power in last month's failed coup.
The continuing terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia’s economic sanctions have been heavy, especially the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
When it comes to Russia, local tour operators and charter airlines are sure to be relieved when flights finally resume.
They're hoping for a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
And already this week, state TV has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables after agricultural imports from Turkey are again allowed.
"You touristed there, tomatoes back here," as the Vedemosti newspaper report put it.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
In Ankara, there is anger against the West over what is seen as a weak response to an attempted coup d'état.
Add to that the long-standing resentment of snail’s progress in EU membership negotiations, and Putin comes forward, eager to take advantage of the coolness and eroding Turkey’s ties with the West.
The Russian leader was guaranteed to get bulk points from Ankara, where he called after a revolutionary attempt to support the designated authorities.
This, of course, is clear to Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of a change of power.
So this meeting at the gaudy seaside palace made it possible for Russia and Turkey to introduce a "union of outsiders," as one analyst described the situation to me: two countries that feel abandoned and mistreated by the West, joining forces.
However, despite public reconciliation, the two have major differences.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently adapted itself to the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposing sides.
It may be telling that after nearly three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even addressed the issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question in connection with their disagreements, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can look for common ground with regard to Syria.
After months of open hostility, and given the possibility of a full-blown disaster when a NATO member Turkey shoots down a Russian fighter jet, it is surely better that the two leaders are at least speaking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland goes missing from customers outside Scotland
According to the bank’s CEO, the RBS brand will be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s international ambitions.
Since the bank almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued, it has abandoned these objectives.
Bank strategists have since used the 'RBS' brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was backed by millions of pounds spent sponsoring international sports, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to let more national brands come to the fore.
Royal Bank of Scotland is used with Scottish clients, but it will not be restarted from the beginning.
In England and Wales, all RBS references except for headquarters and stock listings are changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use for customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that will gain more exposure: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed on a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will become the employer of our investor brand and our employees, because we will now become a much more brand bank."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
What I am saying is that we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in their respective communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations, and it has raised the profile of various brands in its sports sponsorship.
“Now is the time for us to move in the direction of a bank of brands, because fundamentally (we’ve been asking) it’s about how we can focus on making this a better bank for our customers,” he said.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we’ve done focused on the needs of our customers, not our own, I think you’ll see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori Wins Newmarket with Predilution and Reaches 3,000 Wins
Dettori sprays champagne after a double win for a total of 3,000 wins
Racer Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached a milestone in his second victory at home while competing in John Gosden's Predilution.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in horse racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery, and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who previously won at Ghayyar, said, “This is special.”
I'm very emotional because my family is here, too.
I am very happy that this happened in Newmarket, because I started here 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night and 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
Dettori absorbs cheers as he leads Predilution out after a win.
Two racers have achieved this milestone in steeplechase races – champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 wins in his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggot, 9-time Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best racing riders of the current era, and it is no surprise that he has achieved this milestone, which few have achieved before him.
He is elegant and strong, but his tactical wit sets him apart from the rest of the weighing room.
He is a great ambassador for competitions, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a jockey for the weekend and the big races!
Seriously, Frankie has been riding the winners in the UK for most of 30 years, which is great to see.
He is a lively person who is good for British competition, but on top of that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with his trademark aerial landing from the saddle.
From flighty stops to flighty landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British racing for two decades.
It's been a roller coaster.
Tons of wins in major competitions, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' win at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and was banned from competing because of drugs.
Three years ago, he had a difficult start when he returned after a six-month suspension, but he showed remarkable strength of character when challenging the doubters and returning in his best condition.
And he could go on for a long time - Dettori has previously said he would like to keep racing until at least the age of 50.
Russia's Putin to fire Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has abruptly sacked Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
A Kremlin statement said Putin had “ordered Ivanov to step down as head of Russia’s presidential administration,” but no reason was given.
Ivanov's deputy director since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
She was born in Tallinn, Estonia in 2012, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he headed the president’s protocol and government staff, according to the Kremlin’s website (in Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, “Thank you for your trust.”
In my opinion, the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as a Head of State in drafting laws and in managing the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his seat and recommended that he be replaced by the actor.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has puzzled Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest allies and, like Putin, served as the Soviet security service in the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a televised meeting with President Putin, both men claimed that the chief of staff pulled out at his own request.
But despite the smiles on the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this just the aftermath of a power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man who was once advertised as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead Russia’s environmental policy has been met with real scepticism.
In his comments to Putin quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said: "It is true that early in 2012 I asked you in a debate to assign me for four years to this very complicated, if you can even say laborious, task.
Well, now I've been chief of staff for four years and eight months."
Ivanov accepted the position in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service of the KGB, as is Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the FSB, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy director.
When Putin came to power, he listed Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted the most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become Russian President Putin after a second term, as Putin’s third term would have been unconstitutional.
This task, however, went to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister just three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producer
Last month, Gibson was involved in a physical dispute on set in Los Angeles.
The series' producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced their separation in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, issued an apology Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
There were creative differences and disputes on the set.
I regret that it happened," he said in a statement.
According to a statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details on how Gibson’s character will be removed from the FBI Agents team will be expected later.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been on the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love 'Criminal Minds,' and I've given it my all for the past twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that is not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, producers, actors, our incredible team, and most of all, the best fans the show can have.
The 12th season of the series is scheduled to begin on September 28.
Mystery fish ended up in a garden in Banff
A man living in Banff has asked for help to identify fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be sandeels left behind by a whirlpool.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea, published footage of the apparition on Periscope, hoping that someone could bring clarity to the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now extends to Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the Queensferry crossing point to the north deck and the land bridge, which means that the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of the four locks between the "lid-vessels", which are now being completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10 000 tonnes of steel and 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 strands.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossing.
We are all witnessing some truly impressive engineering work on this project, which has used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel alone to build this section of the bridge.”
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, finishing the lock between the land bridge and the bridge deck is a demanding operation, where extreme precise dimensions must match.
All in all, almost 79% of the bridge deck is now in place and the concrete deck for the last part of the deck is cast today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager at Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first lockdown in any bridge project is always a major milestone.
In this fantastic project, this lock represents the cutting edge of construction technology.
When the last section of the road deck was installed and connected to the road deck of the expanding north pole, we then had to close the remaining section on the north, i.e. inland, side.
This was done by pulling the land bridge of the northern channel 700 mm southward.
This was a huge and at the same time very demanding measure.
The huge land bridge, 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled at an angle of about 3%.
Demanding because the tolerances the team was working with were tiny, only a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, all went well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three Men 'Lucky to Be Alive'
The three men are "lucky to be alive" after falling from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station sounded the alarm at 1:20 p.m. (BST) Friday after the crew saw the event unfold at Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety as their boat moved on by itself.
"We saw the boat circling closer to the men and imagined the worst," said Vince Jones, Moelfre's lifeboat helmsman.
“Fortunately, a strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got moving,” he added.
A local fishing boat rescued two men, and a third, 60-year-old man, was found hanging from a buoy without a life jacket.
The men were taken to a coastal lifeboat and brought back to the rescue station.
Jones said, "These three men in the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had a kill switch rope, but it had somehow detached from the person driving the boat when the boat capsized.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a venerable hunt for health and happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
Over the past decade, many have worried that teenagers and children are no longer going out to play, preferring to spend their free time watching screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get up off the couch and take part in activities.
Screen time was originally limited to TV, then to video games, and now more recently to smartphones.
So it’s great to see that technology and outdoor activity are not mutually exclusive.
I am referring, of course, to a fad called Pokémon Go, an app based on characters that were originally developed in the 1990s for video games (which later became a series of cartoons, playing cards, and other sequels).
Like many pop culture phenomena, its popularity was somewhat diluted before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
After that, the release of the game in other countries was postponed, as huge popularity overloaded the servers.
In just days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In a nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémon that are tracked by GPS and, once found, can be “photographed” (using phone screenshots) or “captured”.
The generation that played the game when they were younger has joined the fad and jumped off the couch to join the search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the daily steps of the "average" person.
The Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game’s release, the number of people moving 30 minutes a day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent for users tracked by Cardiogram.
The company doesn’t know who’s playing Pokémon Gota, it only sees training level information.
The calls of many public health campaigns to "find 30", "get off the couch" and "be active every day" have not produced any results, because most public health warnings are boring and cared for by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
People who move regularly have a lower risk of developing cancer or depression.
Activity helps with weight management, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Its benefits are too numerous to list here.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers the three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends when they hunt.
As usual, disgruntled merrymakers are looking for things to complain about.
Yes, someone can walk into a door.
What's the point?
There's been a breakthrough.
While there were apps like Fitbit in the past that could track activity, they didn’t give you a reason to move around like this game did.
The novelty will disappear and the usage will subside in time.
However, due to the success of Pokémon, there will be other games that combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many hunters to be more active, fit and healthy.

Simone Biles Wins Gold in Women's Gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the publicity.
Simone Biles is immune to all that.
Energetic jumps.
Smooth on the boom.
Unbelievable on the floor.
Brilliant everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast won the multi-match championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between herself and the rest of the world in the spotlight at the Olympics.
His total score of 62,198 was clearly better than that of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American woman to consecutively win the multi-match title, and the fifth American champion overall, while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation, and perhaps of all time.
She burst into tears as her final score was announced, and her long journey toward this moment ended.
This achievement puts him in the same category as other best athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have taken their sport to a new level:
Biles has dominated the sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championships, including 10 gold medals, with programs whose blend of ambition and precision has been so astounding that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
The last test was waiting in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the other competitors, but between him and the burden of over-expectations.
Returning to the family home in Spring, Texas, without a handful of gold medals would have been disappointing.
Simone Biles of the United States, on the left, and Aly Raisman hug after winning a gold and silver medal (in that order) in the women’s artistic gymnastics multi-match final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday, Aug.
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday as he served as the culmination of the departure party of the retiring national team coordinator, Martha Karoly.
While Biles claimed that he never thought about the future as he went his long way to the top, it’s not entirely true.
Part of his permanent programme - the one that includes the volts of his trademark - has been adapted to Latin American music, which would also fit perfectly into the street next to the Olympic arena in Rio.
This is no coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by Aimee Boorman’s mother when she was on a field trip to the gym where Boorman trained, has become a powerhouse.
He hasn’t lost in multiple matches since the summer of 2013, and this winning streak is likely to continue for as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina was in a small lead after two rounds, it was only an illusion.
The balance bar and floor, in which Biles is the reigning world champion, were waiting.
He rose to the top with 15,433 boom points and surpassed them with 15,933 floor.
Raisman hugged her benevolently as they waited for the end points—a mere formality—and tears rose to Biles’ glitter-red, white, and blue eyes as the dream he once wrote about in his scrapbook came true.
Raisman's performance was some sort of revenge for four years ago, when he was in shared third place, but lost the bronze to Mustafina in the rematch.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, whom Americans call “grandmother,” was clearly in charge.
He sent kisses to the public after his performance in the emotional turmoil of the return, which at times seemed questionable.
As for Biles, this 19-year-old’s widespread tweet from earlier this week takes on a whole new meaning:
Police: Three Victims Shot While Listening to Music in Car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to a police statement released Thursday.
Authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot dead in a car parked in the driveway on June 12.
The gunman, who was standing on the passenger side of the car, fired the handgun up to eight times and then fled in another vehicle.
Police said the triple homicide did not appear to be the result of the robbery, as the attacker did not take any handbags or the other adult victim had $2,900.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two injured in nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American neighborhoods in the past four months.
“These are happening in a residential area in front of the home,” Howard told KPHO, a subsidiary of CBS earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators have refused to disclose evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and were committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for his injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
A witness told police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also issued a police report on the shooting, which took place just half an hour before the triple homicide and targeted an empty pickup truck, which is also believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found bullet shells, bullet casings, and bullet fragments in the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: “It’s getting easier”
Edmund Picciuto, like most other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund has a small head, which is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, didn't know about when she was pregnant.
“When he first came home, my first thought was, ‘I can’t do this.’
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for this.
Which is not true at all - of course I promised," he said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never learn to recognize them, and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be institutionalized.
“My first reaction was, ‘I didn’t know people were still doing it,’” Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he is slowly reaching some milestones.
He walks with assistance and rides a bicycle.
She also loves to play with her two brothers and to sing.
Elizabeth shows how the signs Edmund invented signposts to say, "Would you sing for me?"
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But this is no ordinary sign language - he says Edmund has invented some of his own signs.
Microcephaly can be caused by a number of different causes: genetic, as in the case of Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of people infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden of an uncertain future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
And he still doesn't really know.
In fact, I haven’t asked for a forecast in a long time because I don’t expect anyone to be able to actually give me one.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect caused by Zika.
It'll get easier.
Believe me, it'll get easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Heavy rain and flooding triggered rescue operations in Mississippi, Louisiana
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected for the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reported that several rivers in southeastern Louisiana and the southern Mississippi flooded their banks and posed a widespread flood threat due to the extremely heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and that help is already coming to the counties that need it.
Mike Steele of the Governor’s Office of Safety and Emergency Preparedness said they received requests for high-tide vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that Tangipahoa County alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood watch will remain in place until Saturday in much of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that three to five centimetres more rain is expected in the area.
In southern Alabama, a flood watch was in effect on Friday as rain continued to fall in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are both located in Louisiana and were predicted to set a flood-peak record over the weekend.
Weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood several houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said there is a threat of flooding in Ascension County, lower down the river, as the flooded rivers slowly drain into Lake Maurepas.
South of the Mississippi border, the Tickfaw River in Liverpool, Louisiana, was at an all-time high at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescuers are still picking people up from floodwaters in the Amite and Wilkinson counties of southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that the water in Beaver Creek, normally more than 400 feet from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
He says that the other half of the boy, who lives nearby, warned him.
“We woke up, and the water just kept rising,” Hansford said.
It reached down to my waist.
Hansford’s wife told her husband that she had never seen a stream of water so high in the 48 years she had lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family had injuries and that he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said rescue workers rescued the trio in a large army-style truck and took them to the Gloster fire station, where the rescued stayed overnight on Friday.
Krautmann says the floods are "spreading rapidly" as heavy rains continue, and that authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says that a witness near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the country had been completely saturated with heavy rain since Wednesday.
Heavy rain and flooding of streets led to the rescue of residents of Tangipahoa County from their homes and the cancellation of lessons in five school districts, officials said.
WWL, a subsidiary of CBS, reported that in Tangipahoa, a city council member said 200 homes were flooded.
Residents had been evacuated to two churches, but both are now flooded.
County chairman Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and 7 pets trapped in the high tide.
Shelters have been opened in the towns of Amite and Hammond for those who have been evacuated.
"They get to go back to their homes when the water starts to go down," he said.
In the town of Hammond, in Tangipahoa County, some 20 streets were closed due to high tide, and residents were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep water out of their homes and shops.
"The last major flood here was in March," said city administrator Lacy Landrum.
This is becoming a similar case.
In Mississippi, emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said steady rain continued along the Gulf Coast.
He said on Thursday a handful of houses were said to have been flooded, but so far no cases of flooding have been reported so far on Friday.
Keith Townson, the manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places I’ve never seen it before,” Townson said, “and the rain continues.”
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown 'full of bullets' survives Philadelphia shooting
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, marking the second shooting of a six-year-old boy in the city this week.
The child's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name was Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds to the groin, leg, arm, and stomach, among others, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.
I can't believe it.
At the hospital, the boy’s condition has been recorded as critical and he has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the station that he is expected to recover.
The boy was starting his first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown neighborhood.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reported.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be the shooter.
The investigators tell CBS Philadelphia that it appears there was a crossfire between several shooters.
Assault weapon-type shells, originating from various assault weapons, filled the scene of the incident.
It was definitely a constant battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
"So it looks like there were several armed fighters here, and they were in active combat," Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made and according to the information received, the police are examining the tapes of the surveillance camera.
Another six-year-old girl was shot in the arm Tuesday while playing outside her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
So I call this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I’ve been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And secondly: This team includes three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many girls of color.
The composition of this team, supplemented by the Jewish Aly Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
This team looks, finally, like America.
It has also established the presence of black and Hispanic women at the pinnacle of the sport.
The most successful female gymnast in the last four years has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were first and second.
This is awesome.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised as an Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now, the world has witnessed the amazing performances of three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, in which they perform unexpected but masterful gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to win a gold medal in a women’s multi-match.
And teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the pinnacle of the sport, but it doesn’t look like this in gyms across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all followed the same path as Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympic team.
They are the "Final Five" (the last five), because in the next Olympics there will be only four gymnasts in the gymnastics team, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as a coach.
The reality, however, is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts, as a rule, train in private gymnastics clubs, which are maintained by parents who pay for coaching, facilities, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts, as well as for families) and the list goes on.
Much of these gymnastics clubs are located in wealthy suburban neighborhoods that can support the sport.
At these clubs, gymnasts receive all their training, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for gymnast families.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles’ coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez’s coach, have both been coaching their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities where the numerous young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie live.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have provided free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth (mainly black and Latino) and we have coached national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my home city) to offer high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this important Olympic sport.
Gymnasts develop body strength, flexibility and coordination, as well as mental diligence, discipline and determination.
This combination provides lifelong benefits for good health, school and work success.
This team’s inspiration gets thousands of young girls to start gymnastics, and it’s great.
Participation in sports is so important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for demonstrating serious "girl power" by winning the gold medal of the Olympic team, and for motivating so many young girls from all backgrounds to start on the road to a healthy, strong and successful young woman.
Medical interns organising new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The ministers had hoped to put an end to the dispute over the changes by agreeing to an improved agreement with the staff of the British Medical Association, but 58% of the 37,000 medical interns who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force a contract, saying that the NHS was on “unknown ground” and that even minor additional delays would harm staff and patients.
The first interns will be transferred to a new agreement that includes changes to night and weekend work habits to improve care during the difficult hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA's interns committee, said in a statement last night: "Doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, particularly that it will exacerbate the existing labor crisis and that it will not treat all doctors equally."
With only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new agreement, progress must be made and time is running out.
Attempts by the BMA to resolve the dispute through negotiations have been met with reluctance on the part of the government and at times with deep silence.
Despite Jeremy Hunt’s promise last month that his door will always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lift the sanctions and address the concerns of interns.
If he does not do so, the interns of doctors are ready to continue the industrial action.
The latest strike at the end of April meant the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and consulting doctors were recruited to replace doctors on strike watch.
The ministers had hoped to put an end to the dispute over the changes by agreeing to an improved agreement with the staff of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekend pay for the 54,000 interns under contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, appealed to interns not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: “Working battles achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services that are already in a demanding situation, and cause worry, anxiety and disruption to patients, caregivers and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have had discussions with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of the Guardian and Whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that the ongoing positive discussion on other important topics — such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from sabbaticals, educational costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave, and gender pay gap in medicine — is a sign of how seriously employers, Health Education England, and the Ministry of Health have respected their November, February, and May agreements with the BMA.
A drug that costs two pounds a day may reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from a two-pound-a-day-paying drug after authorities recommended that it be given to people for longer.
The anticoagulation drug, ticagrelor, lowers the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
The medicine is given as early as 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of having a stroke or another attack.
The NHS supervisor, NICE, has advised that it should be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS supervisor, NICE, has advised that it should be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year in England, and a quarter of these suffer a second attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by a build-up of fat in the artery wall that forms stenosis.
If the stenosis ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that blocks blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the clot is detached, it can travel through the blood and cut off blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one seizure have an increased risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the UK company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clotting less likely.
A draft NICE guidance published today recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg taken with aspirin twice a day for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: “Despite the availability of effective progression-preventing therapies, up to a quarter of people who have a heart attack later have a second heart attack or stroke, the consequences of which are often devastating.”
Fear of relapse can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
With our initial recommendation for ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to add available treatment options to the many thousands of people who may benefit from them.
Due to the limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, in particular with regard to the risk of bleeding, for periods of more than three years, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment for longer than this period.
A culture of political correctness allows voter fraud to flourish in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year for corruption, prompting a government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities being ignored, revealed today in a shocking government report.
Sir Eric Pickles, a former government minister, scolded the police, election officials and city councils for ignoring evidence of voter fraud due to “racial and religious hypersensitivity.”
The former community secretary, now the anti-corruption emperor, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds is so serious that the police should be allowed to place chains of guards outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He recommends that voters should present an identity card when they vote to prove who they are.
Today, all a voter has to do is state his name and address.
The report even suggests putting indelible ink on the voter’s finger so that no one can vote twice.
Whistleblowers should be better protected, Sir Eric says.
He calls for greater access for the press to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
"This would not only protect against electoral fraud, but it would also protect the local government from a broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with electoral fraud," he said.
The government commissioned a report following the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the incumbent mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following numerous accusations of corruption and illegal activities.
The court said Rahman "cynically distorted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have “led his election campaign on the grounds that it was the religious duty of loyal Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes were questionable or the result of a person voting while performing as someone else.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern at the electoral fraud in postal voting, in which high-ranking members of the Muslim community were said to have pressured people to vote for a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made several recommendations for cleaning up the voting system, including proof of identity with an identity card
He said: "Evidence was presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote at the will of the elders, especially in communities with a Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
Concerns were raised that...state institutions had ignored such behavior due to “politically correct” racial and religious sensitivities.
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean up the system, including a ban on political activists having access to postal ballots in order to stop the 'collection of votes'.
The report, which Mrs May is considering, also calls for tougher checks on registrations in order to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Consider options for verifying the identity of voters before voting.
Use indelible ink on the voter’s finger so that no one can vote twice.
Conduct systematic nationality checks to make sure they are eligible to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prevent political activists from processing ready-made mail-in ballots and envelopes in which the ballots are sent.
Let the police put chains around the polling stations.
Change the law to make it easier to accuse people of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography illegal at polling stations.
Require that only English be used at polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure staff adhere to the rule that the voter should go into the booth alone.
Sir Eric slams the Greater London police force, saying it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets incident.
"The electoral court has been stayed by Lutfur Rahman and his officials as a result of numerous corruption and illegal actions," he said.
He was found guilty on numerous grounds, without any doubt, according to the criminal evidence threshold.
He also criticised the ineffective "check-box" checks in the voting registration offices of city councils.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's Tower Hamlets conviction was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a glorious legacy as a creator of parliaments, but this worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of the facts of certain groups threatens this good reputation."
Crazy about Kate's biker doppelganger and other celebrity selfies at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics have gone mad over French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be the impressive double of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian isn’t really the only gold-fighting athlete this summer who can boast of his own famous double – at least according to social media.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and the Wolf: U.S. male archery team member Brady Ellison, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate’s bike track doppelganger, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of the star Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men’s archery team, has caused a storm on Twitter after his photos surfaced showing him looking frighteningly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star.
And in fact, when he became aware of the social media craze, the archer admitted that he had heard that he looked like Leo since he was a child.
“I don’t see much of a resemblance to myself, except maybe with a beard,” Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will surely come to the fore again this year: the striking resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina, with her big, expressive eyes, is said to be the doppelganger of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has for years been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison.
Bigger gear for the eye: This user thinks Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another longstanding comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both of whom have similar strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medallist Yulia Efimova has more in common with actress Annalynne McCord than tanned skin and blond hair, while US team Nathan Adrian is said to resemble a "sporty version of Joseph Gordon Levitt" by fans.
Tough Women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, share a similar face shape and eyes
Not alone: One Twitter user was very pleased that others saw the similarities
Theorizing: According to this user, there may be a reason for the pair’s similarity
One Twitter user recently expressed his happiness on the site that "others on the Internet think Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the American football star and the actress Dexter indeed have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, and gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, whose own, beautifully wide smile matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic Commentator Apologizes for Chinese Swimmer 'Dead Like a Pig'
Byron MacDonald’s analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan’s fourth-place women’s 4x200m freestyle message enraged viewers of CBC’s live Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
Canadian broadcaster CBC has apologized after one of its reporters said a 14-year-old Chinese female swimmer "disappeared like a bad smell" and "died like a pig."
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began sharing some of his own opinions in the women’s 4x200m freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who came to the CBC commentary team to bring "color," was heard to say, "That little 14-year-old from China is your boob, baby.
Too eager, disappeared like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam between 1:57.79 and 1.61 seconds slower than Taylor Ruck of Canada, allowing Canada to capture China.
Viewers across Canada react quickly online after being shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC reporter just say the 14-year-old swimmer in China 'died like a pig'???
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air."
China’s Ai Yanhan was described in the women’s 4 x 200m freestyle relay final as “That little 14-year-old from China messed up, baby.”
Criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter was strong and fast, with many challenging him.
Twitter users didn’t hold back when they heard how reckless Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: “Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like racist people.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized live for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We're sorry that the comment about the swimming performance was aired.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we are sorry that it happened."
CBC apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to the comment.
Scott Russell had to apologize on MacDonald’s behalf.
The CBC then copied and attached an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald’s comments.
The company quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and that they were sent live.
We quickly took action last night and apologized live to our viewers and followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity, it must be said that Byron’s comments were related to the swimmer’s performance, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized live and tried to define his remark by stating that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
“I would like to apologize right now for the comment I made last night after the women’s message,” she said on CBC’s Olympic broadcast.
"I was referring to the swimmer's performance, not him as a person."
Needless to say, I didn’t mean it as disrespectful, and I’m really sorry.”
Primark customer shocked by woman brazenly fitting underwear in the middle of the store
Customers didn’t know where to look when a woman undressed in the middle of the Primark shop to try on her underwear.
What didn’t make things better was that, after assessing how he looked in his pants, she peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.
He continued to touring and eventually fitted four pairs of underwear in a store located in the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
Primark's shop at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where a woman tried on underwear and then put it back on the shelf
Meanwhile, Jenny Davidson, a mother of two, said that after trying on underwear, the mysterious woman “redressed herself and walked out of the store without buying anything.”
He said, "People couldn't believe their eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store floor, took out a pair of undies, took off her own stockings and underwear, and put them on her feet.
"He didn't even try to find a secluded place to atone for it, he just stood there shamelessly."
“Everybody was staring at him again when he took off his underpants and obviously didn’t like them because he put them back on the shelf.”
He did the same for three more pairs before finally deciding he didn’t like anything he saw, got dressed again and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care who was watching or thinking about the person who would end up buying the panties he was fitting."
Davidson, a 33-year-old from Kent, said: “It’s disgusting to think that someone is taking home underwear that someone else has tried but hasn’t cleaned.”
The incident occurred Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I realized that the staff apparently tried to remove the garments after the woman left, which is fine."
“It would be terrible to go home with new underwear and find that another woman has put them on and taken them off and they have not been washed.”
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred in the Folkestone movement on Tuesday 9 August.
All these products have been withdrawn from sale."
This is how you can defend yourself from armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com can make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with the Grand Master of the Krav Maga Federation, Rhon Mizrach, who lives in New York, to find out how to handle gun-wielding robbers at close range.
Whether you were approached from the front or from behind, this video shows you how to pay the attacker the same.
According to Mizrachi, if you are approached from behind, the first turn is to see your attacker and "raise the line of fire".
You then grab the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Continue by hitting the knee in the groin, and when the attacker goes from pain to pain, wring the gun from his hands, hit him with the back of the gun in the face, and back away, keeping the gun pointed at him.
If an armed person approaches from the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the gun and turn it around so that the criminal is unable to fire.
At the same time, put weight on the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun out of his hand, back away and point the gun at him.
Does that sound difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does this.
But remember that if you are not the Grand Master of Krav Maga, the safest way out of a robbery situation is to give up your money.
Tourist Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide
A British traveler has set a serious challenge to his immune system and his vomiting reflex by licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Ian Wright, 51, a presenter and travel writer from Suffolk, licked a euro note, railing at Piccadilly Circus, a toilet flush button on a train, and a Russian public phone to prove his immune system was strong.
Before licking each object, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was getting into.
However, the experiment, which was made into a film called Traces of Inner Power, produced surprising results.
The idea of licking the flush button on a train used by thousands of people may seem absolutely repugnant, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On his journey across Europe, Wright talked constantly to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of his arrows left him with a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known as an intestinal endurance tester as he traveled around the world and ate strange and wonderful things.
This task, extending from the railings of public railway stations to the flush button on the toilet seat, really tested his immune system.
In the film, he said: "Since childhood I have been quite carefree about my health, and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth, starting with dirt, worms and muddy water."
He confirmed his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a filthy Russian public toilet.
His sample contained a photometer reading of over 4,000 units.
For comparison, the number of newly washed hands should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public restroom, he refused to lick when the photometer reading was over 4,000 units, and the result of freshly washed hands was less than 60.
Wright has produced the traveller’s film, Following the Inner Force, together with the Finnish dairy, Valio. The film shows the amount of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the movie, the wedding said, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything 'cause it's gross in here.
Following in the footsteps of internal strength, it was produced together with the Finnish dairy, Valio.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D that help boost the gut bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio’s Head of Snacks, Juice and New Categories, said: “We really wanted to offer something new to consumers.
Something that would be fascinating to look at, and at the same time would explain the benefits of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air, and we ended up thinking, ‘Let’s call Ian.’”
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: to talk about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and its connection to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and with the help of this documentary we can tell more about it to consumers in an interesting way.
I think the documentary also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
The documentary's director, Tom Hakala, added: "Let's put it this way: if Ian had licked some of the things I asked him to do, like the disgusting Russian toilet in the movie, I would have lost respect for him."
Understandably, some of the licking was easier for Ian, while others were quite difficult.
I’m glad we got some of those dirty licks recorded.”
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 per cent of the respondents specifically linked lactic acid bacteria to the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 per cent said that they at least occasionally use products to which lactic acid bacteria have been added.
A family of bullies destroyed a tenement in Saltash, Cornwall, before being evicted
A family of bullies caused <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 in damage to their tenement after they were evicted for terrorizing their neighbours.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of a property in Saltash, Cornwall, after numerous complaints about them.
When they were forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing company officials found the property in poor condition.
Gaping holes had been made in the walls, floorboards had been torn, debris had been spread on the floor, and the walls had been smeared with graffiti.
The family has now moved away and is believed to be living in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, head of Cornwall Housing, said she feared the property could not be repaired.
He said: "It's been a real nightmare for the residents and I don't think people should have to live like this.
There are a lot of things to consider here, as this property is likely to be known through Cornwall’s less-comfortable groups.
This family is infamous, and their name is infamous.”
The couple had three sons who occasionally lived on the property, and police said the family’s reign of terror included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug sales, and excessive shouting, arguing, and swearing.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was on the lease, was convicted of antisocial behavior in June.
Old waste was found in many of the rooms of the house under demolition threat.
The floorboards of the property, from which the drugs had previously been delivered, had been pulled up.
Neighbors said that the family was seen fighting on the street and that police were called on a regular basis.
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted the woman and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period of time, 11 weeks, to voluntarily move.
The relieved neighbors thanked the eviction, saying that their lives had become a living hell.
Someone said, "They didn't care about anybody."
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We've seen the police around here an incredible number of times.
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
It's wonderful now that they're finally gone."
Cornwall Housing neighborhood executive Adam Fitzpatrick said the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often called to the property
Trash and old toys have been thrown down the rental house’s wild wall.
He added: "It is a pity that the resident did not take any responsibility for his own and his family's behaviour, as eviction is always the last policy considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, for the behavior was extreme, and their actions must have terrified the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, by the Devon and Cornwall police and by the brave members of the community who have informed us.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to the neighbours and send a message that anti-social behaviour will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that the three boys all lived in the property at different times, but they were all in their twenties.
Dirty mattress left on one bedroom floor after eviction
Homeowners now have to clean up the waste piles around the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found more than 70 grams of cannabis along with a scale, supplies, and <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for admitting to possession of a class B drug with the intent to distribute it.
He claimed that the money was intended for the gravestone of his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her partner are homeless, now living in private accommodation in Plymouth.
There were graffiti on many of the walls of the house.
Police say they are trying to evict residents who flout the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police said the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.
"This is a message for those who think their behavior is without consequences, as well as for those who suffer from such behavior," he said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour. The police will continue to work with their collaborators to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a military jet flew low on the beach
Sun-worshipping tourists in Aveiro, Portugal, experience shock of their lives
The P-3C Orion jet of the Portuguese Air Force was very low.
The Air Force said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised.
It was at this very moment that the terrified tourists began to panic when a low-flying jet plane swept over a crowded beach.
The dramatic recording shows how a military aircraft came within close touch with the sun worshippers on a stretch of sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The vacationers stood up when they began to understandably worry about the noise coming from the jet, although at first they could not see what was coming at them from behind the clouds.
The incident took place yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
One of the numerous vacationers who posted videos of the dramatic flyby on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said, “It went by twice really low, and at one point it looked like it was going to crash to the ground.”
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and it really felt like a plane was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were horrified when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify fishing boats near the coast, and the plane had to land so low that it was the only way to check the boats.
He said the jet had flown significantly lower than usual due to poor visibility due to smoke from nearby wildfires, but the air force assured that no one’s safety was at risk.
This summer, wildfires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly at low visibility due to adverse conditions, smoke from wildfires and thick fog.
The aircraft was on a training flight, and as part of the exercise the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats
Eksote’s first half-year result better than expected
The Social and Health Care District of South Karelia (Eksote) reported a EUR 3.4 million better-than-planned result in January-June.
Eksote posted a surplus of EUR 4.3 million in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has enabled the dismantling of institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was fulfilled in all operations.
Eksote aims to shorten the waiting lists this year.
Eksote covers the previously created deficit by covering the surplus.
The remainder may be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The full-year result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
Eksote’s Board of Directors will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special border soldiers take military oath in Immola
The 70 conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School took the military oath on Friday.
The Military Ceremony of the Border and Coast Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Special Frontier Jaeger Course was held on the garrison’s sports field.
Seventy soldiers were sworn in.
Special Border Guards are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for the position.
250 of them were invited to the tests.
Special Border Jaegers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans of the wartime frontier forces were present at the meeting organised in connection with the oath ceremony.
The average age of the participants is now 90 years old.
The oldest veterans who participated in the event were born in 1918.
Criminal intelligence helps to solve crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
Each of Finland’s 11 police departments has had a Criminal Intelligence and Analysis Unit (RTA) since the beginning of 2014.
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
At the Häme Police Department, the unit consists of a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's run by a sergeant stationed in the Bay.
The Chief of Staff is Lieutenant Lahti.
In addition, the unit’s strength includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in civilian clothes.
The unit has proved its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides the rest of the police with various reports.
In Häme, it has, among other things, obtained information on asylum seekers.
Reform of the latest working methods
The establishment of analysis units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. that the police would not leave the swamps until they received an alert.
With the help of the information collected and analysed by the unit, daily policing is targeted where it is most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, a criminal intelligence centre was established in the country, with less than three national units and a criminal intelligence unit for each police station.
The PTR Centre, which operates in connection with the Central Criminal Police in Vantaa, leads operations nationwide.
As the name suggests, the PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and the Border Guard.
The RTA units, in turn, work in areas divided by police departments and have the task of providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Inquiries extend beyond your own territory
While an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is happening throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the borders of one’s own institution, because so does crime.
Those working in the RTA unit have computer skills better than the basic police.
The unit aims to draw the police’s attention to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes with the help of registers, alert task databases and observations.
This is called serialization and is one of the most important criminal intelligence tools.
Everyone has their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible in the work, whether it is honest or criminal.
Based on the method, a certain image is formed of the perpetrator.
The serialization can be done either on the basis of the method or on the basis of the person, depending on which of the police has more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not walk around the city with their collars up, but their work is not completely public either.
The methods used by both criminals and criminals are not disclosed, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus trying to prevent the police from trying to combat crime.
The police will publicly disclose the methods if they pose a threat.
Such an incident was, for example, the marking method used in home burglaries in the early summer.
In it, the workers put a stick, pin, or piece of tape on the front door of the apartment to test whether the residents were really traveling.
The pre-trial investigation material is public at least to the parties.
The Analysis Unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they make.
The cleverest ones order the district court’s minutes, which may indicate, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the place.
Next time, we'll go to the thieves with gloves on.
The interviewees were Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppä from the Häme Police Department, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police Department, Inspector Sami Joutjärvi from the Joensuu Police Station and Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police Department.
The police collect and analyse information to plan practical actions.
This is due to a decrease in the amount of labour and funding.
The first steps towards a new way of working were taken already 30 years ago.
The most recent change was the three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation is used to collect information from outside the home institution and Finland’s borders.
Isis schoolgirl from London killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, has reportedly died in Syria.
The lawyer, Tasnime Akunjee, said her family heard that she died in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that the girl was believed to have been killed in a Russian airstrike on Raqqa, the organization’s base in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died while planning to escape from a war-torn country and return to Britain.
“One can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can serve as a tombstone and testament to others that there are real risks involved in going to a war zone — that it could deter people from making such a decision,” Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London schoolgirls flew to Turkey, where they took a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultana’s family was told that the girl had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and that she became a widow after only a few months.
Reid says Clinton will keep Garland as Supreme Court nominee if he is elected
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is convinced Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected president.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland’s confirmation since he was appointed by President Barack Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will elect the person to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a teleconference on Thursday that he predicts with "some degree of certainty" that Clinton will choose Garland.
Reid's spokesman later said he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would appoint Garland, and that it was speculation.
He praised Garland and said the Clinton team would not want to "rock the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reid said the Republicans blocking Garland's nomination are "the minions" and "enablings" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is not fit for office.
Treats says nude calendar is “for women as well as for men”
Treats magazine is collaborating with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar for 2017 inspired by the 1970s Pirelli.
But instead of naked celebrities, they plan to find the next generation of supermodels for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, president of Treats, told us earlier this year that his magazine, which features plenty of nude photos, is different from the old-school Playboy because “Playboy is for men.”
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is for them too.
“We need to start presenting again the timeless and classic nudity in which women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired with these images of the naked female body,” Shaw said in a press release.
Women want to be part of this project because it is beautiful art.
Models can submit images online or in person at open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
The destination of vinyl: who actually buys the records?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyl.
Before you rush to fill the comments section with irritable insults written by the pseudonym NotAllSingleMedium Men, please note that this claim is based on real data.
According to YouGov, the much talked about resurgence of records is not due to the fact that more and more people born in this millennium are excited about the novelty of physical objects, but the yearning of middle age.
Apparently, those who have recently purchased a vinyl record are most likely between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, those in the 18-24 age group are the most unlikely to buy records.
It’s also not just a matter of collecting hobbyists, but it also has an emotional meaning: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their emotions inside (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog were a news report on television, the camera would follow me as I walk down a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit. I would be waving vigorously before I stopped, forming a cup out of my hands and saying something authoritative, such as: “Let’s take a closer look.”
Let us examine this further.
While the charm and dirt of Soho is slowly being removed – hotels, chain restaurants and stores, and office supplies stores are now filling up with buildings that used to have independent stores – a handful of stunning specialized record stores still remain.
For the next section, I’d probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a moment as I stand very close to different men in some of these stores trying to gauge their age and emotional temperament.
Stuart of Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (counter: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in their twenties), spends his afternoon in London for a meeting, and wanders around the shops to spend a few hours.
I asked if he was a collector.
"I suppose I am," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These boards, which are shown in the photo above (she sent a sample by email, I did not follow her home), cover the walls of her living room.
The reason for acquiring such a huge number of records and singles is partly due to his disposable income: now he can buy records he couldn’t afford when they were originally released, and he can re-buy the ones he sold when he was young and penniless.
"A lot of the material I bought is from the late '60s and early '70s, records that were released when I was 11 or 12, records that I was probably a little too young to get," he says.
He agrees that record buyers are more likely to be introverts enjoying their own company, and adds, “I don’t smoke or drink a lot.
This is my vice."
25-year-old Wez, who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers she meets fit the profile of YouGov.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the media’s enthusiasm, people who have heard that records are back in fashion and who have a need to buy their old records back.
Based on the discussions I have had, people have disposed of their collection, usually in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyls to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back their CDs,” he says.
This may explain the increase in the number of vinyl awakenings at a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional significance of the records?
In a store like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores provide a comforting community for like-minded people.
According to Wez, some older customers have been injured, especially by the contactless payment system.
Some vinyl fans may be overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to rely on the permanence of familiar album covers; objects that evoke memories of teenage happy days.
“I think sometimes it can be about filling a gap or some kind of comfort that owning things creates,” Wez says.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It’s an easy way to fill your mind.
“We’re like their social workers!” another worker suddenly said from the pile of records.
A poll conducted by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who had purchased a vinyl record in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a turntable that they never use, while 7% of vinyl buyers don’t have a turntable.
At this point in the news report, I’d probably look seriously worried while browsing through a stack of bossa nova collections.
This “reward” aspect of the revival is something that Jonny, 42, who works in the Sounds of the Universe (calculator: three middle-aged men), has also noticed.
"Someone came in a while ago and said, 'I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf,'" he says.
This is not a big part of it, but it is definitely happening.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
Not the older ones, but the younger ones, the late teens, who are just getting excited about it.
Foppi, where nowadays almost an entire floor is reserved for vinyls, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the previously mentioned stores – the speakers exude Wild Beast’s freshest synth- and sex-filled pop, rather than improvisational jazz – it’s great to see a variety of customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it’s hard to prove the gnawing psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fopp for a few minutes, looking at different albums for sale.
He's out window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn't make much money, so collecting records isn't really an option.
"It's expensive.
It’s easy to listen to music either on the computer or through something else, but the beauty of vinyl is...” she sighs in love.
"I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique."
My last stop is said to have sparked a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While trying to look like I’m researching denim shorts, I observe a group of teenage girls gathering around Polaroid cameras for a moment before father and daughter consider buying Crosley’s turntable.
On the left is a staircase, the wall of which is covered with records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, essential records of any average collection.
No one is looking at them - perhaps because they are just decorations, and some are so high that it would be impossible to touch them.
It is purely “artistic”.
But considering that even a little attention to these items can mean more money for the industry and sending a few customers to the depths of Soho to get more, there’s not much to complain about here.
It comes as no surprise that the segment of the population that is more likely to have more time and money is also the one that spends the most on luxury items, such as vinyls.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov’s results are accurate, at least for record stores in Soho, they don’t rule out the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, record stores, and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or in the office.
They certainly don’t spend their Thursday mornings fooling around the Berwick Street record stores browsing through records and avoiding the look of a creepy 30-year-old TV host peering over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holkeri is the longest living vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say that the holker has a longer life span than any other vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studied sharks, says the record is set by a female believed to be between 272 and 512 years old, who is five metres long.
French court rejects request to close Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a request from the Calais authorities to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, which is home to thousands of refugees.
In court proceedings this week, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to dismantle a total of 72 temporary shops where people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence), or sell simple food for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais Prefect’s office argued that the sites should be demolished because they represent a tax-free parallel economy and because they are a risk of fire and sanitation.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying the free meals provided by the state-sponsored organization and other groups do not provide enough food for the increasing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free meals for those who need them.
A court in Lille ruled that there were no legal grounds for evicting 72 people who were running errands, but said the concern of the prefect of Calais was "completely understandable".
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than just feeding people "who live in extreme conditions of uncertainty".
He said the facilities offered peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened with demolition was the Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, a non-profit that provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum advice to hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's cafe.
A letter to the Guardian said closing the cafe would be “a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old.”
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in the Jungle camp has risen to 9,000 — a peak — since arrivals rose sharply over the summer.
Food prices in Finland fall clearly faster than the EU average
Food prices in Finland are falling sharply to the delight of consumers and the annoyance of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by nearly five per cent in three years, while in the EU countries, on average, its price has fallen by 0.9 per cent.
Meanwhile, in Germany and Sweden, food has become one percent more expensive.
Over the past three years, the price of food in Finland has fallen to second place among the EU countries with wage levels similar to those in Finland.
In comparison, only in the UK has the price of food fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are based on an article by Ilkka Lehtinen, Head of Development at Statistics Finland, published on the Tieto & Trends blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices that are related to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data are from June of this year.
In the early 2010s, the price of food rose sharply.
In 2013 prices were close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
“We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership,” Lehtinen says.
Then came a turning point, after which the food has become cheaper year by year.
The price is now being weighed down by Russia’s food import bans, which have halted food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have decreased.
“Putin’s policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term,” Lehtinen says.
Tighter price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
The large retail chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For consumers, price competition has been reflected in spectacular advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not a haven for cheap food, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland among the EU countries with wage levels similar to those in Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the comparison countries had the same VAT rate, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with the same wage level.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, the UK, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate in comparison countries were seven per cent, only Germans and Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finns.
“If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in the price of food, VAT must be halved to the EU countries’ average and the price competition will continue,” Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that his calculations on the VAT rate are indicative.
School is no longer what it used to be.
Those who return to school may notice that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been prepared for schools, which will be introduced in all primary schools at the beginning of the semester.
It is a guideline that all Finnish schools should follow.
The schools themselves decide the details, but the plan states the official goals.
The new guidelines have been prepared for several years, and they differ from the old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, learning cursive writing will be abandoned, and instead schools will begin to practice coding.
Swedish education begins in the sixth grade at the latest, and social studies begins in the fourth grade.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of students.
It used to be thought that teachers teach students, but now everyone has to be active and learn from each other.
This is how we try to make school more interesting.
World's longest vertebrate found, ice shark may live up to 400 years
The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) does not reach sexual maturity until it is 150 years old.
It could live another 250 years, according to a new study.
These numbers make it the longest-living vertebrate in the world today.
In the animal kingdom, it is only passed by an Icelandic mussel, whose oldest known specimen is dated to 507 years old.
Greenland sharks swim across the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than males, they can grow up to five metres tall.
Because the rate of growth is slow, according to surveys only about one centimeter per year, adult individuals have by necessity lived for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He measured the ages of adult ice sharks from 28 females caught in fishermen’s nets.
The age of the fish was revealed by radiocarbon dating.
The average age of the sharks tested was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 493- and 502-centimeter-long Amazon fins, were found to be about 335 and 392 years old, respectively.
Since previous studies have found that ice stork females reach sexual maturity only when they are over four metres tall, the researchers calculated that they are around 150 years old at that point.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann sacks nearly 300 - sellers not reduced
Nearly 300 employees will be laid off from the department store company Stockmann.
The joint ventures in the troubled company ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of the negotiations, about 300 jobs will be cut, the majority of which will be implemented in the form of redundancies," Stockmann said in a statement.
According to this, the number of sellers of department stores will not be reduced, so that customer service will not suffer.
In addition, around 80 employees in support functions will be offered new jobs as sellers.
Stockmann’s co-operation negotiations concerned approximately 3,000 employees.
When they started, the need for reduction was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The population reduction is aimed at annual cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million, which are expected to be realised during the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme that aims to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background is Stockmann’s difficulties in making department store trade profitable.
Although the Group’s adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the department store trade is still loss-making.
According to Stockmann’s acting CEO Lauri Veijalainen, sales in department stores have not met the company’s targets.
"Unfortunately, personnel reductions are necessary to ensure a positive operating result for Stockmann Retail in 2018," said Veijalainen.
The second quarter result improvement was mainly due to the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best ever second-quarter revenue and result.
Lindex’s operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
In the same period last year, the entire Stockmann Group recorded a loss of 4.1 million euros.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday will be the rainiest in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees throughout the country
The low-pressure centre in the northern part of Finland will keep the weather rainy on Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
There will also be rain showers in the central part of the country, but there will be cascades further south.
The temperature is not very summery anymore, as the mercury is below 20 degrees Celsius in the whole country.
In the rainy areas of the north will remain at 10-15 degrees.
Kenya's athletics team is rocked by doping scandal - a strange explanation for the coach's action
Kenyan athletics coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it was revealed that Anzrah appeared as a national team athlete in a doping test.
The Associated Press reported that the athlete Anzrah was trying to appear in is the 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya's national team, said Anzrah's identity was revealed after he gave Rotich a sample in a surprise test.
Doping officials reported to the authorities in Anzrah.
Soi said Anzrah was sent home because he "committed his crime against the Kenyan national team".
He posed as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour," Kenyan Olympic Committee chairman Kip Keino told Reuters.
The Olympic track and field starts on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run at that time.
It is not yet known if the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth at the World Championships last year and is Rio’s favourite pre-winner.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan athletics team claimed that Anzrah traveled with the athlete’s accreditation card only to receive free meals at the race village.
When anti-doping officials confronted him, they assumed he was an athlete and took him to a test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials, because he was afraid to be revealed," the source said.
Where's everybody at?
Rio’s athletics stadium is empty
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium watching athletics.
Rio began the fight for the athletics medals on Friday, but the world’s top individuals were allowed to showcase their skills to a bewilderingly empty crowd.
Rio organizers said Friday that only 58 percent of the first day’s morning and 65 percent of the evening’s tickets had been sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium was full of cheering people.
Tickets for the finals are already sold out in Rio.
The loss of spectators at the Rio Olympics has attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been seen in the stands of rugby, canoeing and horseback riding.
When Brazil’s Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the stadium was full.
After the Brazilian pair, the Netherlands played against Russia, and only about 30 percent of the 12,000-seat crowd was full.
The poor performance is at least explained by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with economic difficulties, is far from home to European and Asian competition tourists, and many Olympic sports are strange to Brazilians accustomed to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team did not complete the football stadium.
Race organisers spokesman Mario Andrada said at the weekend that 82% of the tickets had been sold at the time, which is clearly lower than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million left to sell," Andrada said.
Of the 8.5 million tickets sold at the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, although tickets cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have ranged from around nine euros to over a thousand euros at the opening.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but in Rio this is not yet allowed, because the organizers need money and are trying to sell tickets until the last minute.
However, in Rio, organizers have given 240,000 tickets to school children in the country for lesser-known sports such as golf and rugby.
Rio’s stadium had plenty of empty seats this morning.
Not even a beach volleyball on the sands of Copacabana has interested the audience.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.
The people in the gallery were enough.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation in new ways.
The foundation, established last year, acquires ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, private individuals, companies and communities can use the money to redeem the title rights to the land.
The foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land is virtually divided into parcels, which can be acquired by those who wish to acquire the right of ownership for a fee.
The holder will be given the right to veto its 187 square metre block, which in practice means that approval from each holder is not required if the use of the land is to be changed.
You can also acquire holder rights for more than one block.
The acquisition of the right of possession is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or a gift.
You don’t have to carry banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature,” says Juha Leviäkangas, who has acquired the right of possession for his company.
A person who has acquired the right of possession receives precise location information from the block, which enables, for example, a visit to the block.
The Foundation’s website displays the names of the holders on the same map as the parcel of land.
Leviäkangas sees only the fact that the Foundation’s operations will change from its original idea as a risk in its nature conservation procurement.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a non-profit foundation with the purpose of promoting the protection of the environment and nature.
There is a risk that the foundation would act in some way unethical or commercially, but this should not be possible.
Helsinki Foundation’s Haltija project is based on the idea of protecting nature areas so that they can be untouched and in peace.
The Foundation acquires land either by purchase or as a donation.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of property rights, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims beyond Finland’s borders and plans to acquire land in Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop-up forest at the Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
Bike thieves are the worst tormentors of big cities in Turku - see the situation in your municipality
Bicycle thieves torment Turku the most of Finland’s big cities.
This year, more bikes have been stolen in proportion to the population than in nine other major cities.
Based on the bicycle thefts reported to the police, Helsingin Sanomat investigated how many bicycles and their parts were stolen in the ten largest cities in January-August of this year per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to police, there were four to five bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
In Espoo and Kouvola, on the other hand, only about two bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants were reported to the police.
It's a big difference, isn't it?
“In some cities, in proportion to the population, there is a double number of thefts compared to others,” Tommi Reen, a police inspector at the National Police Board, describes.
The police are wondering why the city is at the top of the rankings.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
"The frequency of theft can be affected by how many people ride bikes in the city and how many bikes there are," says Sergeant Teemu <0xC3><0x84>ikäs.
The National Police Board’s Tommi Reen considers it highly expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will rise to the top in the comparison.
The number of bike thefts largely depends on the cities of study and cycling.
Turku has a dense city centre, short distances and plenty of bikes available for thieves.
"Espoo, for example, is a completely different type of city, where urban centres are far apart and bicycles are not necessarily the primary means of transport," Reen says.
In the whole of Finland, slightly fewer bicycle thefts were reported to the police in January-August than in the corresponding period of last year.
But there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police report a little over 20,000 bicycle thefts a year.
That means 50-60 bikes every day and in Helsinki alone about 4,000 bikes a year.
“It’s a lot of money,” Reen said.
In reality, thieves take more bikes, as only some of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen calls on people to report a bicycle theft, even though fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police survives.
A typical solved bicycle theft is one in which the police are informed of the theft immediately and the thief is caught red-handed.
"Cases are also revealed in connection with other investigations, when, for example, in a drug case, stolen bikes can be found in the apartment," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly in the act itself or in connection with a police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bicycles are stolen, for example, from bike racks in shopping centres, courtyards, warehouses and bicycle cellars, i.e. practically everywhere where they are usually stored.
As in previous years, most of the individual bicycle models are stolen Jopoja.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take the bike for short-term personal use, for example, but a large number of stolen bikes end up on sale, for example, online.
They remain in the domestic market.
"At least the police have not been informed that the stolen bikes are going abroad very much," Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
Some people buy a stolen bike without even knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of a used bike must be careful, as he or she may be guilty of a hide-and-seek offence or misdemeanor.
"The alarm bells should be ringing if a good-looking bike is sold at a price well below that," Reen says.
Special library clerk Severi Hirvi carries his colourful Nopsa to the Kallio Library in Helsinki for the duration of his working day.
He has had five wheels, but not one has been stolen, says Elk. "Never been taken, there has been a good monk."
"Perhaps this doesn't attract thieves so much, there's not necessarily any hipster value in this either," the Helsinki-based Hirvi ponders.
Siiri Valve, who quickly visited a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked her bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now the bike was hanging up against the wall, but usually Valve locks the bike to something fixed, such as a bike rack.
"It's a lot to think about, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," says a student from Helsinki about his white bike, the frame of which alone cost about five hundred euros.
"You hear from your friends all the time that the bikes have been stolen."
"Mostly bad bikes, those kind of snot-nosed joggers."
A bicycle was stolen from the inner yard of a housing company a year ago.
The bike had been left unlocked, so Valve expected it to be stolen.
Children under the age of 15 are responsible for their crimes.
Helsinki to test out U.S.-familiar jurors
In Helsinki, a so-called peer jury is being tested to prevent young people from being caught in a criminal cycle.
Initially, the experiment will apply to children under the age of 15, who are now left without criminal responsibility.
The peer jury intervenes in the first crime committed by a young person.
The idea is that the peer jury will discuss the incident with the offender and impose a sanction.
A week later, the offender can join the peer jury to make amends.
Other consequences may include a letter to the family explaining what has been done and what lessons have been learned.
The head of the youth department, Tommi Laitio, says that the model is not strict.
We have other models of mediation that are used in parallel.
“Everyone steers the young person’s activities in a more responsible direction so that everything would not be ruined by the first mistake,” Laitio says.
The peer jury has been modelled on the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after their first crime a young person is not in front of an adult panel, but reflects on what happened with people around the same age.
The model was tried once.
Iikka Lovio, a service designer at Palmu, who followed the experiment, says that it was an assault that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first offences committed by persons under 15 years of age may not have been dealt with at all before.
“It’s been a message to continue down the path you’ve chosen,” Lovio says.
The peer jury is part of the Immigrant Youth Helsinki project, which is supported by the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new ways of working are offered to all those in need, not just to young immigrants.
More Than 70 Republican Leaders Want the Party to Stop Funding Trump’s Campaign
More than 70 powerful Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the U.S. newspaper Politico, which had received a draft to see.
The letter is addressed to Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party’s money to be diverted from Trump’s campaign to Congressional elections.
“We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, along with his recklessness, incompetence, and record-breaking disapproval, threaten to bring an avalanche of votes to the Democrats in this election,” the letter said.
Only directing all possible funds to Congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning with a Trump-adorned anchor around their necks.
The letter said the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election are diminishing day by day.
Politico says the letter is due to be sent next week.
The signatories include politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organizers of the letter is prominently anti-Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
Weinstein said the letter comes from “people who want the party to protect its majorities in Congress” and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several actions by Donald Trump that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
He is also said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton pledges relief to U.S. families
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton gave details of her economic policy on Thursday night.
I'm running for president so the U.S. economy can do well for everyone.
“Donald Trump is running for president so the economy can do well for him and his friends,” Clinton said.
At the heart of the Clinton plan is a massive, $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure — roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be financed partly by tax increases for the rich, partly by private money.
The construction programme is a handshake for the American workers who suffered as factories moved to low-wage countries.
Clinton called the program the largest investment in high-paying jobs since World War II.
We are a nation of builders, we must return to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to ease the situation for working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders when he stressed that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it has to pay the exit tax,” Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he once supported.
“As president, I will oppose any trade deal that works against workers or wages,” Clinton said.
According to speculation published in The Washington Post before Clinton’s speech, Clinton was going to criticize the economic program announced by Republican Donald Trump on Monday that it “only favors millionaires like this one.”
Trump’s proposed corporate tax cut has been dubbed a “Trump loophole.”
On Thursday, Clinton said she was the daughter of a small business owner.
He reminded the audience of the small business owners whose bills Trump has not paid, and the clothes that Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
“If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making his own products in America,” Clinton said.
These are Rio’s ratings: The Games haven’t glued Finns to the screens, but I’m interested in the mobile app
Usually sports competitions appear in television viewer statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
The Olympic Games in Rio have so far not reached huge numbers of spectators.
At one time, the games have glued 12 per cent of the population to the screens: 615,000 viewers watched the Tuesday evening swim on the Yle olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
By way of comparison, the European Athletics Championships one month ago attracted almost 800,000 viewers to TV2, and the European Football Championships well over a million.
The most interesting Olympic sports so far have been Sunday night cycling and the gymnastics that opened the fifth day of the competition, both of which reached almost half a million viewers on the Olympic channel at a time.
Yle’s sports director Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the attendance figures, and reminds that for the first time in Rio Olympics, the spectators will be divided into several different instruments.
In addition to television, Finns watch the Olympics from the Rio Arena.
We are pleased with the proportion of television viewers who actually choose the Olympic Games.
Even on the television side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem.
The Rio Olympic Games are the first sports competitions to which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When a broadcast is broadcast 24 hours a day and the total number of viewers is from 20,000 to 500,000, it is a good basis.
The number of spectators is lower than at the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio's broadcasts come from Finland at night.
Another reason for the feeble interest - if anyone thinks it is feeble - is surely the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken some surprise medal from the opening competition, the interest would have bounced up with it.
In addition, athletics is just beginning, as are other sports of interest to Finns: sailing and horseback riding.
According to Pokkinen, the number of spectators at the beginning has been close to what was expected.
When athletics starts, the ratings explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the Games, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland in the first days of the Games in the Apple App Store.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I’d say we’re now at around 200,000.
"We'll get the online ratings later," Pokkinen says.
Rio Arena has not worked as expected for all users.
Pokkinen says that feedback has been received and faults have been corrected.
The use of the Rio Arena has been accompanied by delays and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
Updated versions of the applications have been received, which should correct the errors.
The Olympic Games in Rio can be seen on Yle’s canals and in the arena more than any other sporting event ever.
You can watch some sports on the Yle Fem channel, and Yle Puhe broadcasts games on the radio every day.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborious for Yle ever, but also the last, which can only be followed from Yle’s channels.
From 2018, Olympic sports will be shown on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, which is 95.3 metres deep in Riistinselkä.
It may be even deeper.
Technical dive instructor Matti Kannela found a depression of about 20 square meters in Ristiselkä, the depth of which the dive computer showed to be 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Institute tried in vain to confirm the observation by sonar scanning.
The method may not find a small recess in a hundred metres,” says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes include Lake Inari (92 metres) and Suvasvesi (90 metres).
Lake Saimaa, Lake Toisvesi and Lake Pääjärvi reach over 80 metres.
They haven't been studied as closely as the Päijänne.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been surveyed.
"There could very well be unknown depths there," Kannela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by the mean depth, it is Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
Viewed in this way, Päijänne does not make it to the top ten and Suvasvesi is even further away from the top.
Correction 12 August at 2:29 p.m.: Last paragraph corrected, where the deepest lakes at the mean depth were wrong.
Ihalainen on tax ale: Pensioner taxation still tighter
Pensioners are still taxed more heavily than wage earners.
Ihalainen says that the grievance came to light before the parliamentary elections, and the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to that of wage-earners.
The government’s proposal does not include this.
We think it should definitely be there.
The promises made should be kept after the elections, he tells Lännen Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received labour income deductions that reduced taxation.
The case heated up opposition MPs in Parliament, who scolded then-Finance Minister Alexander Stubb (ECR) for his election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
According to Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo, Ihalainen’s policy on tax cuts is mainly about safeguarding purchasing power, not increasing it, because next year wages will not be increased.
He says that the tax cut will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people’s uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with the messages from Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party) and Orpo, who want to honour the competitiveness agreement that has been achieved with great effort.
He says that keeping the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy measure of the government term.
It has been done by the labour market organisations, so it should not be ruined by questioning.
It comes in handy because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people’s own belief in the future.
Long-term unemployment must be tackled at the grassroots level
Ihalainen calls on the government to tackle long-term unemployment in the budget session, at least to stop its growth.
The number of long-term unemployed was around 17,000 higher in June than a year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government’s goal of raising the employment rate to 72% will be dashed.
He warns that if the challenge of long-term unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social bill.
Ambassador: No Finnish victims are known in the attacks in Thailand
At least four people were killed in the bombings in Thailand last night and last night.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to pay attention and avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists planning to visit Thailand should not cancel their trip due to the explosions, but the embassy’s instructions should be followed with caution, Westphalen says.
Very few people in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although it is difficult to estimate their exact number.
Finns travel to Thailand at the turn of the year.
The majority of tourists from Thailand come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Embassy of Finland has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach out especially to the Finns in Hua Hin to get information about the situation in the city.
However, many of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be going well, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
According to Westphalen, the perpetrator of the attacks has not yet been identified.
The ambassador speculates that the events may be related to the political unrest in Thailand’s divided society and last week’s referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who said they were against the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, there is an ethno-national conflict related to the Muslim population, Westphalen says.
Muslims want more self-determination.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today is a big, local holiday in Bangkok, Westphalen says.
She says the city celebrates the Queen’s birthday and Mother’s Day.
Traffic in the city is very limited.
The attacks are likely to affect the course of the day, so that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai police: Attacks are not about international terrorism
According to police, the attacks are “local sabotage” and are different from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been ruled out, Thai police said, according to the Associated Press.
At least four people have died in Thailand in the past 24 hours, with 11 bombs exploding across the country, including in tourist-friendly Phuket and Hua Hin.
Four bombs exploded in Phuket, a popular tourist destination for Finnish tourists, according to the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current information, there were no fatalities.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, injuring one person, according to the newspaper.
In Hua Hin, a popular tourist destination, four bombs were detonated yesterday and today, according to local authorities.
At least one person was killed in both double-bomb attacks.
In addition, at least one bomb went off in the village of Surat Thani and in the town of Trang in southern Thailand.
At least one person was killed in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it takes you to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The perpetrator of the attack is unknown
Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of Thailand’s ruling military junta, said the perpetrator of the attacks was not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
“We should not incite people to panic any more,” he told reporters.
Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan said that at least the Hua Hin and Trang attacks are linked.
He told the Thai BSB that the perpetrators had aimed to destroy the country’s tourism because all the attacks had taken place in tourist areas.
The Embassy of Finland urges Finns in the country to pay attention and avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns planning to travel to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to the explosions, but the Embassy’s instructions on caution should be followed, says Westphalen.
Injured Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks that took place during the Finnish night and their victims.
A little more information about last night's attack in Hua Hin.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
The injured include at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were injured in the second Hua Hin attack.
Two bombs exploded near a bell tower known as an attraction.
Thai PBS says police have sealed off an area in Hua Hin where it believes it has found another bomb.
Surat Thani's bomb was hidden in a flower bed, according to the governor of the province.
A municipal worker was killed in the attack.
At least one injured.
A police chief told CNN that two bombs were also used in the Surat Thani attack, which exploded about every half hour.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles wins women's quadruple scrimmage
Alexandra Raisman of the United States finished second with 60,098 points and Aliyah Mustafina of Russia third with 58,665 points.
Biles, 18, is still aiming for the scaffolding championships at the Rio Games with floor, jump and boom.
Biles has dominated women’s gymnastics in recent years.
He has won eight personal world championships.
He has won the four-match and floorball championships three times in a row, and the boom last year and the year before.
In the United States, Biles has won two World Team Championships.
Biles has the faintest World Cup medals in jumps and booms.
Finnish entrepreneur in Thailand: "Isku has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand, and a children’s play club in the same property, is not worried about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I don’t think there will be any more surprises,” says Huovila, who has worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen up close many of the tragedies that have affected Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then there was bird flu, and last year there was a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these haven’t driven away the tourists before, this probably hasn’t either.
The company’s office is located a few hundred metres from the site of the explosion.
Huovila heard about the attack from his own employee.
An employee called around 9:00 a.m. local time and said it's not a good idea to come to the office.
Huovila says that both the embankment and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed in the early morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought it was because of the Queen’s birthday,” Huovila said, referring to Friday’s holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and shops on the main street were allowed to open at around 10 a.m. local time.
Many on the beach had never heard of the attack.
By 2:30 a.m., the traffic in Patong had normalized, and most of the shops had opened.
Based on the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, Huovila says.
The car was later seen on the Jouxholmintie road in Kruunupyy.
When police arrived, the car was set on fire.
The patrol spotted two men matching the description, hiding in a nearby spruce forest.
The other man was caught immediately.
One escaped, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected of theft, theft and aggravated damage to a motor vehicle.
Police thank those who tipped them off.
Research Director on Russia’s leadership changes: Clear redeployment
Russia on Friday made its highest-ranking leadership change in years when President Vladimir Putin fired his head of government Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov’s successor is 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He is an ex-diplomat and served as Ivanov's second-in-command.
Kangaspuro says the reason for Ivanov’s dismissal may be Putin’s desire to prevent strong people around him from accumulating too much power.
He adds that the rotation of leadership positions is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from accumulating power independent of the President.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has gotten into trouble with other leaders or screwed up.
Drop-off for Ivanov
Ivanov, who was part of Putin’s inner circle, will take on special duties in the fields of environment and transport.
In a video broadcast by state media, Putin said the change would be a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other positions and proposed to replace him, Russia Today said.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov’s point of view, this is a clear loss of position.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high on the agenda in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most prominent people at the peak of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the Presidential Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, for example, governors, have been replaced in Russia recently.
Katri Pynn<0xC3><0xB6>niemi, a senior researcher at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, says that it is more interesting than the heir to Ivanov’s place that Putin changes his inner circle to be younger.
ISIS militants use civilians as human shield in Syria retreat
They used civilians as human shields to flee to the city of Jarabulus so we wouldn’t target them,” said Sherfan Darwish, a spokesman for the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters captured about 90 percent of the city of Manbij, which is important to ISIS.
Dozens of jihadists remained in the city.
Corrected earlier news at 7:30 p.m.: Earlier, we erroneously reported that civilians were fleeing the city, in fact, civilians were abducted by ISIS fighters while fleeing the city.
Professor: Ministry of the Interior's document disclosure policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior’s policy on public access to documents is unlawful, says Professor of Public Law Tomi Voutilainen from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells STT that public access to documents cannot be based on the authority’s own policies, but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants to Ilta-Sanomat.
The Minister justified the decision on the basis of instructions from the Prime Minister’s Office and on the grounds that the information had been recorded in the Minister’s calendar and not in accounting material.
The Ministry’s Director of Communications tells STT that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's final Olympic show begins in Rio
As in previous years, Bolt has been running against the clock.
He injured his hind legs early in the season and was forced to miss the Jamaican Olympic qualifiers.
This hasn't been perfect preparation, but I'm in much better shape.
“I’ve trained well and that’s the key thing,” Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
That press conference included scantily clad samba dancers and fan-turned-journalists.
Around Porina Bolt, it is underlined that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when athletics has struggled with doping scandals and falling interest.
Bolt's last defeat at the 2004 Olympics was in Athens, where he was eliminated in the 200-meter preliminaries with a time of 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise held back by injuries and a loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, he began his reign at the 100-meter mark, breaking the world record and the confidence of his rivals with a time of 9.69.
This is more difficult
A year later at the World Championships in Berlin, Bolt reached the pinnacle of his career.
The Berlin world records of 9.58 meters and 19.19 for 200 meters are still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a world record of 200 meters and 19 seconds, but no one but Bolt believes that it will happen.
Bolt’s biggest challenger is Athens 2004 Olympic 100 winner Justin Gatlin.
In the Beijing World Cup final last year, Bolt defeated the American by a mere one-hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has never lost in the World Cup finals, if only to make it to the top.
In Daegu 2011, Bolt missed the 100m final due to a bad start.
Bolt turns 30 in just over a week.
He is an old man in the young men’s sport, and the Rio Games will be his last Olympics.
Bolt has set next year’s World Cup in London as the final finish line of his career.
These are the Olympics that set me apart.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But whenever I’m down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Rio: Two Athletes Suspected of Doping
According to the Chinese state news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi found traces of banned substances in a doping test.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan athletics coach was sent to my home because he gave a doping test on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping test showing signs of the hormone epo.
She finished fourth in the women's 100m butterfly in Rio.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has taken his doping case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).
Xinhua said a sample of Xinyi's body on Sunday showed signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
There are also other allegations of doping in Rio.
Bulgarian female runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping test showing signs of the hormone epo.
Kenya has sent home an athletics coach from Rio for doping offences.
The International Olympic Committee said on Thursday that the Kenyan coach had posed as an athlete in a test situation and had given a doping test on his behalf.
According to media reports, this is Kenyan sprint coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used a race pass from the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotichi.
Phelps is unstoppable - historic gold became a showpiece
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swam in the 200-meter medley in his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps became the first swimmer to achieve Olympic gold in the same sport in the fourth consecutive Games.
Phelps had a winning time of 1.54.66.
Kosuke Hagino of Japan finished second before Wang Shun of China.
“I’m just trying to have a little fun,” Helen Skelton, the BBC’s Olympic swimming commentator, laughs in an instant interview with Iltalehti.
The story about Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read on this week’s Iltalehti website.
Commentary by Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn’t get a lot of stress if there’s a little noise in social media or the British press about his revealing and special outfits.
Television is a visual medium, he says.
Skelton is dressed in high-heeled shoes and a short dress that is sure to have at least enough exposure - at least to the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
However, there are no backward steps.
It’s important to look good, and small judgments are just a fun thing to do.
Skelton wants to impress, perhaps even startle, but he insists that he does not want to be in the lead role.
This is not about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus has to be on the athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the controversy has reached as far as Finland?
“I can’t, but anything that focuses on how hard these swimmers work and how much they sacrifice is okay with me,” Skelton said.
You know what, man?
It's a hassle from nowhere if it comes from (the host's) clothing.
I'm a little amused if someone's been hit by one of these.
Rio police make two arrests over suspected terrorist attack
Rio police said on Thursday that they had arrested two people on suspicion of terrorism.
The police made the arrests in connection with security surveillance of the Games.
At the same time, police made five more arrests and interrogated two people before they were released.
All the suspects were Brazilians.
According to the G1 news website, those arrested for terrorism belong to the same group whose members were already arrested by police in July.
The suspects are believed to have ties to the Islamic State group.
The detainees were known to incite violence on social media.
The calls for violence had been circulated, among other things, on the popular WhatsApp service.
At the Rio Games, 85,000 police officers are responsible for safety.
Police detonate suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria were forced to start their first round of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
The police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed it to the public.
The police let the public in after detonating the package in a controlled manner.
This is the third time during the Rio Olympics that police have carried out a controlled detonation mission.
The police closed the arena because of a suspicious package found there.
The public got in after the police had controlledly detonated the package.
The audience could not get to the auditorium by the start of the match because the police closed the arena for a while due to a suspicious package found in the hall.
The police detonated the package and let the public into the hall only after that.
The drink woke up the Spanish team, who started the games sleepily.
Spain, who started the race with two losses, won Nigeria 96-87.
In the last two races, Spain won the silver medal.
The police carried out a controlled blasting mission for the third time during the Rio Games.
The last time police had to blow up a suspicious discovery near a road cycling destination was last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started the Rio Basketball Cup in front of empty stands.
An Argentine lady pounced on Petäjä-Siren - a Finn pondered the protest
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
Wind Petäjä-Siren went through a rough patch on Thursday.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren was greeted by an Argentine lady in Rio on Thursday at the opening of the women’s surfing day.
The wind was clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the violation.
He got stuck because of the accident, and the others ran away,” Finland’s head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
The athlete thought long and hard about protesting.
It was not worth it, because it would have been useless according to the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water to get a refund,” Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn hung on his board to the last because he didn’t want to get into Rio’s dirty water.
When the car crashed, the Finn came in 27th place.
Overall, the London 2012 Olympic silver medallist is the eighth.
With regard to the tip, the accident did not have much effect.
Friday is an important day for the race from 10-12.
Edited 0.39: Contrary to the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not make a protest.
7 Strange Things That Science Says Will Lengthen Your Life
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to add years to a person’s life.
Some things are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health so that his life lengthens.
On the other hand, sometimes things that a person cannot control themselves can bring him extra years.
These include, for example, a tendency to obesity in the middle of the body or social status.
Regular shopping can extend your life.
You don't even have to spend money - just getting a milk carton is enough.
The secret of long life has been discovered in many studies.
Medical Daily reported on seven of the strangest findings.
According to science, all of these things can add years to your life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Drinking coffee has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.
A study by Harvard University found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a “reduced risk of death,” especially in the case of neurological or cardiovascular diseases.
Studies have shown that moderate consumption – one to three servings a day – can prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular flossing can extend a person’s life by up to six years, according to one study.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
This can lead to other diseases in the rest of the body.
A study conducted in Norway found out how laughter affected a person’s life span.
The seven-year project monitored more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be alive at the end of the study.
Sex, when it comes to protection against sexually transmitted diseases, is good for health, according to many studies.
In addition, it can also prolong life.
Unfortunately, just having sex is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years of life, he must also have an orgasm.
Of course, mobility will add years, there is no denying that.
However, reaching a long life does not require absolute gracefulness.
A University of Oxford study found that women with large buttocks had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega-3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality.
Whether you’re an Olympic medallist or an Oscar-winning actor, you’re more likely to live longer than a regular bun.
Many studies have tried to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that adds years to his or her life.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that a long life is due to a person's social status - which, for its part, makes it possible to seek recognition such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of the shopping behaviour of people over 65 years of age found that a person who shopped daily was likely to be a parent who shopped less often.
This is due to the fact that spinning in concrete shops reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may precipitate death.
So put your credit card down - online shopping will therefore not have the same effect.
Drunk driver crashes into truck after crashing
On Friday evening, a serious head-on collision between a truck and a passenger car took place in Koske, Southwest Finland.
The accident took place in Koske, halfway between Koskentie and Sorvastontie, on Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the car that had come to meet it had drifted into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
The truck was left in its lane after the crash, but caught fire.
The driver managed to put out the fire himself.
The car crashed into a ditch and then over the ditch onto its roof.
A woman who was born in 1972 was trapped in her car.
The rescue service removed the injured driver from the car and he was transported to the Turku University Central Hospital for treatment.
Her breath test result was 2.02 per mil.
He is suspected of aggravated drunk driving.
Postcards sent to the wrong city
There were shortcomings in Salon K-Citymarket’s bulk candy selection, because the post office had delivered some of the cargo to Seinäjoki by accident.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perni<0xC3><0xB6>, was shopping for candies at Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when she saw a funny sign.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in loose confectionery, because Posti delivered our cargo to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when Posti gets the delivery!
So unless you're busy mowing the lawn, the sign said.
The merchant’s sign is related to the fact that last spring Posti expanded its services to include grass cutting.
Grass cutting will be available at Posti until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing and decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update surprised me.
Representatives of the media have also been calling all the time, and the attention raised by this issue is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia’s update had over 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia got her own favorites in a bag of loose candy, even though a few boxes were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who is responsible for the business operations of Posti’s Corporate Transport Services, apologised for the damage to Ilta-Sanomat.
The background is that three of the five stages strayed to the wrong place yesterday (Seinäjoki) and we didn't go to make a partial delivery (Saloo) with three, but took five stages only today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanomat.
This was first reported in the evening.
Teija Halti was not upset by the sign, because she found all her own candy favourites from the selection.
30 kg lighter Lotta Backlund published a photo of her change
The comedian-producer has lost dozens of pounds since the birth of her baby.
Lotta Backlund has lost dozens of pounds as a result of the change in her life.
Lotta shared a couple of photos of her change on Instagram on Friday.
In the spring, Lotta was on a fitness course and aimed for a normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014
Comedian and TV producer Lotta Backlund started her weight loss project already in 2009.
She has undergone a comprehensive lifestyle change and gradually lost about thirty kilograms.
On Friday, Backlund posted a pair of photos of her stunning performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed over the years.
Backlund’s Before and After photo pair has gathered many compliments from fellow dieters.
You're gorgeous.
We’re on the same journey, motivation is hard!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Let's Do It Now project.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures when I’m on my way,” says another.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last kilos while working on the Let's Do It Now project.
At the time, he told Iltalehti that he wanted to finally reach a normal weight, which at that time was ten kilograms.
Over the course of three months, five kilos were lost.
The family of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Commemorations of the victim for the benefit of police dogs
The family of a 42-year-old woman murdered a week ago in Loviisa hopes that the victim will be remembered not with flowers and petitions, but with a donation for police dog work.
Sipoo Veterinary Centre has published a Facebook post in which it conveys the wishes of the victim’s family for donations for the benefit of police dogs.
The publication says that the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipoo Veterinary Station and had also completed her nurse training there.
The veterinary clinic remembers the woman with words that touch her.
Happy, smart, humorous and fearless.
My good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that all donations go to police dogs, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old woman from Loviisa was murdered in her own home yard in Loviisa, Koskenkylä.
The woman’s neighbors told the newspaper that the victim was very fond of animals.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens, and a rooster.
The 27-year-old man did not know the woman and had no connection with her.
Police dog B<0xC3><0xB6>rje was involved in the tracking of the killer, who was fatally wounded in the arrest.
B<0xC3><0xB6>rje, however, survived and is recovering.
The District Court issued a judgment against Posti for violation of the Non-Discrimination Act
Posti was not entitled to withhold the salary of an employee who refused to provide orientation for a temporary agency worker, the Kanta-Häme district court assessed in its judgment.
The district court ordered Posti to pay the employee most of the wages withheld and EUR 2,000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only a part of the instructor’s salary that corresponded to the part of the induction work during the whole day.
According to the District Court, contrary to the Non-Discrimination Act, an employee was placed in a less favourable position on the basis of trade union activities.
The employee had complied with PAU’s organisational decision on the ban on orientation.
During the postal strike in November last year, PAU made a decision according to which Posti’s employees do not familiarise rental workers who violate the strike.
This was first reported in the People's News.
Turkey must return to a path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic development that respects human rights, Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (Centre Party) wrote in their response to the Federation of Journalists.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party) and Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (PS) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
The Union of Journalists has previously asked Sipilä and Soini to express their concern for freedom of speech and freedom of the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland has repeatedly highlighted to Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and freedom of speech.
Putin Fires Head of Administration, Replaced by Persecution of Estonian Origin
Russian President Vladimir Putin has sacked the head of the Russian presidential administration, Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin said.
It will be replaced by Anton Vaino, grandson of Soviet Estonian Communist leader Karl Vaino.
Vaino is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as the deputy head of the presidential administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, the Interfax news agency reports.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his government.
According to a Kremlin statement, Ivanov, who was a close member of Putin’s inner circle, will take on special tasks related to the environment and transport.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other positions and proposed to replace him, Russia Today reports.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era on spying for the KGB.
Ivanov was seen by many as a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed to the post in 2011, ahead of Putin’s re-election in 2012.
BBC: ManU's massive acquisition of a ban - will not be seen in Premier League opening
The world record for football transfers will not be seen on the pitch when the Premier League kicks off this weekend.
Paul Pogba was banned from playing in England.
Manchester United's Paul Pogba has been suspended from playing for Manchester United as the club opens its season against Bournemouth on Sunday, the BBC said on Friday.
ManU paid Juventus €105 million for Pogba, according to British media.
However, the FA keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was suspended from Juventus.
He received two warnings last season in the Italian Cup and will be suspended for one game.
That ban has been moved to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next match will be in the League's second round on 19 August, when ManU will face Southampton.
In Flow, megalomania is a virtue
Precise criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established Flow Festival’s status as an internationally acclaimed event starring the world’s top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festivalgoers have typically expressed themselves in distinctive dress.
One of the main stage artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
Flow Festival’s event area is styled with artificial turf and art installations.
It has never been enough for us to have only a main stage and a beer tent, says the artistic director of the event Tuomas Kallio.
Flow Festival, held in Suvilahti, Helsinki this weekend, has grown from a small block festival to an event for tens of thousands of visitors.
Behind the success lies a simple question: What kind of event would the authors themselves like to go to?
It is quite different in event productions to think this way.
Often, the goal is to reach the level of necessity and act in accordance with official regulations, says the artistic director of the event Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was going to sell out again this year.
The goal was to increase the number of visitors by 5,000 last year’s 70,000 people.
This year, the festival hosts a number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists.
An increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because the activities must be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle guided by huge avenues.
We don't want that.
For 13 years, the ideology of the successful event has been inflated to include 130 performers, art installations, numerous restaurant points and drink bars in the area, partly decorated with artificial grass.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stages, this year there will be a tent for 15,000 people.
I agree that the event could be done more simply.
Maybe I'm a little megalomaniac, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve Flow's spirit.
If you lose it, this isn't our thing anymore.
For Kallio, the greatest joy and reward for the work done is that nowadays even great visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event, in the mid-2000s, operations were highly dependent on the City of Helsinki’s support of approximately EUR 20,000.
Last year, the turnover of the limited liability company operating Flow was approximately EUR 6 million.
It can be used to produce “crazy things,” such as the construction of that 73-meter-wide tent.
Flow’s visitors have typically expressed themselves with a distinctive dress code.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about a trendy community of young adults.
The event, however, has not been consciously profiled as particularly fashionable.
Above all, we want to stand out with content.
Yet, fashion also fits Flow’s values: curiosity and a desire to interact with the environment,” says Kallio.
This year, one of the artists on the main stage is the legend of punk, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
He has a huge fan base in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer at a festival that combines indie rock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time this will be seen at a gig in Finland.
We're interested in everything, history and the future.
It's not just what's on the commercial radio.
Iggy’s latest album is damn good and she’s done damn good gigs in the last few years.
Thailand’s tourist parade bombs were hidden in flower pots – tourists fled in terror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flowerpot and detonated using mobile phones.
The bombs were placed on a street where most of the customers are foreigners.
They were detonated at the same time as tourists began leaving the bars and returning to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumran told CNN.
Edwin Wiek, a wildlife protector who has lived in Asia since 1989, tweeted a telling image of the attacks.
If you can't see the tweet, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of the injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran up to me and said that a bomb had gone off at the bars.
It happened on one of the biggest bar streets, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of injured is not yet known.
Shortly after that, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, which was also popular among the Finns.
As far as we know, no one died.
A second double bomb attack was also carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one person was killed and three were injured.
In addition, one bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police said they had found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely to be insurgents behind the bombings, who are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently seized on the activities of criminal organisations that traffic in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new readiness forces will first go into battle in a war situation
In an acute war situation, conscripts are ordered to combat only after several months of taking the military oath, says Keskisuomalainen.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, the Chief of Training of the Finnish Defence Forces, who was interviewed by the newspaper, only those conscripts who are in the final stages of their training are eligible for combat if they serve for 5.5 months in a war situation.
According to the Head of Training, reserve members of the response forces are first recruited.
No conscript or reservist is ordered to perform a task that has not been given the required training, Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Finnish Defence Forces will begin training conscripts in immediate readiness units from next year.
If necessary, units can be used in military operations already during conscript training.
Pamela Tola received huge compensation from the mould house
Actress Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a major dispute over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of the two-storey detached house had been EUR 330,000.
After the sale, however, a serious moisture problem was discovered in the house, which caused a microbial growth that was dangerous to health.
The couple had to sell their home in 2014.
The sale price had fallen to EUR 132,000, which resulted in a financial loss of no less than EUR 198,000 for Tola and Waroma.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the district court and the court of appeal.
The court handed down its judgment on Wednesday.
It upheld the judgment of the district court ordering the seller to pay a price reduction of EUR 150 000 to Tola and Waroma.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 344 in court and settlement costs.
The right to a reasonable price reduction slightly because the buyers had been aware of the need to repair the apartment already at the time of the sale.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the construction defects that had appeared were substantially more serious than had been presented.
Tola was looking for a good home
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically been looking for a home in good condition because they did not want to undertake repair work.
He had the impression that the building had been renovated and in good condition, and that there was no harm in the matters mentioned in the condition inspection report.
The condition inspection report mentioned the risks and shortcomings of ventilation and the fact that the management of rain and melting water flowing along the rock surface is not sufficient.
However, the discussions did not indicate that there was any urgency.
Tola and Waroma were left with the idea that the rainwater coming from the rock should perhaps be controlled a little in a few years.
The transaction was completed in October 2009.
Within a few years, it turned out that the moisture problems in the apartment were much more serious than expected.
Inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 revealed microbial growth in the building, which, according to witnesses, were caused by both the rainwater in the rock and the capillary increase in soil moisture.
According to the inspector’s assessment, air contaminated by microbes on the west side of the house could also enter the interior through the porch.
Mould or yeast that exceeded the limit values and enabled a health risk were found in the laundry room, basement staircase, living room window heater and basement washroom.
Terraces were built without permits
The court also questioned whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The court found that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo to make changes to the apartment contrary to the permit before the transaction.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, although there were no proper permits yet.
However, mold problems were a central issue in court.
According to the Court of Appeal, buyers could, on the basis of the information they had received from the seller before the sale, assume that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no immediate need for major repairs.
In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, Tola and Waroma had no particular reason to carry out a more extensive inspection than usual.
Buyers have not failed to comply with their obligation to provide information, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children to Nazis – including Finns in the register
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in a recent Dagens Nyheter article that the U.S. National Archives in Maryland has microfilmed documents about a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also American, French, Dutch and Russian women.
At least 65 Danes, 86 Norwegians and 14 Finns as well as 31 Swedish women wanted to be a Nazi bride.
The documents and registration cards are from a breed agency in Nazi Germany.
The Office was under the command of SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he was examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true even more so for women who had to be able to bear more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were subjected to gynecological examinations to investigate the matter.
The Office investigated women’s backgrounds, for example, by examining church records.
The purpose was to make sure that there were no Jews in the women's pedigree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and hand over handwritten biographies and good recommendations from loved ones to the breed bureau.
The Office wanted guarantees that women were "child-loving," "sparing," and "good National Socialists" who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as brides for SS men.
The story does not say what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
The SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that every SS man should have four children, whether married or not.
Lebensborn homes look after children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not actively promoted, according to the website of the American Holocaust Museum.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on the family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by offering loans and supported the birth of children.
The German Mother’s Cross of Honor was awarded to women who had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum said.
Petäjä-Siren sixth, Nirkko got up and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third in the first start of the Finnjolls’ day at the Rio Olympics, but he was left with the best of luck at the second start of the day.
Weird finished eighth after five starts, but the failure of the second put him in 14th place.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren fought 17th and 3rd places in the RS:X class day.
In total, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In the 470 class Joonas and Niklas Lindgren were 23rd in the opening race of the day.
The Lindgrens are ranked 19th overall.
Jari Sillanpää's Satulinna was recorded with a couple of hours of sleep: "I was so hungover"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of Finland’s favourite artists for over 20 years.
Sillanpää, the bartender of the cruise ship, became the Tango King of 1995, Finland’s best-selling solo artist, and the star of dance stages and festivals, is still on the rise.
The book Jari Sillanpää - Paljaana, written by Mari Koppinen and about the life of the favourite singer, was published today on Thursday.
In the book, Sillanpää talks about his life and career in both good and bad.
Sillanpää’s career took off when he won the Tango King’s crown at the Seinäjoki Tango Market in 1995.
Sillanpää sang tangos in the competition, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango piece for Sillanpää at his request, which Kassu Halonen arranged in a slightly different form.
Satulinna became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so hungover!
The bridge reminds me of the book.
From the recording of the song, which has become a huge hit, one would not immediately guess that it was sung in a hangover.
Even though I wasn’t physically at my best, the track was still good.
I learned that you don’t always have to demand perfection and excellence from yourself.
Another incident involving the man’s most popular songs, described in the book, occurred nearly twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his then-partner and the case eventually ended with the lyrics of the song “You deserve gold”, which was released as a single in 2014.
According to the book, the lyrics ordered from Saara T<0xC3><0xB6>rmänen were not what Sillanpää would have wanted.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making an album that would tell a true story about his life, but the words to the song about the divorce were not true, but it was written based on the news of the 7 Days magazine.
In the newspaper’s news, the reason for Jari’s and his ex-lover’s breakup was excessive partying and alcohol consumption, but Jari said it was complete nonsense and not true.
According to the book, Jari called the record company in a rage and refused to sing the song, but ended up singing it anyway - and that's fine.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters were in favour of leaving and 48% would have stayed in the Union, even though polls during voting week predicted the opposite.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in their support of remaining in the EU.
Not a single respected research institute or university flagged for the difference, even though a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The slogan of former US President Bill Clinton’s recent election campaign, “It’s the economy, stupid,” was thrown into the dustbin by Britain’s Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Curly language (economics)
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics asks the industry for answers to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economists were not listened to, because this time the voters made the decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation for the loss of economic status among economists is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the illusion that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in employment, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's for the real Brit.
Many also have the impression that a fall in the value of a currency would be a good thing, because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the economists, the voters did not believe the economic arguments, because the consensus of economists did not come out sufficiently.
They were particularly struck by the BBC's neutrality, which gave as much room to economists who were in favour of leaving the EU as to the overwhelming majority, representing only a few per cent of the economy.
The EU-hostile press was not interested in telling what the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other capital combinations of the economy thought about the consequences of the separation.
Those distant letter combinations spoke facelessly about economic growth, trade relations, sovereign debt, and currency.
And if the economists’ messages were both listened to and understood, they were ignored because economists represent an elite with whom, in their opinion, the voters do not share common interests.
Academics in big cities, such as economists, would have remained in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas, the message was not effective.
Immigration is an economy.
The overwhelming argument for victory in the Brexit vote was immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant congests your hospital, an immigrant takes advantage of you.
These arguments work.
There are foreign workers in every cafe.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
You can see immigrants in the waiting room of every health centre.
How much easier would it be to get a doctor's appointment if it weren't for them?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for real British children to get a place in school if they got rid of them?
Foreigners live in every municipality.
How much more space would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
Economists, however, failed to respond and, if they did, their answers were not given any visibility.
Economists failed to explain that thanks to immigrants, Britons have more jobs, fewer waiting lists, and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and EU migrants in particular - are net contributors to Britain's public finances and their spending creates jobs.
Aberdeen real estate fund prepared for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Pertti Vanhanen from Finland.
In Aberdeen, he said, preparations for Brexit were made in good time by drawing up plans A and B.
A few weeks before the vote, more detailed preparations were made for Plan B, the victory of the camp in favour of leaving the EU, in case the result would be a leave.
The concern was that investors would begin to withdraw their funds from the market.
Real estate funds do not normally have large amounts of liquid assets, but they could be needed now.
We started to raise cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd, we had 25 percent of the fund’s investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says of Aberdeen’s only open daily-quoted real estate fund that was covered by the news.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20 percent.
The fund was worth <0xC2><0xA3>3.5 billion at the time.
The total value of the company’s funds is approximately <0xC2><0xA3>20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open-ended real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all open-ended real estate funds in the UK.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained at 10% or even below.
Real estate funds prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
The funds shut down trading.
When the pro-divorce camp won, Europe went awry.
However, the two weeks that followed the voting in the real estate market were quite calm, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first real estate fund, Standard Life, froze its trading.
Together, they brought the situation to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
Snowball began to spin, and one fund after another had to close its doors.
Aberdeen was in a good position due to the cash raised, but was also forced to freeze its trade for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close the trade, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether they should now pull the money out in a panic.
Aberdeen’s message was that if you are not forced to take your money out now, it is not worth it, as it would result in losses.
It calmed things down, and most of them withdrew the notification.
Since then, it has been fairly steady, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, Vanhanen says.
He points out that, for example, there has been no similar upheaval in Aberdeen’s continental European funds.
However, there were a lot of questions.
Unnecessary attention to real estate funds
According to Vanhanen, the closures of real estate funds received undue attention.
The open-ended funds affected by the closures control around four per cent of UK property.
The Aberdeen lockdown lasted six days and the company sold less than ten of its 80 properties in London.
Other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned investors this week that it might keep its fund closed for 2017.
At the moment there is uncertainty in the air and economic growth forecasts have been slashed, but the situation does not look "more timid" from Aberdeen's point of view.
The main questions now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities for some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The pound-dollar exchange rate is at its lowest level in 30 years, and there is a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30 percent cheaper.
There are a lot of willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit brings downsides to London real estate market
At two in the morning, the situation did not look very good.
But at four o’clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, who is in charge of real estate investments at the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the word for it.
I realized that this now goes to Plan B,” Vanhanen says in his second home in Helsinki.
He immediately went to work.
The City of London was already fully alive in the early hours of the morning.
TV screens, normally muted at the office, greeted the news, and usually the loud crowd was completely silent when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to announce his resignation.
When the market opened, the display terminals flashed only red.
It was the kind of morning you never thought you’d live,” Vanhanen says.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain’s largest real estate funds, finalized two real estate deals the day after the Brexit vote.
The mood was confusing.
However, the company had prepared well for the alternative, which is why the situation was kind of calm,” Vanhanen says.
The Brexit vote has begun
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership went on exchange.
The market began to anticipate sharp declines in the UK real estate market, especially in London.
The London office space was projected to be down by up to 20 percent in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trading one after another.
Aberdeen did the same for six days.
Now the storm has subsided, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it doesn't show on the face of Vanhanen, who spent his last days of summer holiday in Helsinki this week.
It is far too early to say much about Brexit.
So much remains to be done: how will the separation take place and how will Scotland react to the situation, for example.
Initial data on the development of the London property market have already been obtained.
The real estate services company CBRE’s data on price development covers about one third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
The City of London’s office buildings accounted for 6.1 per cent of the negative, Vanhanen says.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have been worse, Vanhanen says.
All of the same falls occurred in the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is also interesting because Brexit was quickly compared to Lehman’s downfall and the global economic crisis that began in the US real estate market.
Mr Vanhanen said that the comparison is not entirely accurate, as this is now a home-grown crisis in Britain.
The mood is different.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales like that at the time, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, Vanhanen says.
Funding is normally available.
The repair could have been done anyway.
In fact, a price correction is no surprise to him – it could have happened without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that real estate prices in London and other top cities in the world have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years now that City and especially the offices are overpriced,” Vanhanen says.
The fall started really high.
London prices have risen for four reasons, according to Vanhanen’s list.
The British economy has grown strongly, as has the population of London.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last ownership category that is globalizing, Vanhanen says.
New players from the Middle East and Asia have entered the market, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which have forced pension companies, for example, to look for returns on new assets.
On top of this, loans have been readily available - although, according to Vanhanen, the leverage has now been clearly less than during the pre-crisis boom of 2008.
Distribute, Distribute
In London, the rise in prices levelled off last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen also began to lighten its holdings in London, and last year was a net seller.
There was some kind of twist to be expected, and now it has come.
What's next?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhanen says.
Not much he dares to estimate, but he says that there is hardly any upswing.
The mood indicates that there is a downward or even trend ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen several moves up and down, as he has been in the real estate industry since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that you can work your way out of a hole.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in decentralization.
If you invest in one market, you are too much of a victim.
If it is decentralized, the risks are also decentralized, Vanhanen says.
S Group starts to register purchase data more accurately than before
Soon, S Group will know what you are eating, as the trading group announced today that it will begin to collect more detailed information on its regular customers’ purchases.
After collecting data on the total amount of the receipt so far, the group will start collecting it at the beginning of May also from the purchased products.
S Group will follow Kesko in this, as information on goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years already.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data is collected with the customer’s consent and used for marketing purposes subject to authorisation.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have banned the use of product information, says Riitala to Taloussanomat.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to the S Group's registration change.
Kesko already categorises its regular customers into ten groups based on food purchases alone.
The classification is updated monthly.
Loyalty customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for customer-oriented marketing.
Product-specific purchase data is collected only from K Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty programme and is not currently planning one.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own Ykk<0xC3><0xB6>sbonus loyalty programme, which can be joined at Valintatalo, Siwoi and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect product- or group-level information, we will keep to the total amount of the receipt.
That is, we know in which store the purchases were made and on what day and the total amount of the customer’s receipt.
We have not gone to that level like K Group or S Group,” says Commercial Director Anu Ora.
According to him, the loyalty programme will be renewed in the future, but Lähikauppa will tell about it later.
However, Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
Initially, the experiment
SOK’s co-op member and customer register has been relatively extensive so far.
In addition to personal data and address data, basic data have also included occupation, education, type of residence, and the years of birth and previous personal data of children.
People in the same household and their roles are also registered.
The S-Etukortti card purchase records the date and time of purchase, place, total amount of purchases and payment method.
In addition, the S-bonus partners’ information has been obtained from their cashier systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
In S-markets, Prisms, Kodin Terroi and ABC chains, however, the data are recorded at the product group level for the time being.
For some time now, customers have been hoping that marketing could be targeted more precisely, says Marjaana Saarikoski, SOK’s Head of Co-op and Partner Operations.
S Group says it will inform its customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific data for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored in the cash registers anyway, whether you like it or not.
You can check your stored data on the S Group website.
For example, cashiers do not have access to the data, Saarikoski emphasises.
Video: Heila-puppy is the newest dog confirmed by Customs - Puppy will be the first explosive dog
Black Labrador puppy sniffs vigorously five similar boxes lined up on the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It won’t be long before it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog for playing with his favourite toy.
In the box next to which Heila was sitting, a jar of cartridges reeking of gunpowder gas was discovered.
Gunpowder gas is the first smell that has been practised with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and e-commerce main reasons
Heila is Customs’ first dog specialising in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed at Helsinki Airport next year.
If necessary, work assignments may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossing points and ports.
However, the airport will be Heila’s main workplace, as the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused measures at Customs, and after the attacks, surveillance has been strengthened, says Mikko Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nberg, Senior Officer at Customs.
Another main reason for training a gun and explosive dog in Customs’ duties is postal deliveries via Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the increased internet sales, as many as 40 million postal items pass through the airport each year, which may include weapons and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made around 300 discoveries at Helsinki Airport related to weapons, weapons parts, ammunition and explosives and their precursors among online purchases, luggage of passenger aircraft and air freight.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It will examine checked baggage and mail.
In ports, it will be of great benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nberg.
Based on Heila’s performance, Customs will assess whether more weapon and explosive dogs will be trained in the future.
Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nberg is optimistic about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
Heila-puppy training is coordinated by Customs dog school in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio and Heila will also attend training sessions with the police and Defence Forces experts.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Finnish Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, will decide what smells Heila will be taught to recognise.
Heila is always further trained as needed, says Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nberg.
Heila’s colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Customs’ six drug dogs and the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador Retriever Heila has been selected from a litter of ten puppies.
The criteria for choosing a dog at the airport include cheerfulness and hunting instincts, as well as calmness, because the dog is involved with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives in Suntio’s home, is a close colleague of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can’t get anywhere at home without Heila, Suntio laughs.
Subtle orders go to Heila once and for all.
The cameraman of Ilta-Sanomat loses the mic cover of the camera to the fast dog, but Heila returns the mic cover, which looks like a soft toy, immediately after the "disconnect" command.
Tough competition for working dogs
Heila’s initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next in October, to assess whether the training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heila can be seen working at Helsinki Airport next year, if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers are not allowed to iron a dog wearing a work vest, Suntio reminds.
The cost of one working dog to Customs is approximately 60000-70000 euros per year.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire in the care of their owner.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active work sessions only last from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
Working dogs are in fierce competition at Customs.
About 20-30 Customs employees applied for ownership of Heila.
She was lucky to meet Suntio, who has never had a working dog before, but she has years of experience in dogs and surveillance duties at Customs.
Mini-state gets its first Olympic medal – people get a day off
With a population of less than one million, Fiji’s Olympic gold in rugby is so highly valued in the country that the government has designated 22 August as a national holiday.
The Fijian government confirmed the case after the championship was decided.
The day off is the day after the team returns home.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
The Fijian rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country watched the final in the capital Suva, where a screen had been set up for the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even the Chinese restaurants were watching the game, I heard them cheering, said Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru to the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - a Finnish buyer fainted after a wild performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola made his last attempt at 175 kilos after a hard fight.
Tokola is a special and life-threatening feature for a lifter.
During, or immediately after, severe withdrawals, he has fainted many times.
No one has really been able to say why.
Tokola gained 175 kilos from the push and 145 kilos from the rally in Rio.
His total score was 320 kilos.
Tokola tried to push 175 kilos last time, as did the other one.
On the third attempt, the weights rose accompanied by fierce roaring.
The body shook under the weights until the jury approved the lift.
The Finnish buyer’s joy was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquires Estonian forward Prosa - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
Rovaniemi Palloseura, who plays in the men’s football league, has signed an agreement with Estonian forward Albert Prosa that will last until the end of the season.
We are looking for a top player in our team who has power and whose threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
We went through over 50 players from all over the world with more than ten players agents.
Gradually, Prosa started to stand out as a good option,” RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flora, Tallinn, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 games.
He also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is scheduled to be with RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where Rovaniemi residents will meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new striker when last season’s land king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
Proud Modern Family Star Shrugs Again: Teen Star’s Shorts Reveal Almost Everything
Ariel Winter, who is known as Alex Dunphy from the Modern Family comedy series, once again shows off her voluptuous body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs, but also his buttocks.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and behavior to be much bolder.
She has posed for pictures on social media in very few clothes and has had numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very scanty outfits.
Winter, who is on the verge of adulthood, has also recently published several pictures of herself celebrating.
If you don't see it, you can watch it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his public image so radically.
Amy Palmer, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, suspected that Winter was undergoing a “typical Hollywood transformation” from child star to adult.
He has been on television his entire life and has grown up in the Kardashian era.
He’s learned that the more exposed the surface looks, the more publicity and attention Hollywood gets,” Palmer told Fox News, adding that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter first appeared in the Modern Family series at the age of 11.
The actor has angered some of his longtime fans with his image change.
It’s not hard to guess where she’ll be in ten years, when the downhill is already so hard, says one woman on Winter’s Instagram.
Some of her fans, on the other hand, defend the actress and urge her to ignore the criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what anyone says.
You are an inspiration to many women, says the young woman.
The Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted by the Northern Lights: In autumn, it is possible to see the fairytale-like mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to encourage the Japanese to start their aurora borealis journeys already in the early autumn, says Visit Finland.
The main destinations of the Japanese northern lights are Inari and Levi.
The Northern Lights are the trump card of our winter travel, and they are strongly associated with the heart of winter and snowy landscapes.
There is a great demand for Lapland’s winter aurora borealis trips, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Lights season starts early in the autumn and continues well into spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the Northern Lights, making the sight twice as fairytale-like, says Visit Finland’s Acting Marketing Manager Anne Lind.
The main target group of Visit Finland’s Northern Lights campaign are wealthy 25-35-year-old Japanese women living in the city, who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, for example, through online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the Universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
The Japanese, however, would like to see more unique sights from Finland, and this is where the Northern Lights have huge potential, according to Lind.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists have grown clearly more in Finland than in the other Nordic countries.
Last year, they spent more than double the number of nights in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
From the point of view of Finnish tourism, the Japanese are an interesting target group, as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain settles for rugby silver while Fid’s masterclass leads to gold
Britain’s impressive progress in the rugby tournament collapsed to Fiji’s final challenge in the final on Thursday night, as the team experienced a 43-7 crushing defeat at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji held a master class in handling, chewing, dodging, support game, running lines and sheer force while winning gold – their first Olympic medal.
With the loss came a reasonable consolation for the silver medal – the third of Britain’s day – and they were able to take pride in their hard work in the Olympic Rugby inaugural tournament, where they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A strong 7-5 victory from South Africa in the semi-finals played earlier that day may have bothered them.
Despite this, Fidi would have won a top-ranked team of 15.
Britain may, but probably won’t, be comforted by the fact that at least one Briton will have a gold medal tomorrow: Fidi’s head coach is Ben Ryan, England’s former boss from Wimbledon.
The trip to Great Britain has been quite a journey.
Eight years ago, they, coached by Ryan, lost every game at the Adelaide tournament.
Here, they only lost one.
This beating hurts, but the development is startling.
Fidi started off superbly fighting British tackles for fun.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, it was as if they were running towards buses, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinsau dived in the corner to the finish area.
With four minutes left on the clock, Jerry Tuwai's second touchdown on the right led to a goal kick.
12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant tackle stopped the man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third goal, but it was only a drag on Fid.
At seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored in the right corner, with the UK losing 17-0.
Nakarawa scored another start, and there was still more than a minute left on the clock...the first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvouvou plunged through the loose tackles of Great Britain and rushed to the line to score.
After the penalty shootout, the situation was 29-0.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while the UK was just learning the game.
And that's actually the way it is.
Great Britain made bulk changes during the break that blocked the Fidi dam... for a full four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until Josua Tuisova scored after Fidi's impressive pass game.
Dan Norton scored for Great Britain, scoring a touchdown in the left corner and narrowing it down to 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the South Sea islanders, whose supporters sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was hard not to admire Fid’s jubilant approach.
Mata Viliame with her last minute paint had frosting on Fidi's cake, which didn't need frosting.
Whistles whistled, Fijians hugged, and Great Britain fell on the grass, completely defeated.
Earlier that day, Fidi had beaten Japan 20–5 in the semi-finals, and Britain beat South Africa in the tight semi-finals, where each scored one goal - Britain's goal kick was the deciding factor.
Kyle Brown led South Africa in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with a dazzling footwork and scored under the goalposts in the second half.
A spectacular late tackle from Marcus Watson, brother of England’s 15-aside rugby team Anthony, secured the win and ultimately the silver medal.
Coach’s fight against cancer spurred Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to row
There will be no gold in these races more emotional than that, and that really means something.
From the first stroke to the last, 220 hard-hitting thrusts toward the history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they rowed alone, there were three voices on the boat. Coach Robin Williams' echo was present all the time, as the two raced for their second consecutive Olympic gold medal in the women's doubles - the first women in British sports history books to reach such an achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance invincible, which is also a record.
This, what we see, two brilliant athletes juggling on the surface with the grace of a swan, does not fully reflect the nature of victory.
Behind every rowing gold is a group of helpful pairs of hands that gradually advance the things that matter. And no pair of hands was as essential as that of a coach who, 30 months ago, after being diagnosed with cancer, didn’t know if he would live to this day.
Like he said, it was close.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be operated on, and they performed the surgery.
If they don't cut it, it'll spread everywhere.
It could have been pretty bad.
It changes your thinking a bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky to be able to start their treatment at the beginning of 2014 outside of the season, when they caused as little disruption as possible – if that expression could ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better fast.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and walking around the ward — 20, 30, 50 feet at a time — when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing in itself is a journey, but it makes it a bit bigger.
Immediately after the win, Williams, who had had a nervous morning, was the first couple to think, and he had talked a little more than usual, trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, an experienced captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment of Afghanistan, said: “I’ve been in a tundra wreck this week, which may be a bit of an overreaction, but this means so much to me.”
It just underscores how important this is to me, how hard me and Helen, and Robin too, have worked.
The last three years with Helen and Robin have been amazing.
Without Robin, we would be nothing, so he is the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t think of a better coach or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The pair set a heavy rhythm that their rivals could not match.
Even in the last 500 metres, as teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in store.
We were very caught up in the moment.
Helen shouted, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It is very important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we did not try to do anything special.
We weren’t looking for fireworks today, we were just looking for good rowing and winning the race, and that’s what we did.
A couple waits a year before deciding on their future.
Glover will attend the wedding next month when she marries Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say it was my last race.
It would have put too much pressure.
After London, it took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
“It feels so much better,” he said.
Iceland to change government after Panama leaks
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which protesters, angered by Panama leaks, called for in the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that a number of Icelandic politicians evaded taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but that was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election date has now been set for October 29.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the popular outrage last spring will affect the election results in the autumn.
In the June presidential elections, the critical attitude towards those in power was clearly visible, and Gudni Johannesson, a non-political candidate, was elected president.
Trump says he was sarcastic when he accused Obama of being the founder of ISIS
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump retracted his latest rant.
He said he was being sarcastic when he claimed that President-elect Barack Obama was involved in the founding of the terrorist organization ISIS and that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was also involved in the founding of the organization.
The Democratic Party was outraged by the remarks and demanded an apology from Trump.
No one should ever be allowed to become the commander-in-chief of an army who can sink so low.
In the south of France, the mayor of Cannes has banned Muslims from wearing burkini swimwear on beaches, according to the Guardian.
The resolution, signed by Mayor David Lisnard, states that access to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not have a bathing suit that respects good manners and secularism.
The decision also says that swimsuits, which show a high degree of religious affiliation, may increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating French National Day.
In late July, two men linked to the Islamic State group attacked a church in northern France and killed an 80-year-old priest.
The quality of bathing waters in the Oulu region passed the screening - Blue-green algal haze in Pyyk<0xC3><0xB6>sjärvi
The water samples taken from the official bathing areas in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements set for bathing water.
Only blue-green algae turbidity has been observed at the Pyyk<0xC3><0xB6>sjärvi beach.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region’s Environment Department took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public beaches in the Oulu Region.
With the exception of Meriniemi beach, the concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococci in all bathing waters were below the action limits set in the decrees of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and enterococci concentrations in Meriniemi beach water were confirmed on Wednesday, when the bacterial concentrations had fallen below the action limits.
The blue-green algal bloom observed at the Pyyk<0xC3><0xB6>sjärvi beach does not yet make the water unsuitable for swimming, but in favourable conditions the situation can quickly change to blue-green algal bloom, when blue-green algal mass forms on the surface of the water as rafts.
The environmental action will monitor the situation through intensified inspections.
If the blue-green algae clouding turns into blue-green algae bloom, this will also be announced separately on the beach information board.
See the results of bathing water samples here.
MTK’s Hakkarainen on forest gift reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside
The forest gift deduction is one tax change in the Ministry of Finance’s budget proposal for next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax deduction that would be granted on the basis of gift tax.
The Ministry of Finance’s proposal for forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote the generational changes of forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest holdings and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry’s objective is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
A forest owner would make a deduction from forestry’s pure capital income.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote generational renewal of forest holdings is good,” says Juha Hakkarainen, Director of Forestry at the Federation of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners (MTK).
However, there is some criticism of the tax reform proposal.
A forest gift deduction is proposed from the forest owner’s pure capital income.
It is capital income from which all other deductions have been deducted.
According to MTK and Hakkarainen, the tax deduction would be more effective if the deduction could be made directly from the sales revenue of the timber.
The Ministry of Finance’s proposal is based on the premise that by making a deduction from forestry’s pure capital income, the loss of forestry’s capital income would be prevented on the basis of the deduction, which would be deducted in other taxation.
Such a person would receive a tax benefit even if he did not sell the tree.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner is unable to perceive it, says Hakkarainen.
The model also applies to only a small number of forest owners.
The tax deduction limit linked to the yield value of the forest is EUR 40,000 in the proposal.
It has been pulled too high in the opinion of Hakkarainen.
As such, it removes 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners from the scope of the deduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10 per cent of forest owners, he says.
According to the Ministry of Finance, the border guarantees the goal of increasing the farm size.
According to Hakkarainen, forest policy has been reducing forest gifts for decades.
This is due to the ageing of forest owners.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60, and about half of the forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful hailstorm surprised motorists in Himanka - two cars plunged into a ditch and collided with each other
There was a strange chase in the Himanka of Kalajoki on Friday morning.
According to the rescue services, two cars that had driven in a row ended up in a ditch, after which the one behind collided with the one behind.
According to the on-call fire marshal Harri Pyyhtyä, it is suspected that the fall into the ditch was caused by a strong hailstone.
There were two people in the back of the car, both of whom were taken to the hospital for treatment.
There is no specific information about their injuries.
The driver of the car was not injured.
The accident happened on highway 8 from Himanka to Kalajoki, a few kilometres away.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
New research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help develop cancer treatments to be even more effective.
The findings made by Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska’s research group show that the hardness of a cancerous tumor increases the malignancy of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow normally in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of the cancer could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer therapies may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells.
The results of the study have been published on August 4 in the prestigious journal Nature Communications in the field of cell biology.
Muhos’s family home murder continues to be discussed at the court, prosecutor also demands a murder sentence for another perpetrator
The murder of the Muhos family home continues at the court for both convicted offenders.
In June, two young men were sentenced to prison for the murder of a family home in Muhos.
One was given 8 years and 4 months for, among other things, manslaughter as a young person and aggravated robbery.
The second is sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
A person convicted of manslaughter was also convicted of aggravated endangerment of traffic safety as a young person and of driving a vehicle without a right as a young person.
The district court’s decision was appealed by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs and the man who received a harsher sentence.
The prosecutor is seeking a lesser sentence for murder of a young person, to 12 years in prison.
They were in full understanding at the time.
According to the district court, a 17-year-old young man who worked as a director of the school’s child protection unit was killed in July last year.
The 17-year-old convicted of murder attacked the director sitting on the couch in the living room from behind.
The director had let go of his grip and led the young man to his room, where one of the young men hit him with a vacuum cleaner.
Among other things, the director was strangled, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to the mental health survey, both of the convicts were in full understanding at the time.
According to the court, the young people had planned to flee the family home at least from the previous day.
The ice shark is the world's longest-living vertebrate, breeding only at the age of 156
The world’s longest living vertebrate is the ice shark, according to a study published in the journal Science.
An ice shark, or holker, that swims around Greenland in the northern Atlantic Ocean can live up to 400 years.
The female does not reproduce until she is 156.
The life span of an ice shark is increased by the fact that it only grows by one centimeter per year.
Only one species of shellfish is known to outlive ice sharks.
The researchers found out the age by radiocarbon dating.
Due to nuclear testing in the 1950’s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
The researchers were able to estimate the age of the sharks.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years old - although the throw in one direction or the other can be as long as 120 years.
Donald Trump's economic wisdom - People's News
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need anything else.
As much as a third of the country’s total tax revenue would be lost if the corporate tax change advocated by Donald Trump is implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular through tax reliefs benefiting the wealthiest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he unveiled it in Detroit on Monday.
The corporate tax rate would fall from 35% to 15%.
We would be missing out on a huge sum of $1,000 billion a year.
The top income tax rate is now 39.6 per cent, after Trump’s proposed reduction of 33 per cent.
Inheritance tax would be abolished.
Trump accused the U.S. of over-regulating the economy and bankrupting small businesses.
The environmental standards decided on in haste must be re-established and the energy sector deregulated.
Barack Obama’s health care reform needs to be addressed again.
We need to appoint “experts” instead of “bureaucrats”.
“Destructive” trade policy is one of the main causes of U.S. problems, Trump said.
Free trade agreements should be abolished.
Imports from China would be subject to a 45% penalty, while imports from Mexico would be subject to a 35% penalty.
We offer a new future.
“Americanism, not globalism, is our creed,” Trump said.
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need anything else in the world:
American cars will drive through the streets, American planes will connect cities, American ships will control the seas, American steel will lift new skyscrapers all over the country.
Contrary to his habits, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by his aides, even though it was interrupted 14 times by well-organized protests.
Economists—including those close to Republicans—see Trump’s program taking the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own program on Friday.
A tsunami from the past - Kansan Uutiset
The sea is turbulent, but a tidal wave strikes amid the hustle and bustle of Madrid - the reckoning with the past can begin.
That is the essence of Pedro Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var’s new story.
Almodovari’s previous directorial work, Travel Lovers (2013), was a satirical comedy with a funny and raunchy side, preceding the film The Skin I Live In (2011), which was one of the highlights of my Spanish career.
Julieta (2016) is somewhere between those two works.
It is a conventionally serene love, relationship and family drama that focuses on the relationship between mother and daughter.
The story is simple and is largely seen as a long flashback.
Life seems to be going well for the middle-aged title character (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a random encounter, her new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) is left in awe all the way to the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta repeats the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
He begins with the time before his daughter is born, the moments when he met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher from the series Between Stitches (2013-2014), will rise to the second leading role.
Julieta’s aging has been handled in a way that can be considered a mess, but I would say quite neatly and literally with a single swipe.
Julieta has a fair distance to the flamboyance that is often so characteristic of Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var films, even in humour.
It is an equally strong, subdued film with good music and quite melancholy in some places, with elements of elegia as such.
On the other hand, the visual saturation typical of the Spanish director is still there, and in a way that slowly begins to catch the eye as a pure formality rather than a functional dramatic effect.
The characters of the film suffer illness, death or other sudden losses, but the surface remains just as Korean.
This is especially true of costumes: in the case of the title character, the outfits change from one scene to another, and the same is true of spectacular earrings.
Mr Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var is precise in these matters, but the main point, the settings of the current scene, does not get much better from this.
When repeated mechanically, the impression is external and a little inanimate.
Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var has written a screenplay based on three short stories by Canadian novelist Alice Munro, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2013.
The short stories have been published in The Fugitive: Stories.
Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var has invested in dialogue, resulting in a little bit of literary filmisation.
There would have been a lot of material for even the most emotionally robust drama, so many big things - especially the gnawing guilt - that the theme of the film deals with.
Written and directed by Pedro Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var.
Based on three short stories by Alice Munro.
Starring Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao and Dario Grandinetti.
The film premieres on August 12.
Government tries election rigging - People's News
There will be no further cuts, ministers keep repeating, so that the Finns Party does not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring are being carried out profusely.
There will be no further cuts.
The four billion savings already decided are enough.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (National Coalition Party) say during the budget session.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the Ministry’s proposal, because cuts in social security were decided already in the spring’s spending limits discussion.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index will be cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment security will be reduced from 500 days to 400.
The educational cuts continue.
Muntavaalit
Why are the ministers so keen to emphasise precisely that no further cuts will be made on top of these?
Because next year is an election year.
The municipal elections will be held in April and they are the most important thermometer of the parliamentary term, not the polls.
It has been seen before that the result of the municipal elections of the government parties in different directions will ruin the atmosphere of the government for a long time.
However, the polls indicate that the government party expects the Finns Party to lose out, even though the result of its previous elections was a modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns Party received 752 new councillors, most of whom will receive the right-wing government’s fee next spring.
The lifeblood of the government of three parties of approximately equal size depends on the persistence of the Finns Party.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted for the party had had enough of government policy already in the first year.
The first signs of the party’s parliamentary group’s fermentation have also surfaced.
The 'no new cuts' rhetoric, firstly, obscures the fact that next year they will be carried out drastically and, secondly, attempts are being made to soften the blow awaiting the Finns Party.
Major cuts in 2018?
A year from now, everything will probably be different – if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The Government has set itself the target of reducing indebtedness during this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo’s budget proposal will take out EUR 5.9 billion in debt next year, which is more than this year.
After the elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands at the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to follow its own programme: the debt will not be reduced or even slowed down.
The other is to stick to the program.
This means even tougher cuts in the 2017 budget.
The budget would be pushed at least close to balance during 2018, and then in the spring parliamentary elections will decide what comes next.
With these measures, indebtedness does not bend
It is quite clear that with the current measures, indebtedness will not be broken, even if Juha Sipilä tries to create a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäki at the budget awareness event prove this irrefutably:
Forecasts of global economic growth have repeatedly proved to be overoptimistic, i.e. there will be no pull from the international economy.
Finland’s national economy has not risen much since the collapse of 2008 except temporarily during the stimulus policy of the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in the last decade, with an average increase from 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion a year more than in 2008.
With the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60 per cent limit in 2014, will rise to 70 per cent in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt rescheduling proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost about six billion euros, which will be practically covered by taking on entirely new debt.
This is the view of the Centre Party, the National Coalition Party and the Finns Party of what is responsible.
Questionnaire: Municipalities should be given a lot of tasks
Three out of four believe that organising child day care, youth work and physical activity is the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by the KAKS - Foundation for Development of Local Government.
A clear majority of the population also assigns responsibility for libraries, culture, civic schools, building supervision, upper secondary school education and waste management to an individual municipality.
The county is most clearly responsible for regional planning, specialised medical care, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for the mentally disabled.
There is no wish to delegate any of the tasks of the municipalities to the state.
Underage drunk driver ends up running away from police
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu ran away from a police patrol on Ilomantsitie in Joensuu on Friday night at 1:30 a.m.
A police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle without lights, but the young man ran away from the police at a fair speed.
The chase continued to Sonkajanrantie, from where on to Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle ran off the road.
Still after this the young man ran away, but the faster-footed policeman caught the fugitive.
The breath test for the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a driver’s license to drive a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated as, for example, an aggravated endangerment of traffic safety.
A truck in a pile of rock fell into a ditch.
A truck loaded with stones fell into a ditch at Kaavintie in Polvijärvi on Thursday evening at 9.15 p.m.
The truck had driven off the road in a bend to the left and had fallen on its side into a ditch.
The rescue service lifted the injured driver out of the crashed truck through the door above, together with the rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
Lifting the vehicle was left to the car owner.
Hydraulic oil was spilled on the road from the crashed truck and the rescue department sucked it into the peat.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon.
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since this afternoon in the village of Lahdenkylä in Ilmajoki, South Ostrobothnia.
Police are looking for a woman who is about 165 cm tall, thin and well-groomed and has white hair under her chin.
You can call the Ostrobothnian Situation Centre on 0295440513 for observations and hints about the missing person’s movements.
Elements of a major accident in the air - see photo gallery Parafest's devastation
The surge that knocked down the Parafest festival tents caused extensive damage.
Arto Pippuri, President of the Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will get on its feet financially, and the event can also be held next year.
The last performer of the Parafest was Kalle Salonen.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with performances at the City Theatre starting at 1 p.m.
There is a Parafest exhibition at Ahjo Art Centre between 1pm and 3pm.
The programme will be organised as planned.
The surge current is generated in a thunder cloud when the rainwater and its weight initiate a descending air flow.
Changes in the water state of a thunder cloud bind heat, and thus the falling air mass cools and its speed towards the ground accelerates.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, several surges occur in Finland during the summer.
The route of the surges is difficult to predict.
The surge hit the back yard of the Joensuu Art Museum, which was the venue for Parafest, on Friday afternoon before 5 p.m.
Three of the tents fell down, and the total number of people in the tents was about 200.
Four people were slightly injured in the accident.
Among them was one child who was transported with minor injuries for further treatment.
Air pollution is ageing Londoners
According to research, the skin of Londoners ages faster than usual.
The cause of skin ageing is air pollution.
The British study is called the Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyses the most toxic particles in London’s air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that many retired Londoners have skin two and a half years older than, say, their rural counterparts.
Skin-aging fine particles are a very fine form of dust pollution that originates from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, kill nearly 9,500 Londoners every year.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early ageing is a risk, especially for Londoners who walk to work in crowded streets.
Residents of London can try to protect themselves from air pollution with masks, for example, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
The tractor's brakes failed. Pushed a man in front of it.
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
When he got out of the tractor and went to run in front of it, the tractor’s brakes failed and the tractor ran over the man.
The man did not fall under it, but the tractor was able to push the man enough that he was taken to the central hospital for further examination, seriously injured.
The tractor did not have time to run any further, as it hit the rocks in front of it.
A new strength for the coming season
Joensuu-based Liiga-Riento, who plays in the Volleyball Championship League, will start the series starting in October from a better starting point than in memory.
The team has been together for almost three weeks now.
I’m sure we can find common ground better than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
Jani Säisä, who will continue as the head coach of Riento, praises the new team as enterprising and united.
Fred Musoni starts his second season in Riento.
The new faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who played for the Rwanda national team, is a quarter-inch chipper.
Garchet, by contrast, is a passari, the Brazilian has a size of 198 centimeters.
Through Josban, Kataja and Jokipoikat to U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost every World Floorball Championships since 2003.
The sixth edition of the World Championships is now underway in Tampere, only 2013 was missed after Canada was better in North American qualifiers.
I was working in Turku and playing in the local women’s club when I noticed the advertisement.
The United States formed the national floorball team.
I was interested and here I am, 48, says Jumppanen.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near Elizabeth, New York.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, there was no such sport as floorball.
The game was played in college.
I played basketball in Kataja and later ice hockey in Jokipojt in Finnish championship, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played in the Finnish Floorball Championship with the university in 1991-92, the next three seasons were spent in Josba.
In addition to playing, he coached the A-girls to the championship.
Women's Finnish Championship career culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played 10 seasons in the Finnish Women’s Championship, the balance was 51+34<0x3D>85 in 169 games.
The most recent season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen were named to the national team
Josban was raised by Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen was selected to join the Finnish national team, which plays in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
The 25-year-old Perttu Puska has played six men’s international games in Helsinki, where he has scored a total of 9+4<0x3D>13 points.
Tatu Väänänen, the 32-year-old defender of the Swiss side Wiler-Ersigen, has recovered from a leg injury and is part of the national team’s standard equipment with 117 international matches.
The national team also included Mika Kohonen, a veteran of the Seinäjoki Gaming Club, who was last seen in the Finland shirt at last December’s World Cup.
The head coach of the floorball team is Petri Kettunen from Kontiolahte.
Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - Finnish Championship gold is missing from the trophy cabinet
Essi Hasu is finishing as a beach volley player at least temporarily after the current season.
The Finnish championships of Beach volley will be decided this weekend at Kouvola Sports Park.
Over the course of three days, the medals will be played in both adult and junior series.
In co-operation with the Kouvola Volleyball Federation and the Finnish Volleyball Association, the six best pairs in each league ranking are eligible for the final tournament.
The local colour in the tournament is represented by Elimäki’s YMCA bred Essi Hasu, who has been one of the top beach volleys in Finland for several years.
Nowadays living in Helsinki, Hasu is looking forward to the games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get to see it this weekend.
I'm sure there's a great arena coming to the Pesis Stadium.
I haven’t played in the adult leagues in Kouvola very often, so it’s great to play in the finals at home,” Hasu says.
The Kouvola region lit up Hasu’s spark for sports and provided a good starting point for a great hobby.
I have fond memories of childhood.
I started playing volleyball at the age of 9 in Elimäki’s YMCA E-girls.
The top of my mind is a shirt that is too big, knee pads that roll around in my ankles, as well as awesome ace screams and choreographies after the point,” Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close-knit community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit created an environment where it was fun to play.
All the families were strongly involved - the father of the teammate coached us and our mother was the club’s president for a long time.
For Essi Hasu, beach volley was already a natural choice of sport to counterbalance indoor volleyball.
The beach at the curve pond has been used as a beach game since the 1990s.
The action has always been active.
I also went to watch the Finnish Junior Championships, thinking that one day I would be there to play.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays together with Pieksämäkeläinen Anniina Parkkinen in the Finnish Championship finals.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-placed pair is clear.
A realistic goal is a medal.
We're still short of SM-gold in the trophy cabinet, Hasu throws mysteriously.
This weekend’s performance in Kouvola may be Hasu’s last performance in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges in the field of civilian work await.
The international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, the flip-flops will be put on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
Flooding toppled tents at disabled people’s event in Joensuu, a major accident was near

Salomon Koli bravely became an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as an entrepreneur means risk-taking, sweating and vigor.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future also in rural areas.
Almost two years ago, Koli and his little brother Valtteri Koli started operating as a successor to their home farm.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers through his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant taking on debt and increasing the size of the farm so that the bread could come from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I have always enjoyed working on the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur myself, I have put everything into the game.
If you want to start something, you have to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started to build a barn without a yard, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
However, I joined the project with great courage and have been fully involved in it, Salomon Koli says and adds that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in producing clean Finnish food and that everything will turn out well.
Salomon Koli, which grows cattle, aims to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has yielded results, as Salomon Koli has been selected among the top ten in the competition of the young food producer of Maaseudun Tulevaisuus magazine.
He is now competing for a possible win.
You can vote for him on the magazine’s website until 21 August.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest reading in years (after June 2012) and the first reading above zero since October last year, when a positive 0.2% was reported.
The annual average inflation, measured by the cost of living index, was -0.8% in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016), when compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The cost-of-living index for July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015), the inflation rate has been -0.2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, the prices of the following consumer goods rose in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household goods and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained on level with the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat's "anime" effect is rated an Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, the anime has served as a source of inspiration for the filter, but according to some observers, it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat enables its approximately 150 million daily users to shape reality and play with identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character that would fit Roy Lichtenstein’s painting.
Lenses are simple, facial-twisting tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies a day.
All missteps quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat’s lenses have previously been criticized for promoting a blackface mask or whitened skin color as a beauty ideal.
So when Snapchat advertised this week to some users a lens that gave them slanted eyes, slanted teeth, and plump cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people — a “yellowface.”
And they wonder if these repeated polemics could be a sign of the company’s bigger problem with diversity.
News and disapproval spread widely on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, the day after Snapchat said it had discontinued the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant as a tribute to anime characters, not a caricature of Asians.
But for racist observers, the lens was a reminder of the offensive stereotypes in action.
Others vehemently denied the anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said in an email that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable."
He added that “it’s hard to argue against a comparison between an outrageous Asian caricature and filter effects side by side.”
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face taken to the extreme of contempt.
Snapchat isn’t the only company to cross these cultural trappings.
American culture seems to be caught up in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and equipment that we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat’s huge audience of youngsters who are more racially diverse than their parents may mean they’re even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
Katie Zhu, 25, said in an interview on Thursday that when one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an offensive image, “it’s much harder for these guys to be unnoticed.”
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In a letter to Medium and in a telephone interview, he said he believed race disputes reflected a lack of diversity in Snapchat’s hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the company’s predominantly white male leadership and ended his writing with the hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#RemoveSnapchat)
"Either they don't have a diverse representation of different skin colors on their staff, which is why they're able to make decisions like this," Zhu said, "or they have representatives of different skin colors at work, but they're not in positions where they feel safe or can speak up."
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint to which Snapchat has largely failed to respond.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its employees, pointing out its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but the representative said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and push forward internal inclusion efforts.
Zhu, for his part, said he would keep his Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not okay."
Congressional Panel Says Military Officials Distorted ISIS Intelligence
In a report released Thursday, a congressional panel said officials at U.S. military headquarters in the war zone had edited intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than the events on the ground justified.
An interim report by the Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee found “widespread dissatisfaction” among intelligence analysts at headquarters who said their assessments of American efforts to defeat ISIS were being tampered with by superiors.
The headquarters, known as Centcom, is the headquarters of the Armed Forces Military Headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence outputs approved by senior Centcom executives typically gave a more positive picture of U.S. counterterrorism efforts than was justified by the facts on the ground. They were consistently more positive than analyses produced by other intelligence community contributors," the report said in a press release.
“Centcom’s events are unacceptable — our fighters in the war are suffering when bad analyses are presented to high-ranking policymakers,” said Rep. Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
The failures of Centcom’s management reach to the very top of the organization.
The 10-page report details ongoing problems with headquarters descriptions and analyses of U.S. efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
While it does not provide clear evidence that senior administration officials in the Obama administration ordered the reports to be tampered with, it does portray analysts as feeling that Centcom’s leaders were putting pressure on them to portray the threat posed by the Islamic State, ISIS, in a more positive light.
“Throughout the first half of 2015, many of the headquarters’ press releases, statements, and testimonies to Congress were far more positive than the events themselves,” the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major offensive to recapture Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, is still under ISIS control.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear," Rep. Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the top intelligence officers at the U.S. military headquarters manipulated intelligence outputs from the headquarters to downplay the threat of ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans created the task force after hearing that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic state was being manipulated.
The report, which was published on Thursday, will be followed by more extensive findings while the investigation is ongoing.
The Department of Defense's inspector general has opened an additional, ongoing investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday released their findings, which were consistent with some of the final conclusions of the Republican task force.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a process that was unnecessarily isolated from the intelligence assessment of ISIS and Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Schiff, the committee’s lead Democrat, in a statement.
According to Schiff, this process "extended the release of intelligence outputs," worsened the mood among analysts, and "did not give enough room for divergent perspectives."
Schiff and the Democrats said they could find no evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions into a “pre-set or political narrative.”
The Daily Beast reported Tuesday on the preliminary findings of the congressional inquiry.
Last August, The New York Times reported that a Pentagon inspector general has opened an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report as long as the inspector general's investigation was ongoing.
But he said that “experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential national security issues.”
The investigation has implications beyond just the question of whether US-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria are successful (as a growing number of defense officials now claim).
Last year’s accusations questioned how much President Obama can rely on the headquarters to provide honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of Islamic State intelligence reflects more than a decade of controversy when Centcom’s intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote an investigative article saying that despite protests from several analysts, the administration of President George W. Bush supported a small force in Iraq and spent very little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, Hooker’s team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes against Islamic State-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group’s economy, as it had built temporary refineries to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery was not reported outside the headquarters.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after his testimony to the Senate was viewed by many lawmakers as an over-positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
U.S. Wins Women's Field Hockey for Fourth Consecutive Match with Britain
The day after scoring three goals for the team to beat Japan 6-1, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team on Thursday after the Americans beat India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but the 27-year-old Bam said he wasn’t sure if he had done the same before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps track of his paintings."
But he knows this: the Americans are in a 4-0 position in the Olympic tournament and they share first place with Britain, which was still unbeaten after defeating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will face off in the final game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams have made it to the quarterfinals, and this game will determine who will finish first and who will finish second in their group of six teams.
First-placed avoids a strong Dutch, the leader of the second group, for a little longer at the start of the quarter-finals.
No matter how Saturday’s game ends, the Americans have raised a stir with their surprising success here, four years after they missed the last of the 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and picked up a field hockey bat for the first time at the age of 3 (his older twin sisters played the sport at Drexel) when he joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming the youngest player ever.
He did not participate in the 2008 Olympics because he was not included in the final roster.
In 2012, nothing happened to him and his teammates.
The following year, Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
“Cultural change, spiritual change, physical change,” Bam said.
We didn’t have the same pace of work in London as we do now.
We've made a U-turn.
On Thursday night, Bam started the first half goal with a slingshot close to the goal.
India had come into play with no wins in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took over.
He carried the ball for a long time on the left side of the field, then circled to the center and dragged the ball to the finish line, leading the Americans 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
This zero was the first goaltender in the tournament for Jackie Briggs, who had scored one goal in each of the first three wins.
He's in a good mood.
So is Bam.
"We have a good situation now," Parnham said, "but how good it is will depend on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Trampoline peace in the midst of Olympic fervor
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, the Olympics are on.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be a constant and inevitable, a furious message of competition and effort.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a flaming baton relayed from archer to swimmer and from gymnast to triathlete.
It’s impossible to turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to a neighbor’s conversation in a queue at a coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first-time Olympic gold medalist and future heartbreaker with a smiley face, could very well be one of those names that everyone knows and is presented at prime-time and supported by sponsorship deals and good-humour TV commercials - if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a fencer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, competes for Olympic gold on a trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all species equally.
Farther from the center, partly in the shade, are those species that not everyone generally accepts: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We always have a breaststroke, long live it.
But if I may make a moderate number of my special favorites, I would like to draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since its first appearance at the Sydney Games in 2000, its presence in the intervening 16 years has been so little noticed that many of the people I interviewed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete did not progress to the final until 2012.
The Chinese and the Russians usually share the men’s, Chinese and Canadian women’s medals.
This year, Dong Dong of China and Rosie McLennan of Canada will defend their gold medals in London.
However, the trampoline has a certain underdog charm, partly because to the uneducated ear it sounds more suitable for clown school than for the Olympics.
I have to admit that I’m not an expert, I’m just a flightless fan.
There are opportunities for amusement in the species, as is noted by the vibration of the endless bounces of cartoons, but there is also the grace of gymnastics and swimming, two species that basically come together in it.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word el trampol<0xC3><0xAD>n, which means springboard.
Jumping up to nearly 30 feet on a giant trampoline, the champions must complete a series of twisting movements (turns, folds and folds) and finally land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated on the basis of execution, difficulty and "flight time".
Rio has 32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction for the Olympics is straight ahead.
Those who want a medal must go further, faster, up and over - sometimes to the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
They hunt not only for the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in televised news coverage, for another derisive line: the world or Olympic record.
This purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable and even fanatical – and can even bring the viewer to tears.
But that’s also the reason why watching the games can be a bit exhausting.
Trampoline offers a moment of rest from this.
The direction of the trampoline is up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The competitor ascends to a new ascent, appearing weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Of course, there is no lack of competition or difficulty, but during the program there is no frenzied rush towards the end, no jumps into the distance, only a dreamlike, smooth interruption of time and gravity.
It’s as close to zen space as the Olympics can get.
The women’s qualification competition and then the final will take place on Friday afternoon when the broadcast starts at 1 pm (ET), the men’s competition will also be held on Saturday at 1 pm.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of their afternoon show starting at 2:00 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic rush, they offer a quiet, charming moment that most likely will not be noticed in the general chaos.
And if awareness is only achieved by offering male athletes to stare at and objectify (as U.S. male gymnasts recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his sighing new fan base.
‘Generation to protest’ in Ethiopia, long-time US ally
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators calling for political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia breaking up?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa’s most stable countries, a strong ally of the West, with a rapidly growing economy.
In recent months, however, anti-government protests have shaken the country as it spread to more and more areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people stormed the streets demanding radical political change.
According to human rights groups, the government’s response was merciless.
Witnesses said police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
The video footage, which is believed to be from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, shows security officers beating young people with sticks while they were forced to stand with their hands against the wall.
The United Nations' main human rights authority is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“Holding this country together was always difficult, and it will be even more so in the future,” said Rashid Abdi, project manager for the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and the West values its stability.
America’s military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives that much Western aid.
Ethiopia’s economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved enormously, and there is even a new commuter train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy, human rights organisations have constantly spoken about the repression of the regime, the opposition in the country has been limited and dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But this could be changing.
"If you repress people and they have no choice but to protest, this is what will happen," Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer from central Ethiopia, said.
All the young people are protesting.
One generation is protesting.
The complaints are manifold and cover everything from land use to the stranglehold of the ruling coalition power.
After last year's much-criticised elections, the ruling party and its allies took the last seat in the opposition and now holds all the seats in Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are mounting on the Eritrean border, a battle that took hundreds of lives in June along this strained and controversial border.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, may try to exploit the turmoil and re-arm themselves.
Numerous factors explain why, after years of stirring beneath the surface, bitter feelings are now exploding.
The first seems seemingly harmless: smartphones.
It is only in the last few years that a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more common and the internet service has improved.
Even if the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate through location-hiding network proxies.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they gathered for demonstrations.
Secondly, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia, the Oromo and the Amhara, get along better together.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the Amharic, who come from the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia, were successful in politics and business, using Oromos, many of whom are Muslim and live in the lowlands.
But this too is changing.
"We are on our way to organizing under one umbrella," Oromo leader Mulatu Gemechu said.
The largest demonstrations have taken place in the Amharic and Oromo areas.
Many Amharic and Oromo people think that Ethiopia is unfairly ruled by the Tigre people, who cover about 6% of the population and control the armed forces, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly competent to spot early signs of discontent and use secret envoys to make opponents harmless.
“The current regime has no such basic instinct,” said conflict analyst Abdi.
Ethiopia’s new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked relatively unknown to fill Meles’s boots.
Unlike Meles, who was originally from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say that the security services controlled by tigers do not trust him.
Many fear that this may lead to increased bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia was in such turmoil was in 2005, when thousands of people protested about elections, which, according to analysts, appeared to have been swindled and then robbed by the government.
In the ensuing crackdown, many demonstrators died, albeit fewer than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for the significant progress they have made in the fight against poverty.
But clearly this has not stopped the internal intensification of contempt on the part of the Ethiopian government.
And now it is beginning to take on a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in the Amharic city of Gondar attacked companies owned by tigers, and anti-tigre hatred is becoming more common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the United States and other Western allies in a clumsy position.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights to neighboring Somalia, even though it recently said it had closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its already unstable region’s allies to collapse.
“This,” Abdi said, “is a real balancing act.”
Donald Trump Explains Obama-Based-Isis Claim as 'Sarcastic'
Donald J. Trump tried to stifle the controversy over his latest campaign on Friday by claiming he wasn’t serious when he repeatedly this week warned that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The investigation raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s ability to communicate clearly with the American public.
It also put his defenders, who have struggled to defend him during a turbulent period, in an awkward position where they have to explain remarks that he doesn’t necessarily mean.
After the insinuation at the campaign meeting on Wednesday night, Trump argued the same increasingly keenly in Thursday’s interviews, in which he insisted that his intent was indeed to say that the President and Clinton created ISIS.
But in an early Friday morning tweet, Trump said he was just being sarcastic.
The release was a turnaround from the previous day, when Trump said in several interviews that he was indeed serious about the accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump tone down his remarks by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate took to heart.
The latest criticism comes as Trump has sought to refocus his campaign in the midst of opinion polls that are falling on the economy.
Trump and Clinton fought over the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump returned to the subject.
Escaping again on Twitter, he warned that Clinton’s proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that he found the speech boring.
Trump has used sarcasm before.
Late in July, after facing widespread criticism for apparently suggesting that the Russians should hack Clinton’s emails, he later explained his remarks by saying “of course I’m being sarcastic.”
The approach will allow Trump to walk the boundaries of political speech and then come back if necessary.
“I think it’s a model where he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He looks at how they work and then ‘clarifies’ one way or the other depending on the reaction,” said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he’s crafty about his statements and knows they’re vague enough to be filtered through a number of different lenses.
Rather than softening his speech to a large voting audience, Trump has been more gallant in recent days as his popularity has continued to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Friday showed that Trump is trailing Clinton significantly in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tough in Florida.
While Trump tends to avoid apologizing for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misreading his words or misinterpreting his sense of humor.
As he faces ever closer scrutiny during the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have forced his loyal allies into an uncomfortable position where they must publicly support him, no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump’s most prominent supporters, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in a CNN interview on Thursday.
“I believe there are real, political comments in his words,” Giuliani said when asked about the veracity of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded an Islamic state.
That’s true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization that he called amateur, completely wrong, and that’s why it happened, because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, where Clinton worked as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to get worse because it failed to effectively address the situation in the Middle East.
Before the Pennsylvania Friday meetings, Trump continued the attack on Twitter towards the news media, which are raving about his every word and are biased against him.
He ridiculed the “bad, pathetic” television experts who were trying to find out about him, saying, “They won’t succeed!”
Some Democrats ridiculed Trump’s excuse as new evidence that he was unfit to be president.
Previously closed cafe returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-only place in Williamsburg that didn’t have a wireless network, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the side of Bedford Avenue was too expensive for that.
The movement that replaced the Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells soaps in the shape of a cupcake.
The locals lamented it as the latest loss in a town being renovated to middle-class status.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is devastated and Verb is a soap store now."
But if New York is about change, it's also about reinventing.
The revived Verb opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and you can pay with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and it has the same unsophisticated atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new Verb will be led by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old café who is the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When the client offered to fund him in a new location, he said he was thrilled.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought a similar espresso machine.
It even used the lights of the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try it, too.
He brought in new ingredients.
The menu includes bacon-egg-cheese sandwiches, and coatings include capers and browned onions.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
Beer is no longer served in the café, but fresh juices are made there.
In nine months, Rodriguez says he noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"Williamsburg was too expensive for many former customers," he said.
One Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one such customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he wandered into a coffee shop.
He says that after Verb closed, he gave up drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that I enjoyed the Verb's coffee and culture," he said.
Now she’s back with coffee, although that day she ordered a mixed chai instead of her usual iced coffee, which is one of the new additions.
Another long-time customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been a loyal visitor to Verb since 2003.
He used to go there before work, and he always made the same order.
“Every day at 3:00 p.m., regularly like clockwork, I went in and they were making my spicy bagel with butter,” she said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes his usual order, but sometimes, for variety, he orders a spicy bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn't hold a grudge against the soap store that took over the old premises.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cheries offered to make a special soap for the Verb that would use the coffee’s cold-extracted coffee as an ingredient.
"I think we can still take the offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also accepted the cafe.
One of these new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he plans to put it up somewhere soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
A local juicer wants to bottle and sell cold-extracted coffee.
It is possible that the cafe will expand into the adjacent building.
For many customers, it is enough to get their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular and said he was disconsolate when the place closed.
When the new place opened, Whitt said he felt like he had come home as he walked in and ordered coffee.
“I wanted to smell it,” he said.
A Square Meal: The Paralyzing Food of the Depression
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in his office.
President Roosevelt loved the sophisticated Fifth Avenue dishes, such as foie gras pasta, and the Maryland Marsh Turtle Soup.
On that day, his diet was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, plum pudding.
"It was a demonstration of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering," Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.”
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, told the story of Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told the story of life in a Lower East Side apartment building through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, which Harper will release on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Showing some culinary solidarity of their own, they meet the journalist for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, unsophisticated lunch bar in the Flatiron district that has been in operation since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a serving of turkey, mashed potatoes, and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered a meatloaf, the couple found it appropriate to discuss eating during the depression.
"The concerns were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut fritters, liver fritters, bean fritters.
They were made from an ingredient and some cheap ingredient that was used to continue the actual ingredient.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to make up your dinner.
Coe grinned.
"It must have felt like lead in the stomach," he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American tables, especially in the countryside, were like eating-so-much-as-can-eat buffets.
Groups of women cooked for male farm workers, and fresh pies were served at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
The Americans sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal chronicled the ways in which a nation survived from a sudden end to a land of abundance.
“At the time, food became a central, distressing topic for Americans,” Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new, affordable diet: mystery dishes like dumplings and boxes became the main dishes, and the box was "an awesome way to use leftovers," Ziegelman said, because the chefs were able to hide the less-attractive ingredients under a layer of creamy sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which had been at the heart of American meals for years, became a sparingly dosed luxury product.
The special compositions were tried when the amount of calories and the nutrient content were more important than the taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
While doing research for a book also containing recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish of the era in which fried onions were stuffed with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the dinner table," Coe said.
Ziegelman elaborated, "It was unreal."
Peanut butter is not suitable for fried onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Home economics experts such as Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Household Administration from 1923 to 1943, guided the country’s eating habits more than ever before or since.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become “budgeters” and meet the challenge of converting lumps like puréed spaghetti and carrots into tasty portions.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical treats.
Particularly tasty are the reports of the government's reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's 'let me eat cake' attitude.
While publicly praising the simple, Iowan country food of his childhood, he dined like the sophisticated millionaire he had become.
"He liked continental food, like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
She was eating in a nearly gold-plated dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was so out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to be an example on his own stomach.
As reported in the book, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place that “offered not only one of Washington’s bleakest meals, but also the most poorly prepared.”
Many of the lama’s eating habits were abandoned as soon as the land got back on its feet.
The legacy is our continued focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that while writing the book, they gained a better understanding of Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits, such as not being able to throw away food.
"He was really afraid of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "He even made people sick."
There's been a cape incident.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called plum foam," Ziegelman said, adding that the common trick was to give modest recipes a showy name.
There was no whipped cream in the dessert, only plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
They all dipped their spoons unwillingly into the sticky, brown paste.
Surprisingly, it wasn’t bad.
Coe did it once, and then he did it again.
Sounding like a positive budgeter, he told his wife, “a little chopped walnuts could help.”
Gilead Will Be Indemnified for Lawyer Costs in the Hepatitis C Patent Battle Against Merck
A U.S. district judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to legal costs incurred in a case involving a hepatitis C patient against drug maker Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was acquitted of $200 million in fees for their violation of two of Merck’s patents related to Gilead’s successful drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni. This release followed a U.S. judge finding Merck guilty of misconduct involving perjury and other unethical practices.
In a verdict Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to be released from compensation for its opposition to the lawsuit.
Merck is trying to catch Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The lawsuit dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other over the ownership of sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead’s pharmaceuticals.
U.S.-backed forces say they have completely taken over ISIS-controlled Manbij
U.S.-backed forces have taken full control of the northern city of Manbij, close to the Turkish border, since the last remaining ISIS fighters left the city, a spokesman for the group said Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last group of fighters hiding in the city left.
The troops had freed more than 2,000 winged hostages held by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF's ally, the Manbij military council, told Reuters.
"We now have full control of the city, but we have begun to investigate it," he told Reuters.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2% of federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband’s income that year was $10.75 million, and that their actual federal tax rate was 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, primarily the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speaker compensation, and the former Secretary of State announced that he had received $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for his book about his career at the State Department.
Clinton’s vice presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, published 10-year tax returns.
Their actual federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and cancels previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even though they are not required to do so by law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have pleaded with the IRS’s audit as a reason for refusing to disclose tax returns.
"Your turn," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter, posting a link to the Democratic candidate's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump’s special adviser, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audits were complete.
Critics of Trump, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said his refusal raises questions about his capital, his donations to charities, his business, and numerous other ties to countries such as Russia.
Clinton has tackled the problem by releasing an online video on Friday showing prominent Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the issue in his economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate in the last few decades has done: publish his tax returns," he told the audience.
Politico has announced that Trump has paid no or very little taxes in two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist quoted on Friday numerous tax lawyers and accountants who said the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential election.
Clinton has backed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure those who make more than $1 million a year would pay at least 30 percent in taxes.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a Clinton meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he, too, is in the midst of an audit by the tax board, and that Trump is not “fearing” the tax office, but voters.
The Clinton campaign has been publishing tax returns since 2007.
Today, the actual federal tax rate for the Clintons living in Chappaqua, New York, was about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined tax rate was about 40.5%.
Clinton’s 2015 tax return showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment was a low-cost, index-linked mutual fund, and Clinton reported $109,000 in dividend and interest income.

Chili powder condoms and firecrackers improve elephant protection in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania are using an unusual method to prevent elephants from migrating to human settlements - they throw animals with condoms filled with chili powder.
The method has proven effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea several years ago, together with the US-based Nature Conservancy, has stepped up its advertising by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step approach to protecting homes and crops without harming the animals.
In the past, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since we developed...tools, we’ve seen a shift in attitudes in these communities. They are now much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them,” Honeyguide Executive Director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps include pointing at an invading elephant with a flashlight and playing the horn.
If it does not prevent the animal, the so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and earth and firecracker, after which the condom is screwed so that only the ignition wire remains visible.
When the condom is ignited, it bursts with a bang and spews chili powder dust into the air.
One snort is usually enough to send the elephant in the other direction.
As a last resort, a detonator fires a Roman candle into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: Jewish filmmaker criticizes Berlin hotel for removing Israeli area code at Arab request
A French Jewish filmmaker unleashed a media storm after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's country code, according to the employee, due to "requests" from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, who made the documentary Shoah about the Holocaust, vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter in the German FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the country code list provided by the hotel.
However, the country is not listed among the countries that can be called directly from a hotel room.
How can it be that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been removed and wiped out?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through its own call center.
While looking for an explanation, the filmmaker raised the issue at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer he received from there "shocked him".
The hotel’s receptionist said it was “a deliberate decision by the Kempinski hotel management.”
The reason behind the decision was even more shocking to the filmmaker.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they are demanding the removal of the Israeli area code," the worker said, according to Lanzmann.
Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, Israel’s ambassador to Germany, called the case a “great injustice,” the Zuddeutsche Zeitung reported.
"We were horrified and shocked by the incident.
That in itself is a great injustice.
But it is even more shameful that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain.
This doesn't need an explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions,” the official said.
The incident sparked quite a reaction online when people called it a scandal.
Some argued that the Kempinski hotel simply "surrendered" to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
“Shame on you,” said another publication, which noted that the hotel, located on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm street, stands near the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly denied all the charges and called what had happened "inaccuracy" and "apology" from Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
"A clear order not to include Israel on the shortlist was never made," a spokesman for Kempinski said, according to Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the area code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against students protesting in Brazil
Students clashed with police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo as students gathered to protest against reforms of the government’s public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The problems began when law enforcement tried to disperse a group of students, which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended the demonstration to express their horror at the plans.
S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo Governor Paulo Geraldo Alckmin proposed closing just under 100 public schools and relocating 300,000 students to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen writing graffiti on the walls against President Michel Temer.
This latest demonstration came just days after protesters marched in unity to support the impeached President, Dilma Rousseff, as the country's Senate voted to impeach her.
RT Business: Russian-Iranian trade surges 71%
Since the sanctions were lifted, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 percent year-on-year, according to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since the lifting of international sanctions on Iran, Russian companies have shown a great deal of interest in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are continuing their existing ties to Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
"Obviously one of the most important goals of Iran's two-way cooperation is the expansion of trade," Dzhagaryan said.
He pointed out that in the first five months of 2016, the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9 % compared to the same period in 2015, totalling USD 856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose by 91.5% to a total of $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $158 million.
"The increase in trade was achieved through the delivery of machines, vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to come to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign representation in Iran granted approximately 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mainly for travel.
It was also the first time that Iran was among the 20 countries with the highest number of tourists visiting Russia.
"It is safe to say that last year's record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd. They have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Scotland's Callum Skinner Hits the Finish Line as Brits Take Bike Gold
Callum Skinner of Scotland took the title in a men’s team sprint at the Rio cycling stadium last night when the British team defended their title from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was an anchor in the role in which his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy excelled, the legend was proud of the young man as he raced to the finish line, taking the victory from the favourite New Zealand team.
Britain took the shock victory four years ago, while Hoy won his fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after a modest sixth place finish at the March World Track Championships in London, although Hoy has since finished his racing career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of special broadcaster Jamie Staff.
This was accomplished just in time for Hindes to appear.
Hoy’s ending also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man whom British coaches held on to in the face of the Scottish potential that has now been realized.
Hindes, Kenny - who won the championship with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set the Olympic record in qualifying, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was far behind after his own lap, but Kenny pushed the team into the lead, and Skinner held on to it.
The strategy change was a big part of the transformation, and included Hindes driving in a bigger gear to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep up with the pace.
Hoy followed his position as an expert on the BBC and drew the attention of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they entered the podium.
23-year-old Skinner, from Glasgow, said: “Comparison is flattering.”
I'm only here to do my best and to make a name for myself.
We set the Olympic record in the finals and won the world champions.
It was absolutely unbelievable.
There can be no better way to win.
After defeating Kenny and Hoy in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he had intentionally crashed on the track after a bad start.
He later retracted his comments, and British rivals have not complained.
This time, there was no such problem with the overwhelming victory.
Hindes said, "It felt like being in London with so many British flags on the pedestal."
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We’ve lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply fantastic.
One event, one gold medal for the nation, which won seven out of ten cycling events in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the past five months, we are looking forward to a successful five days at the cycling stadium.
It is not at all impossible, given Kenny’s fitness, to imagine him repeating Hoy’s feat of winning three Olympic gold medals in a single Olympics.
That would mean that the total number of medals for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (that apparently sacred day in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - would rise to six golds and one silver.
That would be like Hoy's.
Kenny's next race is the Sprint, which starts today and lasts three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, “I’m just enjoying this one now.
Team competition is always the best.
You win it with your friends.
“Winning alone is, frankly, lonely.”
Hindes said, "If he wins the other two gold medals, he should be given the rank of knight."
This was the only medal race of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest in a four-man, four-kilometre team chase.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The 2012 London gold record is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will take place today, the second day of the race, when Wiggins will certainly be the centre of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before qualifying, when officials called him for a length measurement.
In a similar women’s race, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavien advanced to the world record time when the clock stopped at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its great track cycling team will take over the middle of the Olympic Games and achieve a whole bunch of medals.
After presenting truly exceptional and complete control in Beijing and London, expectations have been downplayed before the Rio Games.
The background has been drama, not the least of which was the April break-up of technical director Shane Sutton on charges of sexism and temptation, as well as the end of the racing careers of big names such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the first night’s races at the cycling stadium, it seems that Britain’s now legendary reputation for peaking at the perfect moment could once again be true.
Portland smelter’s future questionable due to cuts in electricity contract
The future of Portland’s Victoria aluminum smelter, as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers, is uncertain when the power company that distributes electricity to the plant revealed that one of the plant’s owners is about to terminate a distribution contract, so a cut in all distribution contracts is expected.
The measure follows a decision by the Victorian administration earlier this year that the subsidies required to keep the plant in operation will not be continued.
Aid for a specified period of 20 years will expire in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at the Alcoa Portland plant.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be at risk, directly or indirectly, as a result of the closure of the factory.
In addition, the snowball effect may be possible, as the smelter uses about 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa shut down the Point Henry smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoa Portland smelter is losing money and is under threat of closure.
The measure follows several years of speculation about the future of the plant, which began as a result of the strong Australian dollar and has recently been driven by the price of the plant’s production.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminum smelter from its Loy Yang An plant in Latrobe Valley, said it also expects three other owners to terminate their contracts.
The majority of the plant is owned by Alcoa and the Alumina Group, with smaller holdings by CITIC in China and Marubeni Corp in Japan.
“AGL is looking forward to the continued operation of the Portland plant, which means that the physical electricity demand for the smelter will continue,” it said.
According to the AGL, the agreements are so-called “hedging agreements” that were supposed to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will effectively end in 2017.
"That's why AGL expects the contracts to deliver results in fiscal year 2017," the power company said.
All potential earnings impacts for AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by the strong outlook for wholesale electricity futures markets.
The AGL said it has already “anticipated termination” by reducing the value of contracts in its accounts by $187 million.
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contracts “does not affect Alcoa’s ... ability to keep the smelter operational or secure the smelter’s electricity supply.”
The US company said it signed a 20-year deal with Loy Yang in 2010 and that the deal was due to come into effect in November this year, but it has yet to explain why it withdrew from the deal.
Analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the poor economic situation in the sector.
Earlier this week, AGL executive director Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity each year, and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
"If both plants leave the market, this will be a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity] market.
“As a producer of electricity, this would not be good for us,” he said.
Kendall, not just a Kardashian reality star, is on the cover of September’s Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, 20, the fourth daughter of model and mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner, is on the cover of the sought-after September issue of Vogue in the United States.
Kendall, Estee Lauder’s brand ambassador and model at the Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Weeks, announced the news Thursday on her Instagram account.
“Watching this cover in a room full of loved ones made me cry,” Kendall wrote.
The cover release was followed by a quirky (or perhaps just Kardashian-style?) scripted reality video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (except for the problematic cases of Rob and Caitlyn, and which included everyone’s favorite entertainment, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot the surprise of their sister’s cover, but ended in a classic twist:
It's the cliché of almost every children's TV show's "birthday episode" (Seacrest pronounces the lines "you didn't think we'd forget you" with the credibility of the morning cartoon bunny), but Kris had to somehow get her other girls to benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have certainly entered a new Kardashian era with the September Vogue slot.
Kendall’s older sister Kim may have gotten to Vogue’s cover first (she shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is in a class of its own.
The September issue of Vogue is the best-selling issue of the year.
Its thickness is more like a coffee table than a fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion calculated that 615 of last year’s 832-page opus had advertising content).
Its cover is expected to be revealed so fiercely that for the past two years, pictures of the magazine have leaked before the official release.
Previous women on the cover have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have indeed been more “celebrities acting as models” than “models who are celebrities”.
The Oscar winner and Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga’s honorary title.
But if Jenner, described by the magazine as the “success model” of her generation, should fall into the first category, she’s in pretty good company.
These celebrities aren’t relatives of famous people or reality stars or today’s youth who know how to make a good Snapchat video (though Jenner has all of that).
They are justifiably talented women who thrive in the entertainment industry.
With the release of Lemonade, Beyoncé has had one of the strongest years of her career.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner’s success.
With her reality-TV history, Jenner’s position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitches of the moment."
This feeling resurfaced with Jenner’s Vogue cover.
But running around in discontent is irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
She's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's foundation.
He and all his sisters sell you pictures of themselves in their own apps behind the paywall.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which she took for LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, possibly just to see his sister Kourtney and her children, he is a reality TV star.
Community legal centres turn 160,000 people away every year
Every year, more than 160 000 of the most vulnerable people are turned away from the Community's legal centres as the sector prepares for the impact of further cuts in funding on its already marginalised activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no chance of fighting unfair evictions and the like - are already being turned away in search of free legal advice and representation.
The Community's legal services, already stretched to the limit, are preparing for further cuts.
In June next year, these legal centers are due to lose 30 percent of their federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Community Legal Centres, said that the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres census report shows that thousands of people are already being turned away every year.
Farrell said that if the federal government’s decision is not reversed, the situation will only get worse.
“The legal centers of the Queensland community are chronically underfunded, which means that every year thousands of people are turned away from the essential services they need,” he said.
People leaving violent relationships with uncontrollable and crippling debts, separated families, unfairly fired employees — all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent in June 2017, meaning thousands of vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without assistance.
We appeal to the Attorney General and to Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately reverse these funding cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the state government delivered on its promise to raise funding for legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the Community Legal Centre and their client communities, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump’s campaign was sued after an employee was allegedly threatened with a gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was sued for allegedly doing nothing after they were told the campaign’s North Carolina operations chief threatened a gunman in February while they were driving a Jeep.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed by Vincent Bordin, a former state campaign software intern, on Wednesday in a Charlotte state court.
Bordini said he waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally before realizing “it wasn’t going to happen.”
Chief Earl Phillip "took out his pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger and pushed the barrel against Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign administration, Bordini heard that at least four other people had had a similar experience with Phillip.
“You don’t have to fire guns to cause damage,” Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The challenge comes just two days after a Republican presidential candidate caused outrage when he told the public in North Carolina that “second-rate people” — usually understood as gun owners and gun enthusiasts — could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and allowed to elect judges.
The Trump campaign said that the media has taken his words out of context and that he does not support violence.
Bordin’s challenge seeks compensation from the campaign for careless surveillance, as well as from Phillip for violence, abuse and causing emotional distress.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not respond immediately.
Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news subsidiary in Charlotte, reports that Phillip recently left the campaign.
His callback request to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, was not answered immediately.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s campaign has been controversial.

Britain must channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and prosperity to the whole stomach, not just to local communities and across London.
For me, this was the great charm of Heathrow, just as it was the charm of the London 2012 Games, when we went to great lengths to ensure that all our people and regions would benefit from the Games.
The Olympics brought huge benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
10 000 new traineeships and 40 000 new jobs will be created for local communities alone, and youth unemployment around the airport will be eliminated.
Just like before the London 2012 Games, some come to the conclusion that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Games and that we would be ashamed of the world.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
Obstacles are always to be overcome, but Heathrow answers every question put to it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs and <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion in economic growth, and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented an <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment programme on time and within budget: from T5, voted the best airport terminal in the world for five years in a row, to T2 built between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now the team is ready to build a third runway supported by <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion of private money.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for Great Britain, and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time for us to channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, secure the future of our trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary of the Treasury.
Adblock Plus and Facebook in a cat and mouse game about blocking ads
For companies that receive money from online advertising, attempts to bypass an ad blocking program are a "cat-and-mouse game," said one of the companies that make such a program.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blockers on its computer-facing pages, Adblock Plus posted a blog post saying that users could update program filters to block again ads on social networking pages.
On Tuesday, Facebook said the code on its website would be changed around ads to make it harder for ad blockers to detect which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says it has circumvented the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokeswoman Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of back-and-forth struggle between the open-source ad-blocking community and its vassals has been going on since ad-blocking was invented,” and that it’s possible Facebook will come up with its own solution soon.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has taken part in the battle is a strong indication of how much concern ad blockers have become for the industry.
About 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers, according to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year, nearly four times the number who used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now accounts for 84% of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
However, the company is after computer-based ad blockers, as mobile ad blockers don’t work on Facebook’s mobile apps for the social network or Instagram, the spokesperson said.
Computer ads still generate enough revenue for Facebook to consider this type of action worth investing in.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it would update its “ad preference” tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters were worrisome because they would also block some of the site’s non-advertising content.
“This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an email statement.
Ad blockers are boring tools, which is why we’ve focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
Woman hit by car on Swiss motorway after suicide
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are searching for witnesses after a woman was hit by several vehicles on a highway in the early hours of Thursday in what appears to have been a suicide.
The incident occurred on the A1 road near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman committed a "desperate act" and lay in the dark on a road where she was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim, who was clearly trying to kill herself, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the incident have already been interrogated, but not all have been identified, police said, calling on them and all eyewitnesses to report the incident.
A criminal investigation has been launched, which is a “logical” step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneva.
"It remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be prosecuted.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
That is for the prosecutor to decide,” Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years suggest that drivers are not held accountable.
In both cases - where there was a person walking in the dark on the highway - it was estimated that motorists could not expect to meet a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
Last year, police were acquitted of manslaughter for negligence after she hit and killed a man lying on A! Road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court said.
The court found that the police, who were responding to the emergency call, were driving in a justified manner, and that the man’s presence on the road was a “completely exceptional and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus was likely once habitable.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to study Venus’ past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, water-free surfaces and carbon dioxide-filled atmosphere, could ever have had Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus’ slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and it could still have rotated slowly.
The model also looked at the surface formation of early Venus.
The planet likely had areas drier than Earth, but there was once enough water and geographic variation to make life possible and protect it from rapid water evaporation.
Early Venus also had the advantage of being 30 percent dimmer than the sun.
"In a simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus reveals it to the sun from the day side for almost two months at a time," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.
This heats the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick cloud layer that acts as an umbrella to protect the surface from much of the sun’s heat.
As a result, average global temperatures are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth’s today.
The model produced a story about the evolution of Venus that is similar to what planetary scientists had previously assumed.
While Venus was probably habitable at one time or another, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over a period of several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapors burned under ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with deadly greenhouse gas effects — Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venusian climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns from Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday from the Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president for ice hockey, blaming the lack of influence in the team’s decision-making process.
Colorado’s vice president/CEO Joe Sakic confirmed the information and mentioned that the team will start looking for a new coach immediately.
“For the past three years, I have done my duty as Colorado Avalanche’s vice president of hockey and head coach with enthusiasm, passion and determination,” Roy said in a statement.
Over the summer, I have thought long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the vision of the coach and the vice president of ice hockey must be fully in line with the vision of the organization.
He must also be able to influence decisions that affect the team’s performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me today about his decision," Sakic said.
We appreciate all that he has done for the organisation and wish him the best of luck in the future.
Roy was named the winner of the Jack Adams Award for the best coach in the league for his first season with Avalanche in 2013–14.
He led the team to 112 points and a victory in the Central Division, but Minnesota defeated Colorado in the first round of the playoffs, and the team has not advanced to the playoffs in the past two years.
Avalanche's games in 2015-16 ended with 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 draws, and the team lost by five points to Wild, losing the Western Conference Wild Card playoff seat.
In the Hall of Fame, Roy won four Stanley Cups - two in both the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and postpone strike
Labor disputes over wages for North Sea oil workers will be postponed as all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the chief negotiators said.
Strikes against the oil-field service company Wood Group have occasionally taken place on drilling rigs in the North Sea, run by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and the Unite and RMT alliances can confirm that we have agreed to resume the process aimed at resolving the current dispute,” the statement read.
Over the next few weeks, we will hold several full-day meetings starting early next week so we can take a fresh perspective on the issues.
According to the trade unions, their recent industrial action, which they say is the first in more than 25 years, was a protest against possible pay cuts of up to 30%.
This year, Wood Group cut contractors’ fees in the North Sea by about 9% due to negative market pressure.
The company’s commission reduction follows a 10% reduction in the number of contractors in its shores in 2014.
The company said the additional cuts would give the company the space it needed to cope with the downturn in the market.
Shell has cut thousands of employees and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as the company eases its operations as a result of a giant merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by Britain’s decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest North Sea labour disputes of the generation.
He said that the North Sea was essential for the region's economy.
"We need an economy that works for many, not just a few, both in the North Sea and across the country," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new projects in the North Sea, while the average for the previous five years has been about $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of stars in the Pleiadian Cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete list of the star rotation speeds of the Pleiadian Cluster.
The new data will help astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at varying speeds, as well as how rotation times are related to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we will now learn more about the relationship between the star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Pasadena Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at Caltech.
The Pleiadian star cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago and are now reaching adulthood.
They are now at their highest level.
At their peak speed, these growing stars emit large amounts of stellar wind.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of stars, they slow the stars down.
As a star ages, its rotational speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star by tracking the appearance of recognizable starspots, such as sunspots.
The latest list of stellar rotation speeds suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, with the bigger ones making pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
"In the Pleiadian 'Ballet,' we see that slow spinners tend to be more massive, while the fastest spinners tend to be very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiadian star cluster is so close, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory for estimating the properties of stars at rotational speeds.
"The Pleiadian star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of star rotation that span both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, when, and why the stars slow down their rotation and, so to speak, hang their 'dancing shoes' on the nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of the rotational speeds of the Pleiades in three articles soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal.
