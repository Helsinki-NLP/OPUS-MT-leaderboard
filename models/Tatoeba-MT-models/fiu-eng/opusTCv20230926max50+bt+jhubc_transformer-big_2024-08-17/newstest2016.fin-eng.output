9-year-old boy found missing in Texas
Police have been on a search mission for a 9-year-old boy who fled Tampere on Tuesday evening.
A missing person’s report about a boy who started out with a friend in western Tampere has spread on social media.
According to the Police Situation Centre, the boy has been contacted and there is no risk to his life or health.
The boy’s father told the Ilta-Sanomat around midnight that the boy had been found.
He's fine, and now we're gonna start the follow-up.
The boy was found nearby, his father said.
Ronaldo is back, he's back, he's back, he's back, he's back.
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league over the weekend and continued to play in the Champions League.
The rivalry between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo over the Champions League goal scorer turned to the latter’s advantage, at least for a while.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo single-handedly moved to the top of the all-time goal scorer rankings when he shot visitor Shahtar Donetsk into the grid with two shots from penalties and one from the game situation.
Ronaldo scored 80 goals, while Barcelona Messi, which tied with him on Tuesday, has 77 goals.
Real won the match 4-0.
Juventus have stumbled in the Italian football league Serie A since the start of the season, but started the Champions League in Group D with a 2-1 away win over Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored just over ten minutes before the end by Alvaro Morata of Juventus.
The attack was blunted by the absence of Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the Premier League game of the weekend, did not play until the last ten minutes.
Manchester's second club, United, also had a hard time in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after a 1-2 loss.
ManU's 20-year-old defenseman Luke Shaw played only 15 minutes.
PSV's Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking glider hit the ManU deck so hard that Shaw probably broke his tibia.
Shaw lay on the lawn of Eindhoven’s home stadium for about ten minutes before the medical staff left to take him to the hospital.
Memphis Depay led the guests 1-0 in the 41st minute, but ManU’s joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno equalized before the break with extra time.
The winning goal was scored by Luciano Narsingh in the second half.
Paris Saint-Germain won the first round of the Champions League.
This was the case with Argentinean Angel Di Maria, who changed his Manchester United shirt to a PSG shirt.
Di Maria broke through from the right and picked up the ball in the back corner by Malm<0xC3><0xB6> goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani scored 2-0 for PSG in the second half.
PSG is one of the season’s most successful players.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malm<0xC3><0xB6>, one of the league's minor leagues, is not the best benchmark.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the PSG star forward, faced his starting club Malm<0xC3><0xB6> FF for the first time in his professional career.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malm<0xC3><0xB6> in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team, the Moscow CSKA, lost in a Group B match in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
Opposition party calls for immediate resignation – President makes wrong speech
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has given the same speech in the Zimbabwean Parliament that he gave at the end of last month.
Mugabe, during his 25-minute speech, apparently did not realise that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe was at full strength.
The main opposition party, the MDC, called for Mugabe to step down because he is too old to rule.
Mugabe's aides hastened to say that the confusion had occurred solely within Mugabe's headquarters and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mr Mugabe's speech was, and now is, about China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria call for emergency summit on refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have called for an extraordinary summit of EU leaders next week over the refugee crisis.
The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, will assess the request.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the heads of state should discuss cooperation with countries of origin and how to register more effectively those coming to Europe.
According to Merkel, negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are part of the home affairs ministers’ agenda.
Teacher admits to shooting girlfriend during emergency call
During an emergency call, college teacher Shannon Lamb tells the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the police must come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "golden dog" is alive and probably upset, as well as said that contact information for the deceased woman's close relatives can be found on her phone.
Inside the house, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note on the side of the notebook: “I’m so sorry I wish I could cancel this Amy I loved and she is the only woman who has ever loved me,” the letter said.
There was nothing to suggest that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Cleveland, Minnesota’s Delta State University, had already traveled nearly 500 miles to the school campus, where police believe he shot and killed the popular history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of his study.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said officers heard about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made a fatal 911 call some time after that.
By the end of the day, the death toll had risen by one more: Lamb committed suicide while police surrounded him.
Authorities were still trying to find out Lambi's motive the day after students and staff were forced to hide behind locked doors because of a school shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have released information that students and staff described Lamb as a gifted teacher who may have had problems.
The students said they had been waiting for hours.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, say Lamb had no history of violence or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote in which he thanked the "mighty people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History, which has a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students attended courses for both men.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but said he also seemed nervous and restless, "as if something was wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lambi told him he was under a lot of stress at the end of the 2014-15 school year.
Lamb had previously requested sick leave from Delta State University, saying he had some kind of health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's pay policy meant that although Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, this did not guarantee him automatic career advancement and the position of assistant professor.
William LaForge, the university's rector, said there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt as far as he knew, but that "obviously there was something in Lamb's mind."
Lamb is no longer able to answer these questions.
After Lamb fled the campus, police tracked him down as he moved back to Mississippi from the state of Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile and a half south of his parents' house in Greenville, Mississippi, according to Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
Lamb's car was still running in the driveway.
It wasn’t immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, though Johnson said he believed Lamb knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the university in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy. The university has 3,500 students and is located in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb received his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb’s old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic, and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a fun, older guy who spent many years trying to teach Hairston to play the guitar.
He was quite a charmer at the time.
All the girls were molten wax when she was there, said now 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in Jackson’s suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time.
In an emergency phone call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a riverside brick house in Gautier.
Police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and now have a 19-year-old daughter.
"She's really upset," O'Steen described her daughter.
He was his mother's best friend.
O'Steen said he had never met Lamb, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both performing at the summer market three years ago.
Later they played together in a few gigs.
O'Steen told me that her daughter is making and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainment organiser at The Julep Room, a shady bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, after Lamb had finished performing guitar and harmonica to a select audience.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We joked and played games with each other.
They were both pretty smart.
The deceased teacher, Schmidt, ran a first-year student seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the school.
Schmidt was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas, and was chairman of his fraternity and student board.
On Tuesday night, a candlelit retreat was held at the Delta State campus in Cleveland, attended by about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students, and community members.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended Mass, during which the university choir sang the songs "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
The teaching continues on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students to come back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
Now is the time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Pettus of Greenville, Mississippi and Rebecca Santana of New Orleans contributed to the report.
The case has been corrected according to the fact that the police now say that Lamb made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and that although I referred to Prentiss as his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers during the holiday season
Toys R Us says it won’t hire as many workers for the holiday season as it did last year, but a retailer of toy and baby products says existing permanent and seasonal workers will be given the opportunity to work more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, down from 45,000 during the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that interviews with applicants will begin this month, and the number of staff will increase from October to December.
Although the holiday season is months away, the Christmas shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help with the occupation of stores, as well as the sale, dispatch and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox Jokes About ‘Dating’ With Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future was a hugely important moment for Michael J. Fox.
This was also important for personal reasons.
“We sat in the theater waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realized that the seat I was sitting next to was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana’s place was next to mine,” she said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary Back in Time.
The film starts and it occurs to me that I am just a fake stroke and a hand stretch away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about Back to the Future, which interviewed Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and production director Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, “For me, it’s without a doubt the greatest time travel movie of all time.”
Back in Time will be available as a video on demand, on DVD and in some cinemas in October.
UN chief says Syria will not be solved by military means
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s response to Russia’s increased military support to Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict “will not be resolved militarily” and that additional weapons will only exacerbate the violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN leader again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support non-discriminatory negotiations for a political solution.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Ban said he would meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent member states - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - in the margins of the General Assembly ministerial week later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and regional powers "has made the situation impossible to resolve."
Mr Ban called on the five permanent Member States to show the solidarity and consensus they showed when agreeing on Iran's nuclear programme when dealing with the Syrian crisis.
8 polls that show Donald Trump is serious
Some have tried to brand him as a windmill.
Some people think he's just a joke.
Some are waiting for collapse.
While some Republicans have tried to drag Donald Trump out of the polls, it hasn’t (yet) succeeded.
Of the last 11 national polls, 10 Donald Trumps have been in the lead with a double-digit figure, and some have begun to seriously consider what this means in terms of the real estate king’s nomination prospects.
Of course, the election period is only at an early stage.
These results do not mean that Trump is likely to become a Republican candidate.
Commentators note that at this point in 2011, Rick Perry was losing his lead to the rising Herman Cain, neither of whom won any state in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in the general election.
However, outside groups such as Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic organization Club for Growth have noted Trump’s tenacity and have begun to use their funds to overthrow him.
The following recent poll results suggest that the real estate king is not just a passing phase:
Trump’s popularity figures have made a U-turn.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, polls at Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans were in favor of the property king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52%.
Six out of ten Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they are negative.
These figures are also true in the first pre-election states.
In a poll conducted by Quinnipiac University in Iowa last week, 60 percent of Republicans said they welcomed Trump.
Two-thirds of Republicans would be happy if Trump were elected.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either “enthusiastic” or “satisfied” if Trump were a candidate.
Only two in ten said they would be “shocked” if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson is more or less as enthusiastic as Trump (43 percent “enthusiastic” vs. Trump’s 40 percent).
The next most exciting?
Marco Rubio, only 21%.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters would be “disappointed” or “shocked” if the incumbent’s favorite, Jeb Bush, became a candidate.
Trump’s fiery nature is not a problem for most Republicans.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his pompous speeches and insults, according to Monday’s ABC News/Washington Post poll, 52 percent of Republican-leaning voters at the national level think the property king has the temperament for a president.
According to a Quinnipiac poll last week, in Iowa, the state hosting the first party congress, the figure is the same: 52 percent of Republicans think Trump has the temperament for a leader.
However, according to an ABC/Post poll, 44 percent think his character is unfit to serve as president, and nearly six in ten think his character does not belong in the White House.
Republican voters are getting used to it.
When Republican voters think like the commentators, they think Trump is the real option.
According to a CNN/ORC poll, four out of ten thought Trump was the most likely candidate to be nominated for the Republican nomination.
At the end of July, four out of ten voted for Jeb Bush.
Disclosure: Republican voters have not always had access to the brightest crystal ball possible.
In the last term, four in ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would be nominated, and only 28 percent supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican voters believe Trump’s campaign is credible.
Even if the Republicans backed another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmented field is likely to have promoted Trump’s leadership, as anti-Trump support is split among a number of other candidates.
However, a poll conducted by Monmouth University in early September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump receives majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with 33 points each.
He's tied with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate for Trump?
If they were pitted against each other, Ben Carson would beat Trump by 18 points.
A majority of Donald Trump supporters have said they have made a decision.
A new CBS/NYT poll Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of Trump voters have decided who their votes will go to.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can say with absolute certainty that he will never change his mind.
46% said they could possibly change candidates.
In any case, Trump’s biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made the decision are twice as likely to be on Trump’s side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called Mexican immigrants “rapists” in his campaign kickoff speech, immigration has been at the center of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump’s pompousness is driving Latino voters further away from the Republican Party and harming rebranding efforts.
According to a new ABC/Post poll published on Monday, six in ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of things, so is Donald Trump.
Frustration with the government has reached a new peak.
Support for Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of Republican voters, largely because of their position outside of politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said in a Monday’s ABC/Post poll that they would rather choose someone from outside politics than someone with government experience.
They are also angry with the federal government.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54 percent are “satisfied” and 21 percent are “really angry.”
Jeremy Corbyn's first appearance during Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first appearance in Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election.
Labour’s new leader Jeremy Corbyn will face Prime Minister David Cameron for the first time.
Corbyn will rise to ask his first of six questions shortly after noon, and it is likely that both the media and Labour MPs will be watching his performance closely.
Corbyn has called for “less theatre and more facts” for this weekly show.
He has also said that he could leave some of the events to his colleagues.
This encounter is the first parliamentary test of Corbyn's leadership since he was appointed to the shadow government and spoke at the trade union confederation's annual meeting on Tuesday.
At the same time, the Labour leader's decision to stand quietly during the national anthem at Tuesday's memorial service, which was held on the 75th anniversary of the Battle for Britain air war, has sparked criticism among Conservative MPs and featured in several front-page stories.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem
A Corbyn spokesman said he had "standing respectfully in silence" and that he recognized "the Royal Air Force's bravery in the British air war."
Owen Smith, a member of Corbyn’s shadow government, told BBC Two Newsnight that he would have urged the Labour leader to sing the national anthem, even though he thought the royal house should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to be part of Corbyn's inner circle, citing disagreements over economic, defence and foreign affairs, with less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party initially supporting him as leader.
BBC Policy Correspondent Robin Brant says policy differences over the party's status in the European Union and the government's aid ceiling have "stacked" within the Labour Party since Corbyn's appointment.
Corbyn told a trade union meeting that Labour would propose a change that would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, the shadow government’s Secretary of Labor and Pensions stated that the party was “quite clear” that they were only opposed to the government’s plans to lower the ceiling from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Corbyn will become the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has faced in the past decade as leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader has promised a new approach to politics and now says he has "crowded" ideas into questions for the Prime Minister and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
Islington North MP Corbyn has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational in nature and that he will refrain from both witty rhetoric and quips, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow government's finance secretary, will substitute for him during Question Time when Corbyn is not attending - for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corbyn has also suggested that other colleagues should be allowed to speak at some point, and he has said that he has approached the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, on this issue.
When Cameron took the lead in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the kind of political theatre that is often associated with Prime Minister Question Time, but he later had to admit that he had failed.
Since they began to be televised in 1990, the Prime Minister’s Question Time has been an important indicator of the leader’s discretion, his control of the House of Commons, and his position among other members of parliament, even though critics have criticized Question Time as becoming a travesty that requires far-reaching reforms.
Photographed in Joburg: Homeless youth are being trained to be photographers
Johannesburg city centre is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and earn a living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a nonprofit studio where homeless youth are taught how to take photos of their neighborhood and make a profit from it.
BBC News met one of the first young people to graduate from the project.

The value of the pound rises as UK wage growth accelerates
The value of the pound jumped up after the numbers showed an increase in the UK’s wage growth, while at the same time the FTSE 100 index rose with the SABMiller.
Between May and July, UK wages excluding bonuses rose by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The rate of growth was the fastest since 2009 and was considered to bring with it estimates of rising rates.
The pound rose more than one percent against the dollar to $1,5505, and 0.84% against the euro to 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 closed with a 1.49% increase to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinctive stock on the market and rose by 20 % after being approached by competitor AB InBev with an offer.
The agreement would link the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry’s stock rose 0.9 percent after the rival luxury product group Richmont received encouraging news.
Richemont’s latest sales figures were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China – which is Burberry’s key market – had started to grow again.
Glencore shares rose 5 percent after the mining giant said it had raised $2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt-cutting strategy.
Shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the index’s largest-grossing company by 4.3 percent after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation of the company to “sell.”
JD Sports rose 3.1 percent after the sportswear company announced six-month pre-tax earnings: an 83% increase to <0xC2><0xA3>46.6 million.
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Salaries Could Harm Expansion
Peter Cowgill, president of JD Sports, said raising the minimum wage in the UK could mean "potential consumers will have more purchasing power".
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the company’s higher labour costs, Cowgill notes.
The costs could be related to the company’s expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash launches grassroots campaign against Aldi intrusion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA trades from Aldi's invasion of southern and western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in southern and western Australia before Aldi’s $700 million attack.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers as well as its first store early next year in Southern and Western Australia, with up to 120 stores in the pipeline. Meanwhile, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food vendors and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing, as well as events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA merchants and suppliers have jumped in, and brands like Dunsborough ice cream maker Simmo's are offering tastings at IGA stores, and store owners are selling discounted tickets to Australian football matches to their regular customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details about its defense strategy on September 29, as this food, alcohol and hardware wholesaler hosts its annual Investor Strategy Day.
There is a lot at stake, as Southern and Western Australia together account for almost 30% of Metcash’s IGA trading territory, with higher profit margins than the IGA network in the eastern states of Metcash.
Shoppers in South and West Australia are known to be parochial, with IGA retailers having a much higher market share than New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30% in the South and 24% in the West, compared to 14% in the East.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will capture about 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the first stores opening.
In a report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA dealers could lose $360 million annually on sales and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in the south and 30 in the west next year, generating $500 million and $600 million in revenue in these areas.
The loss of food and food sales and volumes at Metcash’s high fixed-cost base could cost Metcash about $13 million in operating profit losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the Eastern Länder mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent study by Roy Morgan found that IGA customers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash’s food and food sales will fall by 3.8% in 2016; 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, so that its market share will fall from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, manager of a leading investment fund and founder of Magellan Financial Group, said during a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could “very possibly lose in a decade.”
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglass’ comments.
However, it is understood that a member of the Metcash board would have contacted Douglass last week.
Since 2010, IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 % to 14 %, and profits from Metcash’s food and food business, which distributes products to around 1200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 % since 2012, reflecting a reduction in the debt financing of operations as sales and margins are under pressure.
However, the wholesaler stands his ground, and has invested more than $150 million annually in bringing prices of hundreds of products weekly down to par with those of Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA retailers refurbish stores by adding more fast-growing fresh food, and bringing a better range of private label products to the market.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice says that lowering prices and improving stores have increased the appeal, and he hopes the wholesaler will return to the path of revenue growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Australian Tennis Federation President Steve Healy backs Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more credit than criticism for her behavior
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered as a bystander in a recent storm that has been raging around her friend Nick Kyrgios. She deserves credit rather than criticism for her own behaviour, says Steve Healy, president of the Australian Tennis Federation.
The younger member of the talented duo called "Special Ks", Kokkinakis, was inadvertently exposed after Kyrgios angered Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Shortly thereafter, in a fiery qualifier match in Cincinnati, the Chief Judge was forced twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison when Harrison declared, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten that brat."
Although Kokkinakis was last seen breaking his club after a cramp ruined his potential win over Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Healy has been a staunch defender of Kokkinakis.
Right now, the young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth for another position in the doubles with Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"I think quite strongly that Thanasi has just been dragged into the ruckus," Healy said.
He broke his racket when he lost because of a cramp at the US Open, but he’s not the first player to break his racket in frustration, and I know Thanas well enough to know that he’s not proud of that.
But he has behaved extremely well, even in quite provocative situations at the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He’s got a great team around him, he’s got a great family around him and I think he’s been treated a little bit harshly.
He is very mature to 19 years old, he works hard, fits into the team and so on, and he has never had any problems with other players. He is appreciated in the locker room, he trains hard, he is in good shape and he is quite a calm and mature young man, and I think he should be judged on his merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Kyrgios in the important games starting on Friday, describing this "common decision" as a good solution for everyone, but still supporting the return of the Canberran to the team's regular equipment.
"We want the team to be fully focused on the games and not all the controversy around [Kyrgyz]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen really fast, as Federer and Murray, for example, have pointed out, and he is growing up in public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received. However, we are trying to support him, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe it is best for both the team and him if he spends some time out of the public eye contemplating these consequences.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border with Serbia, detaining those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of damming the flow of migrants entering the country.
At the border, chaos ensued as hundreds of migrants gathered in neutral territory, and the Serbian authorities reacted with consternation.
People who were fleeing violence in their countries of origin have now pitched their tents and settled on a stretch of road between checkpoints in two countries for an indefinite period of time.
The frustration, however, increased.
With a police helicopter hovering over them, the migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared that it is “unacceptable” to return migrants from Hungary, as more and more migrants are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not cause harm to civilians.
We need to have a dialogue with other countries and with Brussels in the next few days," Dacic said in Prague.
The turmoil at the Hungarian-Serbian border came after a group of 28 failed to create a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the division of responsibilities for the 40 000 asylum-seekers who have now taken over Italy and Greece, and spoke optimistically about reaching a final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - on which EU countries will take an additional 120 000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for an extra EU summit next week to discuss the continent’s migration crisis.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will act in the near future.
The state of emergency in the two southern regions on Tuesday gave the authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis and made it possible to close roads and speed up asylum cases.
Meanwhile, Hungary’s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence on Serbia’s border is ready, the country will also erect a barbed-wire fence on part of its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to complete a barbed-wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the biggest bottleneck and entry point to the European Union for refugees, many of whom are fleeing war in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that most of the arrivals are economic refugees seeking a better life, not people fleeing war who are entitled to protection - a view that is in stark contrast to other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now define as a criminal offence an attempt to cross or damage a 4-metre (13-foot) barbed-wire fence built by the government on the southern border with Serbia, and include longer prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"In view of the situation caused by mass immigration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear on this: crossing the border illegally is a crime.
Parliament still has to formally approve the military deployment expected for next week, but journalists from the Associated Press at the border have been seeing heavily armed military personnel with their vehicles and dogs for days.
Orban’s national security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said authorities had arrested 45 people trying to cross the border and 15 who had already crossed the border.
They got over it by damaging the fence, are now in police custody, and are accused of the offences defined in the new laws.
The authorities will fix the fence quickly.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossings along the Serbian border after sending a barbed-wire train to close one of the crossings.
The main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, was shrouded in chaos when Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for handling people and crowds tried to cram inside.
About 20 got in, but thousands were left out.
One group of migrants blocked the main highway between Serbia and Hungary, saying they would refuse food and drink until they were allowed to come to Hungary.
2016 Election: A National Survey Says Hillary Clinton’s Lead to Bernie Sanders Has Narrowed Out on the Side
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to lead a two-figure Democratic nomination race, but Senator Bernie Sanders blackmails her.
Clinton is now supported by 47 percent of Democrats (down from 58 percent) and Sanders is supported by 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will run for president, but he is backed by 15 percent of Democrats.
More than five months before the primary, the majority of Democrats say it is too early to say who they will vote for.
Clinton’s supporters, however, stand behind their own choice more firmly than those of other candidates.
Clinton’s popularity has plummeted in several segments of the population since last month’s CBS News Poll, and at the same time Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is a strong leader among women and moderates, but her leadership has narrowed.
His popularity among men has plummeted, and Sanders is only five percentage points behind.
Clinton’s lead among under-50 Democrats has been lost, and she is now on par with Sanders.
Clinton, however, clearly leads with older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders with a double-digit figure among the liberals, but now Sanders is leading this group by five percentage points.
About half of the country’s Democratic voters say they will be eager to support Clinton if he becomes the party’s candidate.
A quarter say they support him with some reservations, and 15% would support him just because he is a candidate.
Six percent would not support him at all.
Not surprisingly, Clinton’s current supporters are very likely eager to support her.
Opinions are more mixed for those who do not currently support Clinton - only a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters say they would support Clinton enthusiastically, fewer Republicans (35 percent) say the same about Republican No. 1 Donald Trump.
When Clinton supporters were asked in an open question why they wanted her as a candidate, the most popular answer was that she had the right experience (16 percent). After that, the most popular answers were that now is the right time for a female president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
With the vice president influencing a possible presidential nomination, 57 percent of Democrats would like to see him already in the race — though a third disagree.
When asked by Democrats who they would choose for a second party nomination, Biden is the most popular choice.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half say they would choose Biden, who is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hilary Clinton's leadership of Sanders will increase. If Biden joins, the leadership will be 20 percentage points, but if Biden withdraws, the figure will be 30.
Fifty-five percent of Democrats believe Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but that number has fallen from 78 percent last month.
By this measure, Biden is far behind, but the proportion of those who consider him the most deserving to vote has increased.
However, when asked what was most important to the candidate, Democratic voters put opinions ahead of being able to vote.
Also last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate was seen as an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates do well on certain key issues among their party’s voters.
Most people think of Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden does best in honesty, while Clinton’s strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democrats say they don’t think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent say they don’t have an opinion about Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are ideologically in agreement.
When you look at all of these things, about a quarter of Democrats say they don’t have an opinion about Sanders.
While questions remain about Hillary Clinton’s personal email address and server use while she was Secretary of State, most Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation and say it didn’t affect their general opinion of her.
However, it is different when we look at America as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided in March, shortly after the matter came to light.
The majority of Americans say their overall opinion of Clinton was not affected by email polemics, although 36 percent say their opinion of her has deteriorated.
More than six in 10 Republicans say their opinion of Clinton has gotten worse.
While Clinton’s own party voters consider her to be honest and trustworthy, this is still a problem for her among all registered voters. Only 32% consider her to be honest and trustworthy, a figure that has fallen by 8 percentage points since last month and 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say they don’t think Clinton is honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country also don’t think Trump is honest and trustworthy.
Both Clinton and Trump are considered good leaders.
Of the six candidates involved in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered to be honest, but many people have no opinion of him, just like Carson.
The margin of error in a survey of 351 Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in national poll
Ben Carson comes close to Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
In a new poll, two candidates gathered half of all the votes, leaving the others to fight for a foothold.
Republican voters across the country remain strongly in favor of Trump, whose support has risen from 23 percent of the previous CBS poll, released Tuesday prior to last month’s Fox News election debate, to 27 percent.
At the same time, Carson rose from 6% to 23%.
The poll also found that Carson is doing well among different demographic groups and is ousting Trump from the ranks of highly educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field is lagging behind, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasichi, with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support falling the most, from 10 percent last month to the current 2 percent.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are tied for third place at 6 percent.
The margin of error in this latest poll of 376 Republican voters, conducted in September, is +/- 6 percent.
A recent CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson to be on the rise in polls: he has 19 percent support among Republicans, and Trump is ahead of him by 32 percent.
According to a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll, Trump was far ahead of Carson.
As Carson’s popularity grew last week, Trump criticized the retired neurosurgeon in vain, even though Carso apologized for questioning Trump’s faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during a campaign visit to Iowa.
Five Brotherhood Members Accused of Death of First-Year Student at Baruch College
Nearly two years after a student died at a frat house in the Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, a murder charge has been brought against five people.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood of Baruch College in New York City brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng during a membership rite in September 2013, and then delayed his hospitalization, thereby contributing to his death, police said.
Officials say Deng’s eyes were tied and his back was loaded with a 13-pound backpack full of sand, after which he was repeatedly tackled to the ground as he attempted to walk through an icy field toward the finish line.
In the end, Deng complained that his head hurt, after which he lost consciousness.
The Brotherhood members did not call 911 after Deng fainted, but were accused of waiting for an hour before bringing him to the hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Deng’s clothes, search online for information about his symptoms, and contact the Brotherhood’s national president, Andy Meng, for advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide their ritual equipment and thus virtually put the welfare of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng," Wagner said.
Deng could not be revived, and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng received repeated blunt force trauma to the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been affected by the fratricidal fraternity, with at least one student dying as a result every year since 1970," Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement.
The fraternity and its members must be held to account, and this step by the authorities is important.
Monroe County Grand Jury Proposes Charges of Third-degree Murder for the First Five Members
Thirty-two other Brotherhood members, including Meng, are also facing charges of complicity and criminal collusion.
"We do not want to hold only individuals accountable, and if there is an organisation that has officially or informally accepted the situation, then they must also be held accountable," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the Brotherhood, and the National Brotherhood disbanded contact with the local branch.
This Is What Happens When the Federal Reserve Raises Interest Rates
Interest rate hikes will come, and the market for rising rates will crash, bond yields will rise, and the economy will be forced into recession.
We know this.
What we don’t know is how long this will take or how long it will take.
The past doesn’t help much in terms of timing, especially when it comes to the economy.
After the first drawdown, the recession has sometimes lasted only 11 months, while others have lasted as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates has often, but not always, been a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
That’s why Federal Reserve officials have so vigorously stressed that investors should not focus on it when interest rates start to rise, but rather on the trajectory of the time it takes for the situation to normalize.
There are several variables in the equation.
In the end, however, market participants can see that all the fuss about raising interest rates has been oversized.
“The central bank’s first post-global financial crisis hike will inevitably be interpreted in some circles as the end of the ‘cheap money’ era,” said Julian Jessop, chief financial officer for global affairs at Capital Economics, in a message to clients.
What we do not expect is that the gradual return of US interest rates to normal, albeit still low, levels will be the kind of upheaval that many seem to fear.
This does not mean, however, that it has no effect.
Below is an overview of how some sectors of the economy will react to past developments:
As the market has seen in the last month or so, waiting for an interest rate hike can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
“It appears that the return on capital tends to stagnate for 12 to 24 months after the first hike, potentially reflecting a delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the central bank hike.
More specifically, over the past about 35 years, the market tends to be strong, with an increase of about 14 percent as you approach a raise, 250 days after the situation is fairly steady (an average increase of 2.6 percent), and normalcy has been reached after 500 days with an average return of 14.4% in the last six cycles, reports Bob Doll, chief capital strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, in a recent analysis published in the journal Barron.
According to Deutsche Bank, the impact on equities is generally more pronounced at a later stage of the increase cycle, when yields start to fall.
Recessions are part of the economy, but interest rate hikes often contribute to their return.
In the current situation, the central bank is facing certain challenges that did not exist in the past and which can accelerate the recession.
This is particularly true of gross domestic product, which will be closest to its all-time low before the central bank raises interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 increases since 1950, nominal annual GDP has been less than 4.5% only twice.
While the figure for the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect it to remain as the third quarter has advanced by 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economic situation can be risky and raise the question of whether "this time will be different", Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been preparing for a central bank raise throughout the year, and all are looking forward to this week’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which will close on Thursday.
While many strategists and financial experts believe that the committee can approve a raise at this meeting, futures trading only predicts a 25% probability.
"Our study shows that since 1950, all upward cycles have so far occurred in supercycles of increasing leverage, with GDP passing its pre-recession peaks very quickly after recovery has begun," the report says.
In contrast, the recovery from the recession, which was the worst of the period of observation, has been exceptionally slow.
In the current cycle, the central bank has waited by far the longest since the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and it is now the 74th month.
Fixed income has also been volatile as the market waits for an interest rate increase, and the model bears some resemblance to the observations made on capital.
The main difference is that when the central bank changes its policy, its effects are seen more quickly in bonds than in shares.
The direction of bond yields appears to change immediately at the first increase/cut of the cycle.
At the end of the raise cycle, the yield on the bonds immediately drops," said Deutsche Bank.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that raising interest rates will cause longer-term and shorter-term bond yields to converge, thereby smoothing the yield curve.
High-yield bonds often perform better in such a situation, although "we are still cautious about looking for a return," said Kathy Jones, Schwab's fixed-yield analyst, in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adjusted to the central bank’s policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the outlook for tighter monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is smoother, credit margins have increased and volatility has increased – all of these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its stance.
Generally speaking, companies whose business is mainly based in the United States will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies that have a lot of debt perform worse when the rise in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than what they have finance.
"History shows that 'high-quality' stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months following the first interest rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report aimed at customers.
After increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, firms with strong turnover overtook firms with weak turnover by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatility stocks performed better than lower quality companies, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt is going to be a big problem.
Those companies with high variable-rate debt are losing the most, Goldman said.
Outside of stock market speculation, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from the appreciation of the dollar.
Savers can also make a profit from higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly the effect will be felt.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accuses the channel of "popularity"
He claims that it will become increasingly difficult to separate it from a commercial competitor
In addition, he targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying that they were just imitations of the Brit Awards.
Fellow MP Damien Collins criticized The Voice for not being original
BBC Radio 3 is "transforming" into Classic FM, claims a leading MP, adding to the production company's pressure to prove that it is doing something that commercial production companies are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC executives that a public service radio station appeared to "populate" its content and that it was becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish it from a commercial competitor.
“It seems that Radio 3 — I don’t want to use the term ‘popularity’ — is turning into Classic FM,” he said.
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, which launched last December.
“The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, seem to be just another Brit Awards under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different, here are two examples I can remember directly, when you’re actually just copying something that’s already on the market,” Bingham said.
BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and information for citizens.
Radio 3 teaches me things about classical music that I can’t learn anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and making music is, in fact, first-rate.
“I also think it’s really important that Radio 3 is committed to discovering new music and ordering new works,” he said.
Earlier this year, the head of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel had to do more work than before to reach the audience because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's offering that was criticised for stepping on the toes of commercial competitors during the hearing of the Committee on Culture, the Media and Sport.
Conservative Tory MP Damien Collins criticised The Voice, a music competition bought by the BBC from Dutch production company Talpa Media for an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed because it is neither original nor in any way distinctive?
Lord Hall claimed that the BBC1 show, starring Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced "in the style of the BBC".
He added that he wants the production company to "find success from the inside" the next time it starts an entertainment series.
However, he refused to prevent future seasons of The Voice from being produced, or to order the money of the licensees to be used for other entertainment formats.
Online sales grew the least in August so far, Black Friday may be the reason
Online sales increased by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
Last month’s rise was the lowest since the statistics began in 2000.
Three years ago, online sales strengthened the use of mobile devices to make purchases
Experts believe that Black Friday in November may curb consumption
Virtual shopping has grown exponentially for more than a decade, transforming many of Britain’s shopping streets into ghost towns.
However, experts say there are now signs of a flattening of online sales, with the latest figures showing only a 7 percent increase over the first quarter of 2015.
Total consumption in August grew the least since the statistics began in 2000: only five per cent more than last year.
Experts say there are signs of a smoothing out of online sales, with the latest figures showing only a 7 percent increase over the first quarter of 2015.
"If you look at the growth rates of previous years and go back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would rationalize over time," Andy Mulcahy, a provider of the JMRG sales index, told The Guardian.
He explained that three years ago, online sales strengthened as shoppers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that more people were shopping online, and that they could be done in different environments, such as on the couch.
But now it's leveling off, and (growth) can fall.
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, has been considered one of the reasons behind the slowing trades.
Experts believe that consumers will curb their purchases before the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers flocked to their computers to catch deals, crashing the websites of many merchants.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which caused shoppers to argue about the findings, can curb shopping
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one in five pounds was spent online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of using fashion chains on the shopping streets.
Muslims Bury Those Who Died in Mecca’s Crane Accident, Consequences for Bin Laden’s Family
Muslims Carry 29 Dead Bodies Across Streets During First Funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the collapse on the Saudi Binladin Group.
The Health Ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured when the crane collapsed.
The 29 dead were carried through the streets in the air as hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them, and the victims died when the crane collapsed in the Grand Mosque of Mecca.
The mourners, mainly dressed in white, filled the route to honor the first of the dead who made their last journey to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The sad procession passed the holy place where, just a few days ago, a crane fell through the roof of the mosque and overthrew the worshipers.
The bodies were released for burial after the King of Saudi Arabia blamed the Bin Laden family construction group for the disaster, which also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 of the worshipers killed by a fallen crane in the Grand Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets
Among the dead was Qasim Akram, a father of four children from Bolton, Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have already vowed that the hajj in Mecca will continue as thousands continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that Binladin Group should not have left the crane arm up when it was not in use.
The Arabic version of the ruling, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse.
The news agency’s English-language service did not mention this detail, but it said that the company’s executives have been banned from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to find out what caused the crane to fall in the courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered before the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not published any information about the collapse of the crane, and its representatives have not been caught for comment.
The royal decision also accused the group of not using up-to-date safeguards and not cooperating with the meteorological authorities.
Around the Grand Mosque of Mecca are dozens of cranes that are part of a huge building loot led by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to the Saudi ruling family for decades, and it is leading major construction projects.
The late leader of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a rebellious son whose family banned him in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in windy and rainy weather just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that every capable Muslim must do at least once in his life.
Authorities say 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities ordered one million rials (174,000 pounds) to be paid to the relatives of the dead as well as to the permanently injured.
The injured will receive half of this amount.
B&Q boss says cheap workers in Eastern Europe are the reason for the popularity
Britons are increasingly using the services of assistants, says Veronique Laury
The number of professionals coming from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a result, professional Screwfix stores will open 200 more
Meanwhile, Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q stores across the country.
Written by Rupert Steiner, the city's chief correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to be giving up their hammers and paintbrushes and prefer to hire skilled Eastern European workers to do home repairs.
It seems that if you’re handy with a hammer or have a go at painting walls, you’re now in the minority.
Britons are hiring more and more assistants to do do-it-yourself work in their homes, according to the company boss behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a chain of home improvement stores, said the popularity was due to the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at a discounted price.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new worker-oriented Screwfix stores and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said she wants more women to work in B&Q stores because eight out of every ten store purchase decisions are made by the fairer sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: there are now more one-woman households doing more home improvement work than before.
Laury said, "Most of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to find a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of product purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process.”
Laury is one of only five women to lead major companies in the UK’s FTSE100 index. She has rebuilt her management team to include an equal number of male and female fellows.
Kingfisher is almost the only company with exactly 50 percent women in its group, including its CEO and Chief Financial Officer.
Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is important here.
It has not been difficult to find good women for the management team."
Kingfisher reported a decline in both six-month returns and sales after the group took over the cost of closing stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new stores
The three aces government decided to resort to coercive legislation to save the country’s economy.
Visible effects were seen quite quickly.
The sharp heads of the SAK and other wage-earners’ central organisations began to be forced immediately, and as a result, the country stands on Friday due to the large-scale demonstration of the workers.
A lot of people think it makes sense too.
Ask them if they want to go on strike when things are going badly.
There is even a resistance movement.
More than 50,000 people have already gone online to say that they will not take part in the demonstration but will go to work.
In the good old days, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet to protest, but to openly declare oneself a scab would have been a political suicide for a small person.
The protests of a few tens of thousands of trade unions, which have a million members, do not give much cause for thought, but they do give cause for thought.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as self-evident as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed
From the point of view of the interest of the trade union movement, the government’s drastic decisions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
For years, things have seemed to be rolling on their own, but now the unions are finally getting to the point, which is to defend the rights of workers, visibly and properly.
In this way, the government may wish to strengthen the role of the trade union movement, as membership in the trade union may be seen as more necessary than before.
Whatever one may think of the actions of the organisations, it is nonsense that a demonstration on Friday would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
Industrial production, for example, has been falling for 31 consecutive months.
Gross domestic product will continue to decline and unemployment will rise.
These things should force everyone’s mind.
The University of Lappeenranta has a hard budget: the goal is to save 8.5 million euros, and personnel will be reduced by 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology starts a savings cycle with the goal of reducing costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start co-operation negotiations concerning the entire personnel, with an annual savings target of 6.5 million.
In practice, this means the reduction of approximately 130 employees.
In addition, another two million will be saved from other operations.
The co-operation negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which forecasts a deficit of 8.5 million in actual operations.
It is also affected by the cuts made by the Government.
During this financial year, the university will make a deficit of approximately 2.6 million.
The costs will increase slightly for next year, but at the same time the funding received from the Ministry will be reduced by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the university is approximately 85 million euros, so the savings target is ten per cent of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive cuts in education and research and the decrease in corporate funding is very significant for our university,” says Rector Anneli Pauli.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in supplementary funding is visible in new proportions.
Negotiations with the shop stewards will begin on Tuesday next week and will last for six weeks as prescribed by law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finland on the railways
The owner of Onnibus, Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company also targets rail traffic in Finland.
I am very interested in taking part in Finnish rail traffic.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest rail companies in the UK, Souter says.
Rail transport is to be gradually opened up to competition.
The first will be commuter traffic in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in 2017-2018.
After commuter traffic, there is long-distance traffic.
Souter says he's already approached the Department of Transportation.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes Onnibus’s plans.
Of other international companies, at least Transdev (formerly Veolia) has expressed its interest in rail transport, which also has bus services in Finland and rail services elsewhere in Europe.
The Federal Reserve has to decide on interest rates.
The rest of the world is watching as the U.S. Federal Reserve meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
When Reuters polled 80 economists, little more than half of those who still believed last week that the central bank would raise interest rates now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and interest rates will be kept at the current level of 0-0.25 percent.
This is a historic event, as it is seven years since the central bank cut interest rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a central bank has the opportunity to get out of zero and start normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has performed relatively well, and the recovery has brought trillions of dollars to the balance sheets and created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
It has warned the markets that they need to be ready for a raise, but there are signs that they also believe the odds are against the raise.
The decision will be made public on Thursday at 20:00 (CET).
Delta State University Shooter Leaves Apology Message
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning—before shooting his colleague later that day—Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he was “sorry” for the first murder and hoped “he could call it off,” authorities said Tuesday.
The Mississippi Gautier Police Department reported that Lamb, a geography and social sciences teacher at Delta State University, called 911 around 10:00 a.m.
He told me on Monday that he had shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police must send officers to his home.
He said he “killed his wife last night” and also mentioned that there is a “sweet dog” in the house that “doesn’t bother anyone,” but is probably upset.
The police asked him his name, but he didn’t tell them.
Lamb gave no explanation for the shooting.
When police arrived, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note from 45-year-old Lamb, which read: "I'm so sorry I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me.”
After writing the note, Lamb drove nearly 500 kilometers to Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt, before finally killing himself late Monday when he was besieged by police.
William LaForge, the university's rector, said there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt as far as he knew, but that "obviously there was something in Lamb's mind."
Authorities said on Tuesday that despite Monday's revelations that Lamb believed Prentiss was involved with Schmidt, there was "no information or evidence" of any "triangle" of any kind.
Shawn O'Steen said he had been married to Prentiss for about seven years and described her as "a good person".
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O’Steen said she and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who was “shocked.”
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "all the best of friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked online from home, and according to the Sun Herald, Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles reported that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
Police said Lambi called his relatives at some point on Monday to tell them that "he's not going to jail."
When police reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car, left it, and ran into the woods, where he shot himself.
Lamb defended his doctoral dissertation in education at Delta State in the spring of 2015, according to a curriculum vitae found on the university’s website.
The Stars That Lost Their Charm
The actor (on the left), pictured with his son Redmond (on the right), has had a rough few years.
In 2001, he was diagnosed with leukemia, and in 2009, his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, died of cancer.
He is also said to have had drug problems and was arrested in 2008 for drug possession.
All of this really takes its toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw has been out for months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture in his right leg after Manchester United lost to PSV Eindhoven in a Champions League match.
Although the defender was left in tears and will be out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by Héctor Moreno's reckless tackle in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw crashed into PSV territory.
He was treated for nine minutes in the field and had to be given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture on his leg, and he's in the hospital now."
He will be transferred tomorrow, or maybe the day after that, and then cut in Manchester.
"He comes to Manchester United at the age of 18, he's in trouble and then he's playing great and this is what's going to happen.
When I was in the locker room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but the double fracture will take at least six months, and he won't play in the group stage.
I hope he gets to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky to get a red card and a penalty shot.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not penalize a Mexican player.
Mr Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official was mistaken.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say that it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-foot tackle.
Shaw tweeted: “Thank you all for your messages, words are not enough to tell you how disappointed I am, my recovery is starting now, I will come back stronger.”

The English defender will have an additional incentive to recover from next June's European Championships in France.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a really bad injury."
If a player gets out because of an injury like this, everyone is very sad.
It is never the intention of our players to offend an opponent.
Moreno's leg was broken when he played for Mexico's Van Gaal against the Netherlands at the 2014 World Cup.
“Moreno takes this hard because the intention is not to hurt an opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, that’s a bad thing,” Cocu said.
I didn't see him in that situation.
The only thing I saw was a ball going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] touched it, but I didn’t see Luke tackle.
Moreno told SBS6, "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this kind of thing can be.
I feel terrible about this, I'm so sorry."
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to hospital after Chris Smalling sued him.
David Cameron knows Lorax better than this, right?
Every parent will soon learn one thing: If your child loves a book, it won’t be long before you almost memorize it.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When the holiday childcare service asked the prime minister about his favorite children’s book, he chose Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax, an environmental story published in 1971.
The choice was tricky, Cameron writes in a post posted on the SuperCamps website and continues: “Fun, moving, creative and with a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my kids because it always feels like there’s a picture or message we’ve never seen before.”
All of this is true, but the next paragraph, in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book, is a summary of the 2012 film version, in which new characters and details were added to fill a rather short original text.
“In the walled city of Tarville, where all nature is gone and even air is a commodity, Ted hopes to win the girl of his dreams over by fulfilling Audrey’s wish to see the real tree,” the text says and describes a love story not written by Dr. Seuss, who died in 1991.
If that’s not suspicious enough, Cameron’s text sometimes sounds like it’s taken from the Lorax movie’s plot summary on the Internet Movie Database website, which begins as follows: “In the walled city of Tarville, where everything is artificial and even air is a commodity, Ted boy hopes to win the heart of his dream Audrey girl.”
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so ignorant of the plot of the book. In it, a young, nameless boy hears how the local nature has been destroyed by the greedy, wood-hugging and weaving Kerskanen, ignoring the short, moustache creature Lorax who gave the story his name, who "speaks for the trees".
Such a relatively invisible PR task is probably outsourced to an assistant, who apparently has never read a book 20 times in a row to a child.
A spokesman for the prime minister said the text must have come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron’s staff, but did not comment further at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being sidelined from England, but it was still a tough one.
Playing against Pakistan in the UAE is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for the tour, I don’t think it’s likely that the last 3-0 series loss will be repeated.
I wouldn't rule out a guest win.
Alastair Cook’s side may be less experienced than the team of three years ago, but it’s got some good curlers in it and the team’s mindset is strong: they don’t have scars from 2012, just youthful positivity.
Moeen Ali evolves in his spiral feeds and Adil Rashid is the striker option, although there is an unknown factor at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped out of England cricket team, to be replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is understandably difficult for me to analyse as I am his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against attackers in challenging conditions, and the simple but stark truth is that cricketers are judged by their scores.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root’s selection prior to the announcement because, as I’ve said before, players are the best choice makers.
About a hundred points more, and Lyth's season on the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own fate.
Hopefully, if he gets more runs in Yorkshire, there'll be another chance.
England coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth’s attitude even when he didn’t perform as well as he could have, and that doesn’t surprise me.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long a batsman gets to leave a mark.
Lyth was selected seven times for the national team, as did Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was selected nine times.
Only Compton got the chance to play both at home and away.
The only complaint is that England first chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean when Lyth was in top shape, but that missed opportunity is now a thing of the past.
Alex Hales is coming with me, and there's a batsman I appreciate.
There’s something about him as a cricketer that we in Yorkshire saw early this season when he scored 236 points against us at Trent Bridge.
You have to give him at least the same chance as the others before him, but of course it depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
There's been a lot of talk about Moeen in the opening pitch next to Cook, which would put an extra pitcher on the pitch, but keep four quick pitches, and I'm not against that.
I don't understand why a batsman couldn't hit there, and this left-handed guy has already proven to be quite the cricketer.
Moeen may not have done his job in his county of Worcestershire, but he is number three to them and there is little difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games with the first grid drop before moving on to the opening in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points and did not remember the past.
Zafar Ansari joins the team as a substitute, and, from what little I’ve been able to do with him, he feels like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his unvarnished stats — hitting an average of 31, with a ball of 35 — and think it’s gambling, but there aren’t too many pitchers available and voters chose the young.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside of the team, England seems to have a few tough additions to the coach side.
Appointing Sri Lankan batsman Mahale Jayawardene as a consultant for the games may turn out to be a stroke of genius.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game and brings with him a huge amount of experience, because he has done everything in every situation and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood joins the white ball games, bringing both energy and a ruthless glimmer.
I’ve always thought that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it’s playing or coaching, and he’s got the kind of brain that can be harnessed.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly’s teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is resting at one-days, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and I certainly have no problem with that.
While not everyone agrees, coaches and selectors don’t make schedules.
And it must be remembered that just like the players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions are never made lightly.
Those in favour of Britain leaving the EU (Brexit) could win if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron’s half-hearted renegotiation strategies to keep Britain in the EU are getting into more and more trouble every day, even without taking into account the hearty Jeremy “Is it yes or no?” of Corbyn’s election as Labour leader or the union confederation’s anger at Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farage.
A European diplomat recently explained that, because the EU is so deeply involved in various crises, not all of which are its own fault, some Member States are fed up with Britain's self-centred agenda of divisive concessions and disruptive treaty changes that these countries, for the most part, do not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the trade union confederation decided that it did not want them either if they eroded social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance are late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without a local eye-catcher, and then come home saying they are winning supporters for reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outside Britain's EU tent - 'Don't leave us alone with France', they say - suggests that the most short-sighted ministers and officials in certain capitals are now at a point where they don't care, we stay then we leave.
Germany’s cautious and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it gets ruined in the same way that happened to Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16) who stayed too long.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande of France faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's a fleeting force, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing government.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrificing themselves for the selfie Brits, when their energy should rather be focused on preventing Scotland from leaving the UK - they do not want that either because of similar separatist tendencies of their own.
So, my friend suggests, some of these ministers may even deliberately plan to make pointless remarks in the Scottish Nationalist Party style during the UK’s 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
"The renegotiations were an arranged affair" and "the renegotiations had no meaning for Britain."
Europeans have had a bitter experience of how greedy the Fleet Street press can be and how EU-sceptic the press monarchs are, which they were not at the time of the 1975 referendum, inspired by Tony Benn, when our membership, which started in 1973, was strengthened by a 2:1 ratio.
They may vaguely recall Boris Johnson, the greatest Euro-opportunist who made a name for himself by writing about 'EU straight bananas' when he was Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a diverse group of tax-guzzling rogues, foreigners hacking phones, and individuals who are nominally resident elsewhere and own most of our major newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought the exact same thing about them, but he realized that if you’re in a cage with a horny gorilla, you have to give up bananas because of the deception, unless you want to be on that gorilla’s lunch list and later on at dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when it came to opposing Cameron’s renegotiation trick, for Bair had agreed to the principle behind the rejected EU Constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgave him.
But nice Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me kindly on the back at Westminster Parliament on Monday (I told him he had no more time to waste on me), seems to be in danger of re-emerging Neil Kinnock's '80s boycott of Murdoch' strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
While it may take time, he is forced to develop a consistent strategy to stay in touch with the media, not me, but undoubtedly Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa Corbyn left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, to put it mildly, developing.
He says he would like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Well, the majority of people outside the UK Independence Party's Ukip war paint craze, as well as the Conservative Party's fiercest nationalists, can certainly stand behind this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not a Benn fan" Benn said so on both radio and TV this week when her inner scout would have wanted to admit that Corbyn's election to appoint tough John McDonnell as shadow government finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his father-in-law was on television trying to be disloyal to his colleagues in the Labour government without going so far as to lose his seat.
Hilary's struggles were more appealing.
But the fight to keep up with "anywhere situation" - as Benn said - was not what McDonnell said, and, by all accounts, what Corbyn told the Heads and Members of Parliament in a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the non-hierarchical, emotional, and personal image that Corbyn wants to convey (remember, he even touched me), communication discipline is important in the age of 24-hour TV, and especially in the turbulent social media landscape that is a breeding ground for paranoia and deception.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to take the Labour Party's support for the referendum campaign for granted.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s basic evasiveness about EU membership (and being in line with their Benn-inspired regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a hard-to-understand discussion among leftist thinkers for whom the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma in doctrinal squabbles.
As for his dichotomy with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby is not campaigning to give up), foreign diplomats just have to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they too have distrustful voters) making concessions to Britain when it could be completely pointless?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed by the poor military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting Conservative government in power, as I was reminded at the start of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts Criticize Public Health England's E-cigarette Review
Researchers have said that the government-funded agency’s claim that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than conventional cigarettes was sparked by a meeting of 12 people, some of whom were linked to the tobacco industry.
The experts, who wrote for the British Medical Journal (BMJ), agreed with Lancet, criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
The PHE published this “marker” report last month, describing it as a “comprehensive review of the evidence.”
However, several researchers have questioned the robustness of the data and cited links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, the medical journal Lancet published an editorial attacking the "exceptionally shaky basis" of the PHE's main conclusion.
Two other researchers who wrote at the BMJ have questioned whether the claims were "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: “The main principle of public health is that policies must be based on proven effectiveness.”
They say the public expects PHE's claim that "the best current estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes" is based on a detailed evaluation and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from one of the 12 people who developed a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) to synthesize their opinions on the harms associated with various nicotine-containing products, and the results of that meeting were summarised in a study.
McKee and Capewell say one of the sponsors of the meeting was the company EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO is said to have previously received funding from Brisish American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also supported the BAT’s public health credentials in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting said they had received funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he was reported to have received from Philip Morris International, they added.
The selection criteria for panel members are not disclosed, but the panel includes several well-known e-cigarette supporters, some of whom also report that they have received funding from the industry.
Others present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE’s tobacco director.
The study, produced by the group, "much eloquently admits" that there is a lack of "indisputable evidence of harm in most products and criteria," McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these links or restrictions are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE’s claims that “there is as yet no evidence that e-cigarettes act as a route to smoking in children or non-smokers” are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, says that the claims made in the BMJ have been answered in the past.
He says, “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
Half of those who burn out die from their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not, especially when there is so much public uncertainty about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related illness, and smoking costs the NHS <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, even though e-cigarettes are not risk-free, their harm is only a fraction of the harm of traditional tobacco - we are fulfilling our national responsibility.
The BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 executive
Former Channel 4 president Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes like EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "give anything" for hits such as this soap opera set on Albert Square.
Johnson said licence fees should only be used to make programmes that are not made by other British broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes, which are likely to have a smaller audience, on difficult transmission times against the most popular programmes of competitors and on channels such as the BBC4.
After BBC President Tony Hall said the company wanted to work more closely with other organisations, Johnson said he had spent six years trying to build a relationship with the BBC.
“I don’t understand the idea that the BBC produces and broadcasts programmes that are clearly suitable for unsubsidised competitors,” Johnson told the House Communications Committee as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC.
If the licence fee is adhered to - and I am not sure it would be a good idea for this media, or in the long term - it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do not make and produce.
The Voice will be broadcast on prime time to gather as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else will show the show is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: “I don’t see why a regressive tax should fund programs that could be funded even without government subsidies.
The Voice is one of a kind and EastEnders the other, undeniably in-house implemented.
To be honest, other channels would give anything for it.
I don't understand how it's about public service broadcasting.
I don’t think it would weaken the BBC at all.”
Johnson, who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC is guilty of crowd-hunting “because of the goals of the people who work there, and because they believe it’s the best way to achieve long-term support.”
He used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC would sell such series as EastEnders, and the BBC's most popular television series, EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's smaller audience public service programmes "go to BBC4 where it is often not possible to measure the number of viewers, but the BBC thereby fulfils its responsibilities and can then hypocritically say in defence of the GBP 4 billion licence fee revenue: 'Of course, we do all these unknown programmes that nobody watches'.
They put them in a broadcast location where no one ever comes to see them.
Johnson told the committee, “I challenge you to find a more regressive system for who gets the most for it.
Of course you all think, we all think that <0xC2><0xA3>150 a year is a lot of value for money, but I don't know if that's true for people for whom <0xC2><0xA3>150 is a lot of money, because they don't use the BBC very much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should re-evaluate its Reith-era mission to "inform, educate and entertain."
He said that only a small part of the BBC's production is now classified as education - he said the figures were 1% for TV production and 0.1% for radio - and that it should follow the example of the Australian and Canadian broadcasters and change the mission to "inform, educate and entertain".
With regard to partnership issues, Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on events such as the Proms concerts, which he said would only be shown on television for a few, and ally itself with commercial companies so that they could all be seen online.
"Sound Genetics" allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction as soon as the sound impulse hits them.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems to control them through sound-wave bursts.
The tiny nematodes change direction as soon as they are hit by a sound impulse that is too high for the human ear to hear.
The impulses work by switching on genetically modified motor neurons with membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves.
Related: Scientists Read and Write Brain Activity with Light
The researchers said that the worms demonstrate the functionality of a new method called sound genetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the method could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that sends electrical impulses to people’s brains to treat Parkinson’s disease.
Nematodes do not normally respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when they are surrounded by a liquid with microscopic bubbles, the situation changed.
He found that the bubbles amplified ultrasonic waves, which then travel inside the worms.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves affect the TRP-4 ion channels, structures found in the cell membranes of some worms.
Sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate attached cells, reports a report in the journal Nature Communications.
In order to produce ultrasonically-guided nematodes, Chalasani genetically engineered the worms so that some of their motor neurons have TRP-4 ion channels.
When Chalasani applied ultrasound to the modified worms, the microbubbles amplified the sound waves and transmitted them to the worms, where they switched on the modified motion neurons.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn nerve cells on and off using light pulses.
However, Chalasani says that there may be some advantages to using sonogenetics over optogenetics.
Unlike light, which must be sent along optical fiber to the desired location inside the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through the tissue unhindered, so they can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that by using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it may be possible to make the targeted human nerve cells momentarily respond to an ultrasound signal in certain neurological treatments in a clinical setting," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Unlawful torture equipment delivered to your home!
This is a shame for the British arms trade.
Watch Amnesty International’s anti-arms fair video.
Terrible killing machines!
Foot-crushing ankle braces!
Cluster bombs!
As well as electronic stun batons that cause painful pain but leave no trace!
The happy voice and imagery of the comics leave no doubt that this ad for the world’s largest arms fair is a sharp parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British Government’s willingness to peddle arms to repressive regimes at a party at the ExCeL Centre in London.

As a result of a separate campaign, many posters appeared on bus stops and metro trains, which required more detailed examination.
"Important information, Will you be travelling on the DLR route from 15 to 18 September?" is asked together using the font and brand of the London Underground, as the DLR track turns into a tank image.
This September, a horde of arms dealers arrive on the DLR route... Customers are asked to help stop the gun show.
The 300 posters were created by artists whose work was exhibited at the Banksy Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A group called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute posters across London using ‘Ad Space Hack Packs’, a <0xC2><0xA3>6 pack of hex keys that, according to the collective, ‘can access one third of the advertising space for bus stops across the planet’.
Transport for London is not amused by this unauthorized "poster vandalism".
One of the parody ads produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, Curator of Cruel Designs and Lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and wanting to take their political work to audiences outside the galleries.
A lot of artists have started working with activists on resistance fronts when they have realized that they have to go to the outside world if they want their art to have an impact on society.
Another anti-arms-trafficking poster greets commuters on the subway.
Amnesty’s video has been viewed more than 100,000 times on Facebook in the last 24 hours and was created for free by the advertising agency VCCP, and the graphic designer and background editor also worked for free.
VCCP’s creative director, Matt Lever, noticed that the gun show was not advertised at all — and there was an empty spot on ExCeL’s calendar at the time — and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They toyed with the idea of a more realistic advertisement for a shady corporation, but "it was more arresting to emphasize the issue with bright colors and animation."
“They have done a fantastic job of helping us to raise questions about illegal torture equipment being sold at trade fairs,” says Tom Davies of Amnesty International.
Now the British Government must take action to ensure that torture equipment is not sold illegally near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art related to arms fairs comes from inside ExCeL, when exhibitors sell fantastically embellished products.
In a press release, Saab revealed that it had received an order from the U.S. Army for a “shoulder-launched AT4CS RS.”
This includes a "unique pipe-battle tip that exerts excellent effects behind the armor inside the target".
Whatever it is doing, it is not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student dormitory
It has been 11 years since I moved to a student dormitory at the age of 19, when I was ignorant, and I still believed in berets and moral relativism, but only now can I remember the forced smiles of the people I irritated - and the numerous, long complaints from others.
Much of what I’ve learned can be summarized in eight simple rules.
Moving into a dormitory can be anything from annoying to completely scary.
It’s tempting to chat: tell where you’re from, did you have a gap year and where, what do you think of Corbyn, and why “I really don’t love or hate Marmite because it’s really just yeast extract HAHAH to find me in my room”.
Take a breath.
And also help others to take a breath - ask questions and show interest.
It will guide the conversation and help you find the people you like, not the ones you wouldn’t want to talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they were sharing fire extinguishers.
Give people some space.
People’s rooms often turn into cocktail parties, movie nights, and common pastimes, but they are also the places where people dress and mend their underwear.
Related: Don’t even think about starting college when you’re in a relationship
College is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a place of rest, but many of the dormitories create a culture of wandering from room to room that is friendly, social, and makes lifelong friends.
It could mean hell for someone trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you permission to say, “I like you and I want to be a friend with you, but I need you to leave now so I can collect back the energy I spent talking to you.”
Try to sense when a fellow student is tired of socializing and maybe text instead of knocking on the door.
When it comes to knocking, knock.
A guy in my dorm room thought that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He's seen a lot of things.
Make friends through baking.
Since you’re starting college at the peak of the baking trend, knocking on people’s doors with a chocolate chip cookie plate and introducing yourself seems a little less weird, less “welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something, now smile when I ask you personal questions” from a 50’s kid.
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obligated to talk, and it may be that in the future they will associate your face with a tasty surprise.
It depends on whether you can cook.
Poorly mixed flour-sugar-fat lumps are likely to make people only pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dorms.
Understandably, taking someone's chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk for your tea?
Ask and check with the owner of the milk.
It is quite possible that they will give you permission, even if they are boiling internally.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you get my sympathy, but try to be more mature than my roommate who mixed detergent in her milk to punish those who stole it.
He's in prison now.
You must not make such noise that people cannot sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that proverbial pot beating on the pot.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could play their drum and bass music more quietly because it was 3:00 a.m. and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally quieted down at five in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep for two hours before making her own music roar, locked her door, and left for the three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dormitory as you?
Or, conversely, wouldn’t it be incredibly embarrassing if you considered your dorm partner your future spouse, teamed up, divorced, and then saw him every day and possibly lost all your mutual friends to him.
Sure, the heart wants what it wants, but if a hot dorm mate is definitely not your future spouse, you could at least try talking some sense into your bottom.
In that exhilarating moment when you realize that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between pranking and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good prank is fun, but it can be canceled in no time.
You can give a useful and fun lesson about safety by hiding something – but never mess up someone’s room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but do not attach their property with a blue sticker to the ceiling more than twice.
Racist attack on accommodation for foreign students in Kitee - A building planned as a reception centre was defaced in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack was carried out on the accommodation of foreign students in Kitee, North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, this is not about accommodation for underage asylum seekers, but about sleeping quarters for foreign students who have been in Finland for a long time,” says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher at the Evangelical Folk High School of Kitee.
The windows and walls of Kansanopisto’s accommodation facilities were smeared with racist signs, such as swastikas, and a metal object had been thrown through the window of one of the accommodation facilities, says the Police of Eastern Finland.
According to Luukkainen, responsible teacher of social guarantee education for young people at Kansanopisto, there were an estimated ten people in the building that was the target of vandalism at the time of the attack.
“It was the weekend and adults are free to move around, so some of them might have been elsewhere,” Luukkainen says.
People from 12 different nationalities are accommodated in the National Institute of Finland.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time as well as newly arrived minors seeking asylum.
Everyone in the messed-up building has A-status.
Some are in basic adult education, some are in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish," Luukkainen says.
A-status is a so-called continuous residence permit that can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
Police in Eastern Finland are investigating the attack as damage and a violation of domestic peace.
According to Luukkainen, a press conference was held for the students on Monday, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There is no panic and no one wants to leave.
We have had foreign students for over a decade, and this is the first time something like this has happened,” Luukkainen says.
He said the messes have been cleaned out of the walls.
At least three men were suspected of having been in a light car.
I think this is the whim of the youth weekend evening, as this topic has now been on the surface.
“Nothing more serious,” he said.
A hospital has also been defaced in Salo, where a reception centre has been planned.
The incident happened last week.
This was reported on MTV’s website on Tuesday.
A swastika was painted on the hospital wall and the words "You are not welcome" were written in English.
A crime has been reported to the police.
Correction of incorrect information given by the police about the age and status of people living in the target building.
The government is shutting down the Y train to Karis, the passengers are upset, "quite idiotic"
The Y-train from Helsinki to Raasepori will stop running in March.
The news angered the passengers who were boarding the train at Helsinki Central Station.
In particular, the shutdown will hit the Suntio people,” said Torbj<0xC3><0xB6>rn Bengtstr<0xC3><0xB6>m, who lives in the municipality.
This is absolutely idiotic, because the number of residents is growing all the time, and those who work need a fast and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be about anything other than political will or lack of it.
Bengtstr<0xC3><0xB6>m says in the HSTV interview video he will come to the capital with a tractor.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H and R trains on the main line will be combined to form the new R line.
The Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppurinna in Tuusula will no longer be used.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on which routes the Ministry will purchase rail traffic for the next contract period.
The contract period changes at the turn of the year and there are routes to be discontinued throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement, to be finalised in the autumn, will later be approved by the Monetary Committee.
Bengtstr<0xC3><0xB6>m, from Siuntio, believes that the government’s train mower is short-sighted.
We make the same mistakes as we have done in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then comes regret.
The Y-train is also used by people other than the people of Raasepori and Siuntio, because it is fast and passes several stations.
Annina P<0xC3><0xB6>yry from Espoo was saddened by the fate of those travelling further away from the city area by train.
“It’s just miserable for those who have to re-plan their journey,” he said as he climbed onto the Y train.
A little relief is promised.
A new train connection will probably be added to the railway line, replacing the Y-train in the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) area, i.e. it will take you all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This creates additional costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for the municipalities in the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now beginning to examine the different options and their impact on the service level and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to estimate the costs accurately.
Rihtniemi says that, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid approximately one million a year for the Y-train, although the Ministry has paid much more than that.
The R line on the main line misses two stations.
In Ainola and Saunakallio, on the other hand, the number of trains will double.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will be closed across the country.
The Ministry will no longer purchase train services on the Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki routes.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route will be shortened to Pieksämäki-Varkaus.
There will be fewer trains on the Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka Harbour and Kajaani-Oulu routes.
Over half a million journeys are made on the routes to be closed down each year, while the total number of journeys purchased by the Ministry is approximately nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring the state annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the book Timeliness of Capital: "It is worth getting acquainted with Marx"
The crises of the world economy have brought to the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work Capital published in 1867-1894, writes Yrj<0xC3><0xB6> Hakanen, known as the former chairman of the SKP, in the book The topicality of Marx’s Capital published today.
"He is being taken more seriously now than he has been for a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx’s assessments of the development of the capitalist economy, of its internationalization and of its increasing penetration into all spheres of life, of the concentration of capital, and of the growing role of money capital and imaginary capital, have proved to be astonishingly far-sighted.
The author list of the book, which is based on the Capital seminars organized by Hakanen, also includes a professor from Aalto University, a respected economist Sixten Korkman.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is topical "now and forever."
Surely the former CEO of the Research Institute of the Finnish Economy and the Delegation of the Finnish Economy is not a Marxist?
No, no, no.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not consider Marx a current economic thinker, but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, the social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and literary connoisseur.
"The usual view is that the history of ideas tells of the wrong opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
It is true that Marx’s predictions went horribly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far-reaching conclusions from the beginning of capitalism.
But Korkman sees value in Marx’s radical attitude.
“What’s more relevant about Marx is that he asked good questions,” he says.
Now we are again discussing Marx’s interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may be able to inspire anyone who wants to understand the big picture, the world that is changing as a result of technological upheaval," Korkman said.
But what the government is supposed to decide tomorrow, Marx does not help.
Capitalism, he said, was a hopeless case that should be stopped.
Still, Marx is worth studying, according to Korkman.
"In the '70s, you couldn't read Marx," Korkman says.
“The Maoists and Trotskyists and other sects all hated capitalism, but they hated each other even more.”
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political baggage of the past.
“Every social scientist should become familiar with Marx’s thinking – as with other classics,” Korkman says.
UN calls for war criminals to be tried in Sri Lanka
The UN is calling for a special tribunal to be set up to investigate war crimes committed during the Sri Lankan civil war.
The United Nations report on the 1983-2009 civil war came out on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both Sri Lankan armed forces and rebels known as Tamil Tigers of war.
It is estimated that at least 100,000 people died in the civil war in Sri Lanka.
The exact number of victims is not known.
In particular, a major military offensive in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, the UN report calls for.
The report accuses the Sri Lankan armed forces of torture, abduction and systematic sexual violence, the victims of which are as likely to be men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have been guilty of forcing bystanders and children into combat.
According to the report, both sides are guilty of murder.
Sri Lanka responded on Wednesday that it would conduct the investigation itself, but would not allow a UN court to be set up because of foreign judges.
The English exam allowed you to weigh up social media
On Wednesday, the autumn matriculation examination had a long foreign language, most of which was English.
More than 16,000 people tested their English skills.
In the experiment, you could write a paper on social media.
Based on our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, a 150-250 word essay in English could be addressed to the editor of the online magazine’s advice column.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is similar to the Finnish Leelia recliner.
He asked for advice on how to get parents to look at things from the point of view of young people as well.
There were four subjects in total, of which one had to be chosen.
"It was the most difficult of them all," says Mia Lybeck, the English lecturer at the Swedish-speaking upper secondary school in Porvoo.
The third topic was just a quote from former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth one was nice, according to Lybeck.
It was supposed to write a speech about why companies should hire young people to work.
“At least in our school, we’ve been practicing writing speeches,” Lybeck says, and rated the entire exam “quite normal.”
In the Finnish - or Swedish - English test, you could answer questions about texts that discussed, for example, the adaptation of summer flounder to climate change and the handling of large masses of data.
Some long Russian (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written on Wednesday.
Writings for the autumn continue on Friday, when it is time for another Finnish or Swedish test.
In upper secondary schools, the exam is held normally, which means that it is not affected by the employees’ demonstration.
The Matriculation Examination Board urges the candidates to find suitable transport connections in time so that they can get to the test event.
You may also be granted additional time if you can prove that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
A store in Oulu was robbed at gunpoint
On Wednesday morning, a shop was robbed in the Kello district of Oulu.
According to police, the robber was dressed in dark clothes and a commando hat covering his face.
The man is normal-bodied and about 30 years old.
Police said the man had threatened staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money.
This is being investigated as a robbery.
Police prepare for tens of thousands of demonstrators arriving in Helsinki - support patrols from elsewhere in Finland
A protest against the government’s cuts will block the centre of Helsinki on Friday, police predicts.
According to preliminary information, tens of thousands of people may arrive.
Members of the SAK, Akava and STTK unions meet at the Railway Square at 11 a.m.
Police are also expected to take part in the demonstration.
The task of the police at work, in turn, is not only to carry out alarm tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure the success of the giant demonstration.
Roads leading to the Railway Square will be closed to motor vehicles from 9.30 am to 2 pm.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed into the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off at the Kaisaniemi roundabout, from the west starting from Mannerheimintie.
Will the Helsinki Police Department have enough people, Chief Inspector Seppo Kujala?
So far, at least, it seems that enough is enough.
I have no opinion on police work.
According to Kujala, support patrols from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki as a result of the demonstration.
The police won't tell us who the real Scouts are.
“There will be some coming, but we can usually manage on our own,” Kujala says.
Police are urging residents to avoid driving in central Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic jam extends from the Hakaniemi level to the city centre.
Standstill traffic is expected from the morning until early evening.
With the arrival of protestors from other parts of Finland, there will also be a lot of charter buses coming to Helsinki.
They're not allowed at the railway station.
Buses are usually very far away.
The rest of the way is then to walk to the protest site,” Kujala says.
The demonstration will also stop public transport in Helsinki.
From a police point of view, there is a positive side.
The issue of the fluency of public transport, which is normally at hand in these large gatherings of people, will now be dealt with in part by itself.
The organisers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government’s economic policy may come to Helsinki.
Police expect the demonstration to proceed calmly.
The people are ordinary working people or the unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Finns are reasonable and peaceful people,” Kujala says.
Local demonstrations will also be held in different parts of Finland on Friday.
Friday's demonstration is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is not a very good point of comparison in Finnish political history,” says Professor Emeritus Martti Siisäinen from the University of Jyväskylä.
It is no wonder that the trade union movement is protesting.
If it did not, it would raise its hands in front of the government,” Siisäinen says.
A very right-wing government has struck at the core of the Finnish corporatist tradition – and also at points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government’s harsh approach to contract law is lacking.
There are a lot of signs that the trade union movement is really trying to get down on its knees.
At the same time, the Y movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
The mirror is needed, for example, because the trade union movement does not have the support of all wage-earners for Friday’s demonstrations.
What is new now is the sharp division that the demonstration will create in the crowd that the trade union movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
Unemployed people from all over Finland demonstrated at the Parliament House in November 1993.
If we are looking for a point of comparison for Friday’s demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration for the unemployed, Murrostorstai, organised in 1993, says Siisäinen.
In the midst of the deepest depression, Murrostorstai gathered together 20,000 unemployed people.
Esko Aho’s (central) government stumbled from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relations between the Finnish Government and the workers’ organisations had never been so bad as under the bourgeois government of Aho.
Now the relationship between the government and the trade union movement is perhaps even worse than it was in the days of Murros Thursday.
Besides, Finland’s most powerful bourgeois government ever is now in power,” Siisäinen says.
The current government coalition is still interesting in such a way that it is so strictly right-wing despite the speeches of the True Finns.
There were still some elements of the old labor movement.
Thousands of protesters are expected to attend on Friday.
The demonstration will also stop public transport and possibly close kindergartens and schools.
While the demonstration does not receive the undivided support of wage earners, it can become the largest in years.
In recent years, about 300 demonstrations have been held in Helsinki each year.
They're all over the place.
Traditionally, Finnish trade union demonstrations have been quite peaceful - even though the ways of working have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, Finnish demonstrations avoid conflict and are law-abiding.
Protesters try to avoid damaging or destroying property, says Siisinen.
However, the late 1990s brought a new wind.
The demonstration culture changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous about throwing eggs, and the police were prepared to get pig shit on them.
The firefighters’ strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also striking strikes by pilots and air traffic controllers, for example.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electric strikes of the 1970s
The most significant strikes of the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metal workers took part in the strike.
The strike was suspended by a motion of the conciliation committee after seven weeks.
Metal workers received a 16 percent pay rise.
The electric strike in the spring of 1977 lasted 49 days and caused power outages across the country.
Murrostorstai in 1993
On 4 November 1993, around 20,000 people, many made unemployed by the recession, gathered in front of the Parliament House to demonstrate in favour of work.
Firefighters went on strike for three months in 1998
The firefighters’ strike was one of the longest, if not the longest, nationwide strikes of the 1990s.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
In 1994, when farmers protested against the EU, the police were caught in the rain of eggs.
"Siberia teaches, Europe stops" was one of the slogans.
In Spain, farmers shed tons of snow.
The 1999 EU summit in Helsinki also caused farmers to protest and burn hay bales in front of the meeting place.
The nurses went on strike in 1983 and 1995.
Nurses went on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they went on strike was in 1983.
The strike of 1995 was marked by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened a strike and mass dismissals of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass resignation finally accelerated the negotiations to a conclusion.
The doctors went on strike in 2001
"Doctors on strike - by necessity" was the slogan of the striking doctors in 2001.
The strike of municipal health centre and hospital doctors lasted for five months and sparked a lively debate on how the strikes could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the salaries of doctors.
Students on the move in 2013
Around 5,000 students marched in support of student financial aid from Senate Square to the Parliament House in Helsinki in 2013.
Central Criminal Police investigates background of Finnish truck full of refugees to Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police for help in investigating the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped a truck carrying 42 refugees near the German border in Aisterheim.
It is not known if the truck was on its way to Finland.
Everyone on board was in good shape.
We've been exchanging information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility will be at the scene in Austria, says Chief Superintendent Tero Haapala of the Finnish Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, the fate of the other refugees who had travelled in a lorry in Austria was worse.
All 71 passengers on board died of asphyxiation.
According to Yleisradio, which first reported on cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited liability company.
Among other things, the company operates restaurant operations and its CEO is a man of foreign background, who is about 40 years old.
Two Iraqi men have been arrested in Austria for human trafficking.
A refugee-beating captain, former drug courier and wealthy businessman - the story of five smugglers
A wealthy king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a style-conscious missionary, and a taxi driver who thinks he's a good guy.
Such people, for example, are involved in smuggling human beings into the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, a criminologist at the University of Trento, and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and their book Death Travel Agency will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the tentacles of human smuggling, suggest solutions and introduce smugglers from different stages of the business.
HS presents five of them.
I'll beat them right out of you.
The Kerkenna islands on Tunisia's east coast do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there to spend the summer.
Due to its location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 kilometres away.
For comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a chain-smoking captain and father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimp, but it is more profitable for the fisherman to transport people.
This is what Emir has done hundreds of times with his blue, ten-metre wooden boat.
If the boat is full, it can hold up to 40 people.
For one trip, Emir earns about 8,000 euros after expenses.
Emir has five assistants looking for clients all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis flared up again.
Guests arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
The Emir will house them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
The food is given so that the customers barely survive.
Accommodation costs around 75 euros per night, and if a customer runs out of money in the middle, that’s their problem.
We set sail at midnight in extinguished lanterns.
The first night you drive off the islands, then stop, wait a day and drive to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes the sea is rough, and in waves 20 meters high, passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, the human cargo is unloaded in half an hour and the Emir is on his way back.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats up his customers and at least claims to beat the fuckers to death.
He says in the book that when the police spotted him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
“I grabbed customers one by one by the neck and threw them overboard,” Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of the Sahara.
He said his countrymen would have to beat him up over this.
I'll beat the crap out of them right now.
We need to show them right now who's in charge here.
Just an ordinary taxi driver.
Goran is a regular taxi driver in Bogova<0xC5><0xA1>a, Serbia.
His taxi is not very good - the starter engine is running at its last and it has seen its best days anyway.
However, the most important thing for Goran’s customers is that the taxi is moving at all, and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogova<0xC5><0xA1>a is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village there is a centre for asylum seekers, which is mainly open to families.
In the forests surrounding the city centre, men travelling without their families stay in tents, lean-tos and abandoned cars, which everyone has now managed to find or build.
There are also families living in the forest who, for one reason or another, have not submitted an application for asylum in Serbia.
Some also stay in private apartments, but that’s a public secret.
Among the hunters, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of border crossings and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When they finally arrive in the Bogova<0xC3><0xB0>a area, a major human smuggling hub, people are exhausted.
Goran's passengers are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are the Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say it once, and that's enough," Goran says.
He says the Africans are trying to make a deal.
Goran doesn't like that.
All the way, all the way, all the way.
First you agree on a price of, say, EUR 300, then they lower it to EUR 200, and finally they offer EUR 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I'm not interested in money.
I just do my job and help people,” he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than others and only charges 50 euros per person for a ride to the Hungarian border.
It's about 200 miles, most of it on the highway.
I hear colleagues are asking for three or four times the price.
Goran earns about 50,000 euros a year.
It is not a large sum for a smuggler, but in Serbia it is quite a comfortable annual income.
Serbia has banned taxis from transporting migrants within 12 kilometres of the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn’t care: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his passengers a mile from the border.
Then he points his customers in the right direction and hurries them away.
Compassion in the Work
The 35-year-old Congolaism is called the Missionary, and it is not just a nickname.
Indeed, he has a Protestant church in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, which is frequented by many Congolese refugees, and a small centre to help Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Missionary is running a smuggling business that transports people from the Congo to Europe.
He sees himself as doing the work of mercy.
It's important for a missionary to look good.
She polishes her shoes several times a day and makes sure that the rubber band on her white underpants peeks elegantly under the low waist of the jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his SUV and his three motorcycles.
When the Missionary is not preaching, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and on to Europe.
Initially, the customer will call one of the five telephone numbers of the Missionary.
He advises you to arrive at the border in the morning, hide your money carefully, and slip into the crowd of traders crossing the border.
In order to obtain the status of asylum seeker or refugee, the Ugandan authorities must be informed that they come from war zones in North Kivu, for example, and that they have been forced to flee their homes due to violence.
Often this is true, but if it is not, the Missionary arranges a new identity for the client.
Your old ID will be destroyed and replaced with a new one.
That's where the Missionary's contacts with the Ugandan police help.
After that, the client is directed to the same place where even real asylum seekers go: to the asylum procedure, to NGOs, and finally to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).
The missionary knows the bureaucracy, because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges for each step separately: filing an application with the Ugandan police costs around EUR 100, handling documents for a humanitarian organisation around EUR 150 and moving to a European country, for example, EUR 4 500 to EUR 7 000.
Foil and ice cubes
Tom is a novice smuggler, a former drug courier.
A 40-year-old Irishman is on duty off the coast of France, in Calais, where his job is to load people on trucks en route to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan, French taxi driver who lives in London, and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they are in the human smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver pick up their customers, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near the center of Calais.
They're driving down the A26 and trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would go straight to jail for organizing illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been in prison for seven years for drugs.
When the taxi stops, Tom and his customers run across the highway to a rest stop where the drivers sleep before continuing across the Channel to the United Kingdom.
Tom picks the right truck, makes sure it's on its way to England, not Holland, for instance, and cuts through the tarpaulin's safety wire.
We have to do it quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved in the plot, but then the action is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his customers in aluminum foil, similar to the one they wrap around a roast or baked potato in the kitchen.
That should keep the police thermal scanner from noticing who's hiding.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in a truck and leaves, hoping that the driver won’t suddenly steal passengers, at least not before Britain.
The King of Smugglers
Muammer K<0xC3><0xBC><0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xBC>k is one of the world’s most famous smugglers.
Upporika has been called a master of marketing and the undisputed king of illegal Mediterranean landings, who controls sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
K<0xC3><0xBC><0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xBC>k has been operating since the 1990s and constantly developing new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he demands the money only when he gets there.
One of the new methods is the luxury ship scam: yachts are rented out from Turkish ports to take American or European families on a pleasant few days of tourist cruises.
In reality, the ships are being loaded full of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who, for a fee of EUR 5 000 to 7 000, are being transported first from Istanbul by land to a port and then by sea to Europe.
Customers are stored in human warehouses, for example in old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People get crammed into minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and wait for the sign.
When it is given, you need to get on board quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden under the deck for the entire journey.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship is swimming, as no other signs of the crowd are visible.
Food and drink are provided, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
K<0xC3><0xBC><0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xBC>k will receive around €53,000 for one luxury ferry trip after expenses.
He does not deal with practical matters himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, hosts and other lesser agents to do the work for him.
During the summer season, there are at least hundreds of transports and K<0xC3><0xBC><0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xBC>k makes millions.
He is believed to have bought land through front companies, a pharmaceutical company, and more than a hundred apartments he rents.
In 2011, Muammer K<0xC3><0xBC><0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xBC>k was arrested at the same time as a member of parliament from the Turkish Democratic Party and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, he seems to have disappeared.

American Olympic runner talks about her illness and becoming a prostitute
Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 1,500-meter runner who has competed three times in the Olympics, has written a new book that has attracted attention in the United States.
In her book Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton talks about ending her career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated published excerpts from the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the race in top condition and ran in the qualifiers for the second best time.
In the final, however, he panicked.
From the very beginning, he rushed to the top and defended his leading position with a manic run.
150 meters before the finish, however, his strength ran out.
He collapsed on the track and was overtaken by other competitors, one after the other.
I felt like an idiot and thought I would never run again.
But I forced myself over the finish line, says Favor Hamilton in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton was suffering from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself was under tremendous pressure for success.
Favorite Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting paid to have sex with strangers.
She also persuaded her husband to accept her actions.
The fare for Favor Hamilton was 450 euros per hour.
He said he spent the money on luxury.
Another explanation given by Favor Hamilton for becoming a prostitute was that he missed the same adrenaline rush he had when competing in athletics.
It was later revealed to Favor Hamilton that he suffered from bipolar disorder.
The former star runner’s double life came to light in late 2012 when the magazine Smoking Gun published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000 he was world No. 1 in the 1500 metres with a time of 3.57.40, but finished last in the Sydney Olympic final.
The World Champion was delighted when the union put the Norwegian ski-cock under control: "Straightbacked"
Norway’s skiing king, Petter Northug, has crossed the boundaries of fitness in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Association have been wresting all summer and autumn for an athlete’s contract, as they did last year.
Although the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been enough for a multiple world champion and Olympic champion.
The Norwegian Ski Association decided to exclude Northug from the next season's World Cup.
The decision was praised by two-time world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad the union put the ski-cock in check.
“Thank you for pointing out the spine,” Jacobsen wrote on Facebook.
“We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for a union sponsor,” he said.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Association and Northug is about money.
Northug apparently wants to be on the national team for part of the season so he can promote his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent a federation that also looks after future generations and won’t let one athlete off the hook.
At the same time, he recalled that the union had given Northug both financial and other privileges for several years.
I know this because I’ve been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has a completely different set of rules than just because he is the best.
Northug released his own statement on Tuesday, saying he wanted to play in Norwegian colours next season in the World Cup, as well as at the World Cup and the Olympics afterwards.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Cups, including two gold medals.
He was on the team that won the relay gold in Falun last winter.
The Day of the Frying Compilers is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On the race day on 25 September, there will be events in different restaurants and stores that have been awarded the Frying Trappers’ Shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland’s high-level expertise in the food sector and to lower the threshold for going to a restaurant, as well as to raise awareness of the importance of the plate as a part of high quality.
At the same time, we want to remind you that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the Helsinki metropolitan area, but there are top restaurants all over Finland that have been inspected and classified by an independent operator.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of the restaurants and the organisation.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is organised in Vaasa in restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, the Old Town restaurant participates in the race day.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has been decided to make the event one of the most significant international events of the organisation, which will be held on the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland will remain the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki-lehti: Complaint to the Chancellor of Justice about the establishment of Kauhava reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are co-operating to establish a refugee reception centre at the Kauhava ex-garrison facilities currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the critical infrastructure of the crisis period is still permanently located in the area, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, Suomen Erillisverkot Oy.
According to Kauhajoki magazine, a private individual’s view is that the location of a reception centre in the same building complex would pose a significant security risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interests related to the area and airport of the former Air Force Academy, the impact of which has also not been investigated in the preparation of the reception centre.
The case states that for the past two years, negotiations have been held on the organisation of flight training and the arrival of a potential foreign operator at Kauhava Airport.
The matter has been discussed with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinist<0xC3><0xB6> and Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Defence Arto Räty, among others.
The private individual informs the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not against the reception centre in principle, but that the planned location in the former garrison area is incorrect.
The City Board of Kauhava discussed the reception centre issue last Monday.
The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Governance means that immigrants and those present here have the necessary conditions,” Niinist<0xC3><0xB6> commented to journalists in the evening after meeting the chairmen of all parliamentary parties at his official residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, the concern about managing the refugee situation was common to all participants.
He considers it valuable that the government and opposition parties in Finland are able to discuss fundamental issues in confidence.
Especially in these times when we are facing great challenges
According to Niinist<0xC3><0xB6>, the situation in Syria and the actions of Russia and the United States in the region may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, in the Baltic Sea region.
He is optimistic about the development of the dialogue.
If the situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. if the United States and Russia are able to do so, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and further on the tension in the Baltic Sea.
The issue of NATO was also discussed.
The president did not comment on the job market.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, closes for a couple of hours
One flight will be cancelled on Thursday and 15 on Friday.
The list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair’s website.
Finavia is told that the operations of the airports will be managed by supervisors during a work stoppage.
Congestion and delays are expected, however, at security checks and other service points.
Demonstration closes streets of Helsinki city centre
The demonstration on Friday will close the streets of Helsinki city centre.
Police say the streets leading to the railway station square will be closed to cars from 9:30 to 14:00.
From Mannerheimintie, no cars are allowed to enter Kaivokatu, Postikatu or T<0xC3><0xB6><0xC3><0xB6>l<0xC3><0xB6>nlahdenkatu towards the railway station.
From Unioninkatu in the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is directed to Unioninkatu at the Kaisaniemi roundabout.
According to police, the closing time depends on the number of people participating in the demonstration.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed into the area.
Metro and tram drivers at the rally on Friday
Metro and tram drivers will take part in Friday’s demonstration from the beginning of morning traffic to the end of night traffic.
The Association of Tram and Metro Staff informed STT about this in the evening.
The majority of Alko will be closed for two hours, even with the post office closed.
Friday’s demonstration will also cause disruptions to Posti’s services.
Significant delays are expected, for example, in the delivery of day mail.
Most of the post offices are closed.
The Finnish Red Cross’s blood deliveries are handled despite the strike.
Meal deliveries, hospital deliveries and laboratory samples will also be handled.
Information about the services is available on Posti’s website.
The majority of Alko in Finland will close its doors for two hours on Friday.
The services union Pam has instructed its employees to stop work between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.
Pam has also called on grocery trade workers to take part in a trade union protest.
The representatives of SOK and Kesko tell Helsingin Sanomat that they will try to keep the stores open with the help of supervisors if necessary.
According to Kesko, there is no information yet on the possible closing of individual stores.
Partial closure of Helsinki day-care centres
Helsinki’s day care centres will not operate to their full extent on Friday, the Helsinki Early Childhood Education and Care Agency reports.
Due to the protests of trade unions, day care may be concentrated in certain day-care centres, and day-care centres and playgrounds will not be organised.
24-hour day care centres and groups for children with intellectual disabilities and children with multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, afternoon activities for schoolchildren with intellectual disabilities and autistic children are organised normally.
The National Board of Education will announce the changes tomorrow.
Media Researcher: Sipilä is taking a big risk
According to Sipilä, versatile channels are needed in communications, and the Prime Minister’s television and radio speeches are one channel among others.
We will also need this kind of direct-talk channel in the future.
This will not be the last time,” Sipilä told reporters in Parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister’s television and radio speeches will become a recurring habit.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be broadcast on Yle’s channels in the future.
If there are other channels, we’ll see.
We’re going to use this channel tonight,” he said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires television and radio speeches to be given to citizens.
The issue we are talking about here is rather complex and requires a longer justification.
That’s why we ended up on this channel,” Sipilä explained.
The speech will be broadcast from 21.05-21.20 on both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also see it in the arena.
Your pet is taking a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä’s televised speech will not tell about the government’s more general turning inward.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define public debate more firmly into one’s own hands and to refuse to discuss the issues in public debate?” says Professor Anu Koivunen from Stockholm University.
It reminds me of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Timo) Soini’s recent comment that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define itself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these issues are unrelated.
Koivunen understands that the commercial media is outraged by Sipilä’s announcement.
It would be strange if the media didn't react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not reporting issues in a democracy.
It is, by definition, the task of the representatives of the media to try to avoid taking politicians’ agendas for granted.
According to Koivunen, television talk is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech.
Is there more to what we have already heard?
Or is he able to speak in a different tone, in a different way, or in different words, or to say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old thing, one must wonder why such a big gesture was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
You also take a risk in this case, if it is not a special situation but a routine speech among others.
There is a risk that Yle will be branded as a media outlet for politicians or the Parliament and the Government, which is certainly not in Yle’s interests or general policy.
Sly bet from Sipilä
In Sipilä’s upcoming speech, it is also important what the Prime Minister does not say, media researcher emphasises.
In the evening, we should take a good look at what Sipilä is missing and what is not,” says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to Kuutt, the TV speech is a clever move for Sipilä, because this way he can express his own views without gravel noises.
In this way, the message can be received by the general public without a journalistic filter, as opposed to a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
He bypasses the media and speaks directly to the people.
There is, however, a risk that the media will misinterpret something of the speech, as it will not be possible to ask more specific questions.
According to Kuuti, it is very important how Sipilä appears on TV - does sweat run down, do hands tremble.
He compares Sipilä to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If you can make it look good, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government were to inform about something, because here it is as if a person is talking directly to another person.
This is what President Barack Obama and his associates do on a regular basis.
Truly exceptional
Political scientist Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister’s speech to citizens to be truly exceptional.
It has not happened in decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Extraordinary times require extraordinary means,” Railo says.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister wants the Finns to be sympathetic to the blackmails that lie ahead.
Workers’ organisations will organise demonstrations and strikes against the government’s actions on Friday.
Chairman of the Left Alliance Paavo Arhinmäki says on Twitter that Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow discussion of the speech.
Antti Rinne, Chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Finland (SDP), announces that he will challenge Sipilä to dialogue.
This is no time for monologues.
Six months from the election.
You can’t hide forever,” Rinne wrote on Twitter.

Finnish UFC star disappointed in young people’s violent fad: You will cause hatred
Kurdish MMA fighter Makwan Amirkhani posted a video on Facebook that particularly appeals to young people with an immigrant background.
Makwan Amirkhani gave a powerful speech against street fighting among young people.
Amirkhani, who was born in Iran and came to Finland with his family at the age of five, has so far won both his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC MMA series.
Amirkhani said he received a message asking him to look at an Instagram account.
Videos of young people fighting with extreme violence have been uploaded to the account.
Amirkhani says he is disappointed by the young people’s fad.
Amirkhan, 26, has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys are kicking people on the ground, sitting on top of each other, and hitting them blindly without even thinking about the consequences of what happens when you make videos like this.
Difficult to defend anymore
Some of the young people shown in the videos have an immigrant background.
According to Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinonen, fighting videos have been uploaded to social media by both immigrants and young Finns.
Especially when you're fighting on the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland,” says Amirkhani from Turku.
Amirkhani points out that there are sites in Finland that are looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
There have been a great many of these individual cases.
It's a little hard, boys, to justify you any longer.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be guests here for quite some time.
That’s a slightly different way of saying thank you for being here,” Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever fall victim to racism, you will be the ones to blame.
Think about it a couple of times before you get into that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent actions contribute to racism.
You make me hate people that I don't even like.
You've got things pretty bad anyway, and you're not going to improve them at all, Amirkhani decides.
SAK pledges its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
The chairman of SAK, Lauri Lyly, says on Twitter that on Monday the employees’ organisation will reflect on its position on the alternative savings list presented by STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK’s proposal on Twitter.
Earlier on Wednesday, the Confederation of Finnish Employees (STTK) said it would present its own proposal to the government to achieve the five per cent productivity leap demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party).
Sture Fjäder, Chairman of Akava, believes that the Board of Directors will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
It would, however, require the largest employee organisation, SAK, to soften its previous position.
The president of SAK, Lauri Lyly, on the other hand, commented sparingly on the matter on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK bureau will discuss the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock", and that instead of compulsory laws, agreements between active parties are needed.
Lyly points out that Prime Minister Sipilä’s government’s proposal for a social contract was not acceptable to SAK.
Previously, Sipilä broke off negotiations on a social contract when SAK refused to commit to the target of a five per cent productivity leap.
Comment: A large demonstration threatens to collapse - "It feels a bit funny to shake a fist"
After all, it feels a bit funny to shake a fist if there is already an atoning paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The atmosphere in the employee camp varies widely.
Do you want to overthrow the government or do you want to agree with it?
On Monday, the federal leaders of the SAK expressed their holy hatred towards the Government of the Republic.
The whole country was threatened with closure.
The threat spread to the Akavas.
The teachers’ union OAJ threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no school or kindergarten will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), chairman of STTK, the central organisation for officials, performed conciliatoryly.
He said that he had kept in touch with the government and was preparing an alternative proposal, which Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party) demanded, for a leap of five per cent in productivity.
The chairman of Akava, Sture Fjäder (kok), was quick to announce that his contract was ready.
At first, there was no sound from the SAK office.
Chairman Lauri Lyly (sd) is having a hard time coming to an agreement when federal leaders just on Monday ordered the country to stand up on Friday.
In the end, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that the SAK was looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order for the joint proposal of the employees to emerge, SAK should be inclined to accept the target of a productivity leap of five per cent.
It is no wonder that the STTK in Palola has good relations with the Sipilä government.
Palola’s right-hand man, Jukka Ihanus, STTK’s Director of Social Impact, previously worked as a special assistant to the Prime Ministers Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
Palola said that the government’s trade union competence has been improving all the time.
Coincidence or not, Palola’s exit took a bit of energy away from the Finnish stagnationists, whose figurehead is AKT’s Marko Piirainen (sd).
It feels a bit funny to shake a fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket.
Edited at 6:00 p.m.: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
Chairman of the Russian State Duma Sergei Naryshkin criticized the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
Russian Duma spokesman Sergei Naryshkin said that Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
In the Mongolian capital, Ulan Bator, the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun, where Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the jubilee meeting in Helsinki in July.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who were on the European Union's sanctions list to come to the meeting - an issue that the President often reminded journalists of.
According to our assessment, this was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed, according to the Interfax news agency.
Naryshkin’s criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU, but also at the United States, where he was also barred from entering.
“Sanctions are political suicide from the EU,” Naryshkin said.
The Russian delegation got to Mongolia without any complications, so Naryshkin continued to scold Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for its "excellent organisation".
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting that took place in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue should have no obstacles.
In Ulaanbaatar, Naryshkin has met with Ilkka Kanerva (kok), the leader of the meeting, who, according to Russian media, has already discussed with the Russian delegation.
The lock meets the real playoff troll: "Goals tight"
Today, Tappara and Lukko continue their bull days in Hakametsä, when both are on fire for the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that there will be no actual goal celebrations in Hakametsä today.
Yesterday Tappara went to Kuopio to drill a 3-2 overtime win against KalPa.
The rise was manly, as last season’s silver team was at its worst from a two-goal loss position.
Tuesday night was more chilly.
The Blues’s catch was round zero points, and the loss figures were also 2-3.
Tough game, goals in tight, if any, play a similar game as last year, Lukko forward Janne Lahti predicts setups on the club’s website.
The killer has become quite a playoff nightmare for the Rauma people.
In the last two seasons, Tappara has dropped in the semifinals from the final series.
On both occasions, a decisive seventh match has been called for.
Last season, Lukko put the series on hold in the fourth game, but Tappara rose to the front and passed in the next three games.
With the exception of goalkeepers, there are no major changes in the composition of the teams.
Both of the boxes that were rejected yesterday will have a turn for the flute today.
With Tappara goal Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhunen, and between the Lukko poles Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Point of view: Bad play in <0xC3><0x84>ssä
Sports director Toivola wrote an unsuitable sequel for head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote the screenplay for Rocky, in which he played the leading role.
The underdog sensationally challenged heavyweight world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a lot of sympathy, even though he eventually lost the title fight.
Thirty years after Rocky’s premiere, Mika Toivola wrote a troubled Cinderella story in Pori.
The nameless and wooden-handed cauldron-pakka progressed to the Finnish Championship finals in 2006 to everyone’s surprise.
The team was full of anonymous but tenacious underdogs like Rocky.
There was a White Indian, Mattia from Pori and Pele from Pelto.
In the playoffs, the players dyed their heads red and cut off the Iroquois.
She turned blonde.
The great TV commentator JP Jalo called the coach Neumann.
The Aces took the silver.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
Writer Toivola believes that this season’s novel will work in the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man who works as the sports director of the <0xC3><0x84>ssäs has built a baton on bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been beating guys in the trough like Rocky pig carcasses at a slaughterhouse.
The merits of Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen lie in something other than discus gaming.
Toivola has forgotten that Pekka Rautakallio plays the main role in Rocky VI.
Karri Kivi has named the Iron Cliff Sean Connery.
In Rocky, written by Toivola, Rautakallio is as clumsy as Connery would have been in the 1976 original.
There's no Rocky on the Iron Cliff other than the nickname.
Rautakallio’s game philosophy does not include rushing and running.
He appreciates the hard play, but it's one thing to play hard as a pig.
Last season, <0xC3><0x84>ssien Garret Stafford tackled Tappara from Jere Karjala to his head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Rautakallio put the man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play for those who deserve it.
I don’t approve of such a game and it doesn’t belong in ace hockey, the hot-tempered Iron Cliff snapped after the game at the People of Satakunta.
This season’s team has been strangely built.
There's kids, there's veterans, there's cops, there's boosters.
There are virtually no key players in the prime of the game.
No wonder the head coach has complained of a lack of skill.
How much have you been able to influence player acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
Last season’s events have an impact on purchases and unfortunately the situation on the market was quite limited,” Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
There's smouldering under the surface.
Year 1953 Rautakallio is reportedly interested in becoming the sports boss of Toivola.
The men's contracts expire in the spring.
The balance of <0xC3><0x84>ssät in the three league matches of the season is equal number of losses with goal difference 1-6.
Toivola shouldn't have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen as Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuukka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under the direction of her husband.
Yes, I play the mother of my husband’s friend in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, actress and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
She has been married to Tuukka Temonen, Apulanta’s former bassist and director, since 2008.
The couple have worked together a lot before, but this is the first time that Olga has acted under Tuukka’s direction.
The role of Olga in the film You Made Us Beautiful is Sirkka, the mother of drummer Sipe Santapuk.
The cricket encourages and supports his son, although his father, Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann), tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I get to know my real role model Sirkka, the easier it seems to play the role.
He’s a great guy and I’m grateful to Tuukka for trusting me with the role.
Olga had already met Sirkka before the film project, but since then the two have become much closer.
They've met, talked on the phone, and texted.
The cricket has helped me a lot.
We've gone through a lot of different angles in their history.
Luckily, Sirkka also understands that drama is drama and the truth may need to be colored a bit.
Olga emphasizes that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanta would become the biggest band in Finland.
The '90s were a recession, and it was really bleak.
There was a small chance that someone would actually succeed, but Sirkka had some intuition, and she was right.
Olga says that she had heard a lot about Tuukka’s youth even before the film plans.
Sometimes the stories of my parents are a little different.
Yes, if you are a 15-year-old teenager, then how much do parents really know what you were up to?
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from that of Touka, who is known as Heinola’s notorious skateboarder.
Olga was an everyday and kind girl who would not have had anything to do with the movie Tuukka.
At most, he could have secretly fallen in love.
According to Olga, she has worked so much with Tuukka over the past 10 years that she is not afraid of a big joint project.
Everything has always gone super well.
Now the entire production team is going to Heinola for a month.
However, the couple living in Iitti will often drive home at night because of their small children, as the distance is not too long.
We'll take over Heinola for a month.
They have received us very warmly, only asking which streets and when to clear.
Iron Sky 2 Becomes Finland's Most Expensive Drama Film
Timo Vuorensola’s Iron Sky: The Coming Race has a budget of 17 million euros.
Filming will begin in Belgium in October.
Director Timo Vuorensola will start shooting Iron Sky 2 in Belgium in October.
The sequel to the sci-fi film Iron Sky: The Coming Race will become the most expensive drama film ever made in Finland with a budget of 17 million euros.
Previously, the title of Finland’s most expensive film has been Jalmari Helander’s Big Game.
The upcoming Angry Birds animation will also surpass Iron Sky 2 with a budget of more than 100 million euros.
The film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa, will be filmed at AED Studios near Antwerp in October and will last for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola will leave for Belgium next week.
The big budget doesn’t scare me.
I've been so relaxed!
I have such a relaxed feeling about the script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone in the team seems to realize that we are doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there is no fear in your ass.
I’m more excited and can’t wait to show this movie to the audience,” he told Iltalehti.
The original budget of the film was expected to be 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but it's a big story.
However, you could get 100 million in the movie, because every angle and effect is so expensive.
Now everything is twisted so tight that there is no slack at all.
The film’s production company, Iron Sky Universe, launched a crowdfunding campaign and a bond on Wednesday at an annual interest rate of 4-8 percent.
The final interest rate will be determined by supply and demand during the campaign.
Within two years, the company will repay the loan.
The film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junti or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
The fronts of the Trendsetters have been decorated with big logos lately.
Until recently, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs ever did.
Advertising the brand of a hoodie or a t-shirt was seen as a bit of a dump.
But times change.
Sportiness has become a real fashion megatrend, and so have the old, familiar sports fashion brands such as Adidas and Nike.
And as so often before, the line between funny and trendy is blurred: if something is already a real jerk, it starts to turn ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. the mundane fashion, in which the trend setters surprised me by preferring basic clothes that were as boring as possible as a way to stand out from the crowd.
Now instead of the grey basic sweatshirt, we put on the sweatshirt buried in the bottom of the closet, with the manufacturer’s logo in front of it.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, the recognisable Adidas tracksuits, favorite team jerseys and New York Yankees caps have also made a comeback in streetwear.
The Calvin Klein logos on the underpants are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be shifting from sports brands to luxury brands.
For example, Versace’s autumn blouse chest makes it clear what brand of garment it is.
Would you be willing to show logos in your dress?
The Russian politician published proof: I did not get stuck for hours in the tank hatch!
The incident allegedly took place in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held.
In recent days, Russian media have been spreading colorful allegations that the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations had to remove Zotov from the large tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since made every effort to deny the information.
He even posted a picture on his own public Facebook page, in which he seems to be peeking through the hatch of an armored vehicle in a very good mood and, at least according to the pictures, it is not about getting stuck or getting angry.
It's complete nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I did not enter the battle tank, but it was an assault tank BMP-3.
I myself am a former soldier, Lieutenant Colonel, I have served in the Urals.
I went inside, looked around and came out in peace," Zotov told Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I didn’t get stuck, and I certainly didn’t spend five hours in that position,” he said.
Zotov told the Russian Army TV channel that he admired Russia’s new technology at the show because he was a former professional soldier.
That’s why I was interested in what’s inside the car, I admired our technology.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And in the next show I will definitely go to all tanks and all tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the reporter an idiot.
One idiot wrote and everyone else did.
There was no such thing.
I went in, and I came out.
I'm tall and robust, but nothing that got stuck in a tank somewhere happened," he told Russia Sluzhba Novostei radio.
Zotov’s words are supported by the fact that no photos of the alleged jam have been published, even though a total of 50,000 people visited the weapons exhibition in a few days.
The allegation of Zotov’s getting stuck started with an article on Bloknot.ru, in which Zotov was told he was struggling to get out of the tank door and threatened to shoot everyone around him if he didn’t get out of the way.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up story in which the organisers of the exhibition told their own view of what had happened.
Everyone is just used to the fact that soldiers quickly jump out of armored vehicles.
But MP Zotov, due to his large size, simply lingered when he came out.
But under no circumstances did he sit there for five hours," Alexander Pisarevski, the coordinator of the exhibition, told Bloknot.

The 1962 Lassen candelabra by the architect brothers Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) looks like it was designed today.
The cubic steel frame is like a work of art, and it was originally.

A leak has occurred at the Kittilän mine of Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian-owned mining company.
The purified process water from the gold mine has leaked from the so-called tailings pond into the ditch.
According to the company, measures to correct the leak have been initiated.
The pool contains neutralised tailings from the flotation process and purified process water.
In general, the water is pumped either to be reused as process water or, according to the permit, to be discharged through a surface run-off field into the environment.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic meters per hour when it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of the leaked water meets the current permit conditions.
No other material spilled into the environment.
The leak was discovered Monday morning.
The leak has not been found to cause structural damage to the dam structures of the basin.
The company says it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and remedy the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent employees.
IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish country report published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) largely follows the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation urged Finland to carry out comprehensive structural reforms in order to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime pay and paid holidays would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms are needed in the entire contract system and in unemployment security.
According to Pasi Kuoppamäki, Chief Economist at Danske Bank, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
The IMF’s assessment contains a lot of positive messages for the government’s actions, but on the other hand, there are also words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
These include, for example, infrastructure investments, says Kuoppamäki to Taloussanomat.
In the IMF’s view, growth projects should also be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF forecasts a 0.4 per cent economic growth for Finland this year, which will accelerate to 0.9 per cent next year.
In its new cyclical forecast, Danske expects growth to remain at zero this year.
The IMF is more optimistic this year.
They may have been based on the latest findings.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported a slight increase in total output in the summer, says Kuoppamäki.
Less attention could be paid to the weakened confidence of industry or other so-called softer indicators.
However, the difference is only a few percent.
Nintendo has appointed a new director.
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked for Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start working on Wednesday, Nintendo said on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for the successful launch of the Wii console.
The choice of the 65-year-old Kimishima is no big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as a possible successor to Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow in Iwata’s footsteps, according to Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda.
Kimishima’s mission is to bring Nintendo to mobile games, but not to eat the company’s bread on the side of traditional game consoles.
More and more underage asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
The Swedish Immigration Agency admitted in February 2015 that hundreds of children are missing every year.
According to SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, hundreds of underage applicants disappear every year.
Juha Kannelmaa, Senior Officer of the Finnish Immigration Service, explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is it the same in Finland?
How many of the applicants disappear "under the ground" in a year?- In 2013, a total of 156 asylum applications were made for unaccompanied minors in Finland.
9 of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were made and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelmaa says.
The reason for the disappearance may be that, in the course of the proceedings, it becomes clear that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of legal age there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue the processing of the matter in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for the processing of the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 applications were decided to lapse due to the fact that the applicant had probably moved away from Finland, meaning that adult asylum seekers disappeared during the last 123 years, he says.
Is the number increasing?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications from unaccompanied minors.
There are still no overall statistics on the number of underage asylum seekers who have disappeared this year, but the number of underage asylum seekers is known and has clearly increased, which is also likely to have an impact on the number of those who have disappeared, he emphasises.
What happens to those who are turned away?
Will they also disappear, for example, into the ‘dark labour market’?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for the enforcement of deportation decisions,” Kannelmaa emphasises.
Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (KKK) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered applicants.
He has taken action in this matter.
Orpo, who discussed refugee issues at the meeting of EU interior ministers, spoke on Monday about practical measures to bring the flow of asylum seekers to northern Finland under control through Sweden.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see photos of the devices
The equipment used by media pioneer Timo T.A. Mikkonen for TV and radio productions is now on sale.
Mikkonen’s wife Nina Mikkonen sells equipment on Huuto.net, which was once one of the most advanced professional equipment in its field.
The online advertisement was first reported by the online magazine Iltamakasiini.
Nowadays, a large part of the equipment has been left behind by technological progress.
In the digital media world, television programs are no longer filmed on Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that interested people will be found.
Of course, the hardware is no longer up-to-date in that way, but these are also needed as long as there is such old-generation material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of enthusiasts - collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen thinks to IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset is trying to move out of his current Myrskylän home.
There's no way we can take all that stuff with us.
Gradually I have started to take inventory and see what things are discarded.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no longer any use for TV or radio.
After recent strokes, it is clear that a man with a long career will not return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen’s life’s work was archived already in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives visited Myrskylä to pick up a box full of films and other material.
Traffic threatens to become more dangerous than expected: Metro and trams may stop for the whole Friday
Metro and tram drivers will decide today whether to extend the force in connection with Friday’s demonstration.
The original plan was to stop the metro and tram traffic only for the duration of the demonstration on Friday.
In the afternoon, it will be decided whether the traffic will stop for the whole day.
Chief confidant Pekka Hirvonen says that the threat on the field is great.
The cuts in night shifts and shifts are a real pain in the ass for drivers, so the government's plans to cut back on the extras are met with opposition.
However, Hirvonen thinks that stopping traffic for the whole day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stop by Friday, public transport in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area will be practically completely stopped.
According to VR, trains do not run between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Friday.
There will be no long-distance or short-distance traffic on Fridays.
Trains leaving before 6 a.m. will be driven to the destination stations.
According to HSL, most of the buses remain in the depot.
AKT members will be absent from work from 3 a.m. on Friday to 3 a.m. on Saturday.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, they are driven by supervisors, says Pirkko Repo, HSL’s spokesman.
Repo says HSL is not able to say exactly which bus services run on Friday.
Workers’ organisations will organise a large-scale demonstration at Helsinki Railway Square on Friday from 11 am to 1 pm.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place at the Hungarian-Serbian border, where many refugees are trying to make their way to Europe, the Associated Press reported.
According to Sky News, the refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water cannons against people.
Muslim Boy Arrested at Texas School After Teacher Thinks His Clock Was a Bomb
Ahmed Mohamed, a 14-year-old from Texas, has been arrested in the United States after a teacher described his homemade watch as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he only wanted to showcase the output of his electronics hobby.
One of the teachers, however, thought the watch looked like a bomb.
The police were called and the situation ended with the boy being taken in handcuffs to a juvenile detention cell.
Mohammed never claimed anything other than that he had made a watch.
Still, it's still possible that the boy was accused of making a fake bomb.
Mohamed said the watch looked like a “movie bomb.”
The watch is in police custody, but it reportedly consisted of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident happened last Monday, and Mohamed was sentenced to three days of compulsory school leave.
His father is furious about the incident, and the country’s American-Islamic Council wonders if the incident is yet another manifestation of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain's Labour leader refuses to sing national anthem
The song asks God to protect the Queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticisms voiced by the right-leaning press have also been echoed by members of Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has hurt the public, Labour MP Kate Green said in a BBC radio interview.
Green thought Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday's commemoration paid tribute to the British Air Force pilots' fight against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
In his official statement, the Labour Party defends Mr Corbyn, stressing that he had paid tribute to the pilots by attending the event.
We all owe a huge debt of gratitude to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national anthem, the statement emphasized.
Corbyn’s election as party leader has split the Labour ranks.
There are those, especially among MPs, who fear that he will expel moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn is in favour of unilateral disarmament, an end to austerity and an increase in public spending.
For the first time today, Mr Corbyn is due to appear in Parliament as party leader during Question Time with the Prime Minister.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what to ask Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron tweeted this week about Corbyn’s election as party leader.
“The Labour Party is threatening our national security, our economic security and the security of our families,” he tweeted.
Minnesota family's cause of death remains unclear, family's father faces trial
The South Lake Minnetonka Police Department has been investigating the murder of a family in Greenwood, Minnesota.
The family of five were found dead in their home on September 10, and a few days later, police confirmed that the shooter was their father, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife and three children with a shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage.
They've been dead for days.
The family was found after the school was concerned about the children’s absence.
Based on this report, police went to the house for an inspection visit and found Short’s family dead in various parts of the huge house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A Million Dollars and a Successful Company
The case of South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Michael Siitari is still under investigation.
The motive for the bloodshed remains unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and had created his fortune on the nurses social media site AllNurses.com.
In a 2014 interview with StarTribune, Short reported that the site had four million unique visitors each week.
I've had 50 takeover bids from the company in the last ten years.
I have rejected all of them.
I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe I’ll sell the company, but not yet.
In 2011, the Short family bought a house in Greenwood for $2 million.
The house is advertised on the real estate website Zillow as a car collector’s dream: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also a garage sufficient for eight cars.
Litigation pending
According to StarTribune, however, the father of the family was facing a lawsuit.
He had been sued by Achieve Test Prep, a provider of various prep courses, for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, Short’s website had not removed any comments defamatory of prep courses, and as a result, they had lost customers to their competitors.
According to StarTribune, however, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a significant impact on Short’s business operations.
Vesku Loiri offered cake coffee
In addition, the owner trio was awarded the Hippos Horse Owner of the Month award.
This is great, Loiri commented cheerfully on his plaque.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September, earning €100,000.
Artist legend Loiri was still confused by Fabrice Duo’s success in the big competition.
I still don't believe it's happened.
Coach Korpi, a successful horse, gets full peace of mind when working with the horse.
Pekka decides where the horse will be taken to compete.
And I'll shut the fuck up, Loiri grunted.
NHL star makes 'greatest donation ever made by an athlete'
Montreal Canadiens superstar P.K. Subban has donated $10 million to the Montreal Children’s Hospital.
The hospital said it was the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to a charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising efforts for the next seven years.
Subban signed the Canadiens a year ago for a contract worth $72 million.
Subban’s donation is significantly higher than his $9 million annual earnings.
As a reward for his donation, Subban receives a lobby bearing his name from the hospital.
Canadian players have helped many hospitals in the past.
The long-time captain Jean Beliveau, who passed away a year ago, collected millions of dollars for the same children’s hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a huge amount of money for another city’s main hospital, which provided the hospital with the PET scanner needed for cancer research.
You can order a wife for the evening from a Japanese cafe - serves food only in bikinis and an apron
Themed cafes are a big deal in Japan.
There is already a goat café, a rabbit café, a vampire café, a fish café and now a wife café.
It strikes the lonely, the needy, the hungry.
This is reported by Metro.
You can order a wife or husband for the evening from the Ore no Yome café in Tokyo.
It's a waiter pretending to be the client's spouse.
The "spouse" is selected from the list before entering the cafe and prepares and serves food.
The wife is only up against the apron and bikini, while the husband is up against the tight cycling shorts.
The website provides all the information about the wife candidates, from height and weight to the type of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
150 million vehicles will soon be connected to the network: Car security attacks begin to be armed
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technology development and innovation in the industry, Intel said in a statement.
The committee is made up of top security experts from around the world.
ASRB researchers will conduct ongoing safety tests and inspections to standardize best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel announced the first version of best practices in cybersecurity.
The company will update the report on the basis of the ASRB’s findings.
The international ICT research and consulting company Gartner estimates that by 2020 approximately 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are capable of consuming, creating and sharing web-based data.
“We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars,” said Chris Young, president of Intel Security.
The ASRB will enable Intel to establish best practices for security and support the view that cybersecurity is a key component in the design of every connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world’s leading innovators in computing.
The Ford Focus RS costs around 52,000 euros in Finland!
The Ford Focus RS has been waiting for years to come.
The car is finally in sight in Finland.
Ford has announced the RS at the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Ford’s new all-wheel drive RS accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in 4.7 seconds thanks to a 2.3-litre 350-horsepower engine and has a top speed of 266 km/h.
In Finland, the price is also interesting: it is initially estimated to be EUR 52,000.
The car is now available for order, although Ford does not say when the first cars will arrive in Finland.
Favorite brand Kia presented at the Frankfurt Motor Show two novelties - such are the new Sportage and Optima
More important than the two new models in Finland is the new fourth-generation Sportage, which Kia plans to use to capture a larger segment of the ever-growing SUV market.
The new Sportage in shape, created under the leadership of Gregory Guillaume, European Design Director, is rounder than before.
The wheelbase and outer dimensions have become a centimeter here and there, and the car is splitting the air even more efficiently.
The engine line-up remains largely unchanged, with the addition of a 1.6-litre turbocharged engine that develops 177 horsepower.
Find out more about the Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption closer to launch.
We will have to wait a little longer, because the new Sportage will arrive in the spring of 2016.
Even before the turn of the year, the new Kia Optimat arrived in Finland.
It doesn’t seem to have changed, but it’s a completely new car.
Kia intends to win the hearts of upper-middle class buyers with improved driving characteristics, lower noise levels and higher-quality equipment.
Start with the Optimas with a 1.7-litre turbodiesel and 2.0-litre petrol engine.
Next summer, the pace will pick up with the arrival of the Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbocharged engine.
At the same time with its arrival, the sale of the Optima farm begins.
Chisu is back on the stage with a bold jumpsuit.
Singer Chisu will be at the Life for a Child concert with other Finnish stars.
The electric blue pantsuit has an open neckline.
The outfit beautifully showcases the graceful waist of the singer-star.
The crowning glory of the collection is a golden metal belt and red lipstick.
During the three-year break, the singer, who became a mother, has been able to shed the pregnancy kilos with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will soon be one year old.
The singer released her first single from a new album in August.
Coming back to the stage and standing in front of the audience after a long break doesn’t really excite me.
I’ve missed all the music-related things, the singer says.
In a couple of weeks, Chisu will release his new and fourth album called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired me to make new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu thinks.
Kim Kardashian's Maternity Style Stuns Again, Now Shows Her Chest
Reality TV beauty Kim Kardashian gives one topic after another.
She shows off her pregnancy belly and breasts in sexy clothes, most recently last night at 1:00 A.M., when she and her sister Kourtney Kardashian left a gig with Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent at the breast.
When the flashing lights flash, it reveals the skin-colored bra under the dress.
The last time Kardashian wore an Amazon-style maternity outfit was when she visited a friend at a dinner party in New York just a few days ago.
The outfit was accentuated by black over-knee boots.
The third special maternity outfit is as fresh as it was last Friday, when I was introduced to my tummy.
The Hard Laws of the Model World: No Home, You're Lonely, the Competition is Terrible
Top model Manon Leloup wanted to straighten out the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary, Speaking Dolls, in which Leloup and his colleagues talk their mouths out of the model business.
Harpeer's Bazaar magazine gathered Leloup's six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season starts from scratch.
Even if you had posed for the previous season in top designer outfits, the new season will start with castings again.
And every season, there are new, fresh faces coming into the industry, competing for jobs with more experienced ones.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
Work is a continuous journey, and it can take a year to make a hotel room or an apartment where fashion houses can accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearable.
New York and Paris are desirable jobs, but they are the most stressful.
It's not just one kind of thinness.
An agent in New York might ask you to lose a few pounds, but in Paris, they'll say you're too skinny.
Getting a job is always a risk.
During Fashion Weeks, models and designers are together all the time, and at the same time act as a support network.
When fashion weeks are over, the difference is sad.
Models want to enter this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they are gnawed by the fact that everyone thinks work is just a display of clothes.
They also want to be their own personalities.
Work makes models feel like they’re actors with a role.
But you can also express yourself in the work of the model.
The models at Tory Burch's show last night.
Fashion Week is taking place in New York City, where designers are unveiling their collections for next year.
Roope Salminen, who has changed his style, plays the most unknown Apulanta musician in the film
Based on the early years of Apulanta, Roope Salminen plays the founding member of the band, Antti Lautala.
Lautala formed Apulanta in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but left the band in 1994.
After all, this is a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm about to turn 26 years old as a rap artist, and in this film I'm playing a 16-year-old guitarist.
I have not wanted to meet the real Antti before the photoshoot because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown person in the group, so I think it’s good that I’m only learning his playing style from the video.
I don't want to make an imitation of a human.
The man who leads the completely empty Roope Salminen and Koirat band will not take on the role.
Punk-manners come naturally to a man.
In the punk episode of Stars, Stars, I’m sure many people saw a foretaste, as well as if they’ve ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything short, we always go full throttle.
Tuukka Temonen, who played bass in Apulanta from 1993 to 2004, directed the main actors of the film Teit usilun k<0xC3><0xBC>lain (You Make Us Beautiful).
The core of the band, which has become known to the public, is played by young actors still quite unknown to the general public.
The drummer Sipe Santapukki is played by Teppo Manner, the singer Toni Wirta by Tatu Sinisalo by bassist Tuukka Temo by Iiro Panula.
Scrooge Salminen gave hints about his future employment as early as last night, when he told Snapchat that he was mysteriously preparing for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already posted on Instagram a picture of her new look, which she has had to implement for the film.
Scrooge, previously seen in his moustache and chin beard, has shaved his face into smooth possum and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to think about how to inform their children about the situation of refugees trying to reach Europe.
Or is it worth telling at all?
You don’t have to force it, advises Ferdinand Garoff, a member of the SPR’s crisis team.
Younger children should be protected and not, for example, allowed to watch the news alone.
Young children may not always be able to understand what they are seeing, and it can linger in their minds and be distressing, she says.
However, if the child has come across news images of refugees on television or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth bringing it up.
It is good to have a conversation about the child’s starting point and listen carefully to what he or she is asking.
Your child’s fears may be surprising.
They are not necessarily the ones that the parent thinks he is afraid of.
You should not scare your child unnecessarily, even if you feel anxious and scared.
The younger child closely follows the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child also feels safe.
Older children are likely to come across conversations about refugees at school, with friends or online.
It is a good idea for parents to discuss the matter with them if the child is concerned.
The fact is that not everyone in the world is doing well.
Together with the children, parents can reflect on how this is viewed in our family.
After all, is the world a safe or an unsafe place?
Parents may also have different upbringing perspectives – some may want to protect their children from anxiety as much as possible.
On the other hand, if the family also talks about difficult things, the child gets a model on how to deal with the difficulties in life.
This may be useful to him in the future.

Your own strength at the end?

Vermo-hitting Flash of Balls is hard to contain
Perttu Pohjola was able to refine Apila’s ball flash to strike in midsummer.
It was all about wins and second places, until at the end of July the rally in Tampere came to a crash.
Since the stallion was severely congealed, the trainer suspected something was wrong and ordered time for his protégé to see a veterinarian.
The explanation for the outage came from the endoscopy.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not the mildest, but required two courses of medication to overcome it.
Since Apila’s Flash had to be on light exercise, Pohjola says that he was positively surprised by the horse’s last run.
It was the second SE mare in Turku after Taruntuul in record time.
Apila’s Thunderball was under a lot of pressure from the break, as it had only been possible to drive normally for a few weeks.
Considering those things, a small bend in the end was understandable, Pohjola says.
The coach assumes that a proper race gave the stallion the edge.
The horse’s tone certainly went from there, and hopefully it would have evened out as well.
Apilan Pallosalama has been known as the horses of humor.
If you don’t like it, you can throw it away without getting sick.
On a good day, however, a flash of lightning has come off the stallion that the opponents have been amazed.
At long-distance speed, competitors cannot compete with the Ball Flash, which even gives off warm-blooded rides.
Pohjola hopes to have a bowling run in Vermo.
What is different, however, is how the Apila Ball Flash agrees to it.
It's quite difficult at the time of departure and it might even go under the boom of the departure car and so on.
I hope you are calmer than before.
When Apila’s Thunderball is in good shape, he can also come from the front, and we’re going to use it to win, the coach promises.
This is why you can't get rid of useless iPhone apps
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the apps that come with Apple’s iPhones may be uninstalled sometime in the future – but not quite all of them.
Apple may remove some of its own apps from iPhones in the future, CEO Tim Cook said in an interview with Buzzfeed.
There are a number of apps on Apple’s iPhone that are relatively rarely used: For example, FaceTime calls, Newsstand, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts, and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is the Apple Watch, which came as a forced update to iPhones, although it is only necessary for owners of Apple smartwatches.
According to Cook, removing Apple’s apps is more complicated than it seems.
Some apps are linked to someone else on your iPhone.
If they are removed, it could cause problems somewhere else on the phone,” Cook told Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple’s iPhone apps worked closely with other apps.
There are other programs that don’t work that way.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is investigating the matter because the company doesn’t want to waste memory on users’ iPhones.
Inflation in the euro area slowed down to 0.1 per cent in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only marginally in August, by 0.1 per cent year-on-year, the EU’s statistical authority Eurostat reported today.
The rise in prices was driven down by lower energy prices.
In this way, Eurostat revised its forecast of 0.2% a few weeks ago slightly downwards.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2 per cent.
Core inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's forecast for core inflation was 1.0%.
In the euro area, energy was 7.2 per cent cheaper last month than a year ago.
The average inflation rate in the whole 28 EU countries was at zero in August.
In July, there was an increase of 0.1 per cent.
Among the euro area countries, consumer prices rose most, by 1.4 per cent, in Malta in August.
In Cyprus, inflation was the lowest at 1.9%, with prices falling.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent negative according to the EU harmonised price index.
Inflation in the euro area remains persistently far from the European Central Bank (ECB) target of a price increase of around 2% over the medium term.
The ECB is forecasting an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
The rise will pick up to 1.1% next year, the central bank forecast in its new inflation forecasts published in early September.
U.S. Fed to try to tighten monetary policy
The next recession in the U.S. will begin in less than a year, but more likely in three years, after the Fed starts raising interest rates again.
And in the financial markets, the recession begins before the next recession.
The Fed has hinted that it may begin raising interest rates this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession could topple at its fastest by next autumn and the financial markets before that.
Or at least that is what will happen if the world’s largest economy and financial markets act as they used to – and react to the Fed’s tightening of its money taps as they have done in the past.
These are the conclusions reached by Deutsche Bank London market research strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed a 60-page long-term asset return study to major international customers last week.
The strategists who produced the study and report do not pretend to know exactly when the Fed will start raising interest rates or what will happen in the economy and markets thereafter.
Instead, they use cool facts and calculations from economic statistics to show how the economy and markets have behaved in the past during and after the Fed’s interest rate hikes.
In addition to historical observations, they look at which key variables in the economy and financial markets are now on the same or a different model than they were at the time of the previous interest rate hikes – and what the possible consequences might be.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a shaky condition to withstand the rise in interest rates than at any time since the 1950s.
Maybe not even a year into the recession.
Throughout last summer and early autumn, the Fed’s monetary policy and its current stance have been hinting that the time is ripe to raise interest rates.
The first increase in interest rates in more than nine years could come as early as this week.
The matter will be resolved during Wednesday and Thursday, when the Fed's Board of Governors, the so-called Open Market Committee, meets to decide on the matter for its two-day meeting.
The last time the Fed raised its so-called Fed funds steering rate was in June 2006.
That marked the end of exactly two years of relatively regular, but small, 0.25-percentage-point hikes in which the Fed raised its interest rate from 1.25% to 5.25%.
Financial market turmoil began in 2007 with the most risky housing financing in the United States, and a year later, the financial crisis erupted into a global doomsday nightmare.
The Great Recession came in 2009.
Last time, the severe setbacks in the financial markets and the real economy started at a slower pace than has typically been the case since the previous Fed interest rate hikes.
Similarly, the trials were harder and more severe than at any time since the depression of the 1930’s.
Deutsche’s strategists have screened the rise and fall of the world’s largest economies and financial markets since 1950, and in some places since the early 19th century.
They have been reporting on the Fed’s interest rate hikes and their economic and financial impact since the 1950s.
At its fastest, less than a year has passed since the first interest rate hike, usually less than three years and less than three and a half years on average.
The rise in the financial markets has ended within a year or two of the Fed’s interest rate hikes.
Since the early 1950s, the Fed has in turn raised and lowered its policy rate for a dozen cycles of varying lengths.
Each occasion has differed from the others in some respects, and the narrator is relatively scarce in the examination, so it is hardly possible to infer from them anything certain about the effects of subsequent interest rate increases.
But this time, many things are different.
And not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
The decisive causes of the financial crisis, let alone the culprits, cannot necessarily be established even by decades of research.
But three reasons that led to the crisis and increased its destructive power are probably somewhat indisputably clear:
1) In the 21st century, the Fed, the ECB and other major central banks in the world kept their key interest rates too low for too long.
They patched up the traces of the techno-bubble, while growing the next one.
2) Over the decades, the already excessive amounts of debt accumulated in various parts of the financial and real economy grew even larger as a result of the excessive monetary policy of the central banks.
It was the largest debt bubble in economic history.
3) In particular, the almost unchecked lunatic debt financing of the financial economy inflated some of the biggest bubbles in the history of the financial markets, from equities to real estate, bonds and commodities.
There is hardly any serious controversy about the fact that the financial markets, soaring to heights with increasingly complex leverage, were in an unusually dangerous and volatile state when the Fed and other central banks last pushed interest rates up.
The debt-leveraged financial structures, let alone valuation bubbles, lasted only a short time after the interest rate hikes had begun and the costs of debt financing had started to rise.
Risks materialised as a financial crisis, followed by a major recession.
More money and more debt
Deutsche's strategists do not speculate on what will happen next, but give cause for thought by mentioning, for example, the following factors:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now considered their monetary policy stance to be more accommodative for even longer than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower for even longer.
2) Indebtedness has not been as cheap for a long time as it was ten years ago, and now debt money is literally cheaper than free money.
As a result, the debt burden of the financial and real economy has not eased, but the debt burden in different parts of the economy is now much heavier than before the financial crisis or towards it at any time before.
(3) Central bank liquidity has for the most part remained in the financial markets, leaving the most important classes of securities and assets at their highest prices since the peak before the financial crisis or at any time.
And strategists are not only plaguing the mood with warning signals from the financial markets, but they are also pointing out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and from the worst recession in decades to the model it has seen in the past.
The euro area economy has barely recovered.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but correspondingly, financial market pressures and risks are incomparably greater than they were before the financial crisis, when the Fed next starts tightening its taps.
Perhaps Albert Edwards, the strategist of the French bank Societe Generale, is not as strange as it may seem.
For a long time, he has been training the bank’s international investor clients for the following U-turns of the Fed:
First the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst - and soon the Fed will have time to put out the financial fires with even bigger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) plans to cut up to 33,000 jobs.
Most of the reductions are targeted at HP’s business services side, the company says.
In November, HP will split into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which focuses on business sales, and HP Inc., which focuses on consumer PCs and printers.
HP had a peak of 350000 employees in 2011.
In October last year, the number of staff had been reduced to 302000.
The company recognises non-recurring expenses of USD 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion) from the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise is cutting 25,000 to 30,000 employees.
Consumer cuts will remain at 3,300 within three years.
HP plans to relocate to low-cost countries with 60 percent of its workforce in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers are responsible for more than 10% of its operating profit.
In the previous year, its three most significant customers accounted for 65 per cent of operating profit.
iOS 9: How to Get a New Operating System on iPhone After Apple Update Release
You can request a new operating system by going to the Settings app, clicking on "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
If the update is ready, your phone will give you the option to download and then install it.
Some people have had problems with this installation after the "Software Update Failed" error message has appeared.
To bypass this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst traffic to pass or attempt an update through iTunes.
The phone guides the user in the final process.
This may include uninstalling apps to get space, but Apple has reduced the possibility of this by reducing the size of the update and also made the process easier with a new tool that suggests which apps to uninstall and then reinstall once the update is complete.
It’s a good idea to make sure your phone is charged or close to the charger during the update so that you don’t run out of battery.
If the charge level is too low, Apple will not allow the update to proceed because if the battery runs out, it may lead to a violation of the update.

It’s also worth making sure that you’ve gone through our list of things to do before downloading to make sure things don’t go wrong, and how you can protect yourself if they do. iOS 9 brings new features like a much smarter personal assistant and tons of new productivity features for iPad, along with improvements that speed up and fix the OS.
Yle: Minister Berner has served on the board of a tax haven company
Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner (Centre Party) has served as a member of the board of the tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company’s operations involve so-called tax planning.
It concerns the Luxembourg-based company Saltri II LuxCo, for which Berner was appointed a member of the Board of Directors in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Board of Directors.
Berner said he resigned from the club in May this year.
I checked it out, and it's enough that I've filed a resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place on the agreed schedule,” says Berner in an interview with Yle.
Membership after the merger
The Luxembourg-based company manages the holdings of the Swedish company Kährs.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with the Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served on the Board of Directors of Karelia-Upofloor from 2010 to 2013 and after the merger on the Board of Directors of Kährs and the Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, Kährs’ holdings in Luxembourg pass through a multi-tier ownership structure.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted board membership in a Luxembourg company at the request of Kährs’ second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been on the board of Karelia-Upofloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was looking for a partner, who was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a private equity investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to take care of the capital benefits of a Finnish family company.
It is important that we ensure that the income from our Finnish companies’ capital is taxed in Finland, and that the starting point was safeguarded in this context,” says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital’s holdings in the company do not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure of the tax haven is due to the fact that Kährs’ largest shareholder, the private equity fund Triton, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
A reception centre maintained by a company opens in Espoo
The first reception centre for adult asylum seekers will be opened in Otaniemi, Espoo.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 residents starting at 6 p.m. today.
The number of seats can increase to a maximum of 300-400 people within a week.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre in the former Rescue Institute.
The operations are maintained by Luona Oy, which is mainly engaged in the production of health care and medical care services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy agreed on the security arrangements of the centre, among other things.
STTK is preparing an alternative blackmail package for working life
STTK is starting to prepare an alternative package for the government’s tightening of working life.
The organisation also hopes to see other employee centre organisations.
According to President Antti Palola, attention is currently focused on Friday’s demonstration.
Alternative ways to reduce the price of labor will be returned after that.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola pointed out to reporters during a break from the organization’s administration meeting.
Palola believes that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) is not ready for discussions.
STTK’s economists have calculated that the change security included in the Government’s competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, while the other side of the package is EUR 2,700 million.
I do not know whether the party has a tremendous interest in holding a debate if there is a ratio of one to one hundred on the debtor side.
Palola: Negotiation has been constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party) has called for alternative proposals by Wednesday, as the Government is then expected to submit a communication on its own package to Parliament and begin the preparation of reforms.
He did not say whether the timetable was realistic.
According to Palola, the dialogue with the government exists, and it has always been constructive for him.
According to Palola, the cutting of Sunday supplements is a sore spot for the union STTK.
The organization expects the government to withdraw from the mandatory legislation it would use to enforce part of the blackmail.
According to Palola, the STTK does not warm up to preparing an alternative package with the SDP, which has discussed the issue.
Workers will gather in Helsinki on Friday to protest against the labour blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, wages for the first sick days will be cut, overtime pay will be halved, Sunday pay will be reduced to 75% and holidays will be reduced.
STTK stresses that the central organisations have invited employees to a demonstration, and the intention has not been to organise a strike.
Akavan Fjäder
Akava’s Chairman Sture Fjäder congratulates STTK on its announcement of the preparation of the alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now on the same page as Akava, as an alternative model for the Government’s proposals has been outlined in Akava for a long time.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, because without SAK the package will not be comprehensive enough.
Sture Fjäder, chairman of Akava, hopes that SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will participate in the preparation of the proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
Antti Palolan STTK said earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
Akava announced on Wednesday that it has been preparing its own proposal for a long time, with which it is ready to negotiate the government’s target of a five per cent competitiveness jump as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has always been ready to negotiate, and we have been writing an alternative model for government proposals for a long time.
We are prepared to consider the terms of employment as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks,” says Chairman Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also join Akava’s lines, as STTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without the SAK, the package will not be strong enough.
We are now preparing a model that works for the government and employers,” Fjäder says.
The Bureau of Akava will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"Same boat, joint coal, work together" - play bingo while Sipilä talks in the evening
University of Tampere Green Left
Viva’s bingo ticket for the University of Tampere’s Green Left.
The Prime Ministers have previously given speeches on exceptions during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä will speak to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on Yle’s channels on Wednesday evening at 21.05.
When applying for a similar prime minister’s previous speech, one has to go back to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was prime minister when he gave the famous radio speech that marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
After that, the President and the ministers gave several radio speeches during the Winter and Continuation Wars.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year’s speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the strike of train operators with a televised speech.
Single-call, monarchist style
All day long, the speech of Sipilä has aroused criticism and speculations about what is to come.
Chairman of the Left Alliance Paavo Arhinmäki said on Twitter that "Sipilä could give her speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow for discussion of the speech".
According to the Greens, "we've already seen a monologue.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
Erkki Tuomioja of the Social Democratic Party of Finland (SDP) condemned on Facebook the “monarchist approach: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for them”.
Antti Rinne, Chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Finland, challenged Sipilä for dialogue: "Soon six months after the elections.
Not a single appearance by the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
We've tried.
What is <0x40>juhacipila afraid of?
Public service
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Sipilä’s speech has been pre-recorded and takes about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it will be commented on live by SAK Chairman Lauri Lyly and EK Managing Director Jyri Häkämies.
He has been criticized for making a speech.
We considered the matter and concluded that it is part of the public service mission to promote publicity covering the whole of Finland,” says Ismo Silvo, Director of Yle’s publications.
Like We in the Time of the Tammelas
The speech also provoked ridicule.
In the evening dinner is served well in advance, the children are combed and dressed to their best.
My mom wears the prettiest sweater, and my dad puts on a tie around his neck.
At 9 a.m., people will be quiet in front of the television as they used to be in the days of Me Tammelat,” writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"Will Prime Minister Sipilä also explain in his speech why there are millionaires hiding their capital in tax havens in the Finnish government, who are drafting amnesty laws for their other tax evaders and at the same time are telling the people that it is necessary to cut back when the state runs out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
The Green Left Viva of the University of Tampere makes one guess from what Sipilä says.
It has posted bingo on Facebook.
Will we hear tonight about the same boat, the same coal, living on debt, and team spirit?
The coupons and pens are ready, at 21:05 it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Suomi and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in the Guardian: Western countries rejected Russia’s proposal to replace Assad
More than three years ago, the West rejected Russia’s offer to abdicate Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, President Martti Ahtisaari told the Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the UN proposed a plan that would have allowed Assad to leave power in style after some time.
The West, however, did not take up the proposal, believing that Assad would fall within a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador, Vitaliy Churkin, listed a three-point plan for him in a bilateral conversation: the opposition could not be armed, there had to be an immediate dialogue between the opposition and al-Assad, and the abdication of al-Assad had to be carried out in moderation.
I know Churkin.
We may not agree on everything, but we can talk openly.
I told him what I did there and he said sit down, Martti, and I’ll tell him what we have to do,” Ahtisaari said in an interview with The Guardian.
Diplomats do not comment.
Ahtisaari said he had conveyed Churkin’s message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Churkin did not confirm the content of the discussion to the newspaper, but according to Ahtisaari, there are no two words about it.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari’s claims, but said that al-Assad’s forces had already committed several massacres at the time and that key opposition groups had refused any deal that would have left him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, the former head of the British Foreign Office’s Middle East department, is hesitant about Ahtisaari’s remarks because, in his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of Assad.
Russia has supported Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari’s claim is that Churkin spoke on Moscow’s authority.
If he had told me about what Churkin said, I would have replied that I wanted to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so I could take it seriously.
Jenkins said he would have suspected that it was Putin’s trick to keep power over some of Assad’s supporters.
The Refugee Flow Our Own Actions
During the negotiations held by Ahtisaari, some 7,500 people had been killed in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the death toll exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes as a result of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The influx of refugees into Europe is our own doing.
I don't see any other choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we ourselves caused,” Ahtisaari tells the newspaper.
Asylum seekers’ arrangement centre by turkish to Tornio
The Finnish Government’s plan for an asylum seeker centre in Northern Finland is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be established in the empty Tornion yhteisyseo building in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable place to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat reported on Tuesday that the council had already decided to present the school building as a space solution to the ministry.
According to Sauli Hy<0xC3><0xB6>ppinen, Vice-Chairman of Tornio City Council (left), this is not true.
When the entire council was not in session and some of the group wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the council to a meeting next Monday to decide on the matter.
There were 36 delegates out of 43.
Thirteen councillors opposed the organizing centre.
Based on this, one would expect the decision to be positive, Hy<0xC3><0xB6>ppinen says.
Mayor Timo Nousiainen said the city was contacted on Monday and reacted quickly.
The joint Lyseo could accommodate approximately 500 asylum seekers at a time.
An expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple of hundred meters from the border, so it would work in that sense as well, Nousiainen says.
Sipilä still wants an alternative to blackmail in the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre), the public halving of holiday pay would only partially take care of the reduction in the price of work sought by the government.
However, the Government will be happy to accept an alternative package if the social partners manage to agree on one.
In parliament, Sipilä told reporters that he had not been in contact with labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously the organizations were looking for ways to compensate for the government-announced tightening of the working life.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
Sipilä believes that halving the holiday pay would be a useful measure, as it would target almost all wage and salary earners, unlike, for example, the government’s planned cut in Sunday bonuses.
Labour market organisations could agree among themselves on a cut in holiday pay, as they are recorded in collective agreements instead of in the law.
The Government is expected to present a Government communication to Parliament next Wednesday on the tightening of working life.
According to Sipilä, the organisations’ proposals should be known before then.
This is not the final deadline either.
The legislative work will then begin, i.e. the train is on the move and it will become more and more difficult.
There's plenty of time.
It doesn’t take long if you have the will to do something like this.
The list published by the Government last week includes, among other things, the conversion of Epiphany and Ascension Day into unpaid holidays without reducing annual working hours.
In addition, pay for the first sick days will be cut, overtime pay will be halved, Sunday pay will be reduced to 75% and holidays will be reduced.
The reforms will be implemented as mandatory legislation bypassing the trade unions, which has attracted strong criticism.
Workers’ central organisations are organising a large-scale demonstration on Friday, and several trade unions have also declared political strikes.
The Tohmajärvi Council approved the expansion of the Juicy Hall storage
The Tohmajärvi council unanimously approved the expansion of Nordic Koivu Oy’s hall, or sap hall, with a slight murmur.
The reason for the criticism was that the project is bigger and more expensive than originally discussed.
There is also a busy schedule.
It was also a bit of a surprise that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous expansion was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of the warehouse on 400-450 square meters was approved in the investment programme, but the money will be decided later in the interim report.
Another item on the agenda was an investment of EUR 150 000 to 200 000, but at the meeting, Technical Director Erkki Ikonen said that the estimated price would be EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it would generate employment and tax revenue for the locality.
There is no risk for the municipality, as the company pays the investment as a rent,” explained Vesa Väist<0xC3><0xB6> (PS.).
The Karelian language has its place in Joensuu
The City Board eased its earlier tough stance on bringing Karelian street signs to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right for the preservation of the Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of Karelian language, because there is no historical basis for it, and Karelian language is not an inherent part of the region’s identity.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has belonged more to the eastern Savonian dialects.
After the new decision, there will be no Karelian street name signs in the city centre.
On a case-by-case basis, however, the City of Joensuu is also prepared to use the Karelian language in information boards and tourism marketing, for example.
The city recommends the same approach to all other actors.
Even though Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, it is worth being open-minded about the use of the Karelian language now that multiculturalism is living and changing strongly in North Karelia as well.
The Karelian language is still a special feature of the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of Finland.
Both of these can be used in a wide range of marketing activities.

The cuts in train connections hit the vitality of the province hard.
Transport connections have a direct impact on the region’s business life and competitiveness.
And it affects whether we can live and work here at all, says Kari Karjalainen, Mayor of Joensuu.
He also mentions air transport, the continuation of which has also been mentioned several times in the report.
It is important for the whole region that our chances of coping are not reduced by government measures, as is currently the case.
We should look at the effects of these suspensions on employment, for example,” Karjalainen emphasises.
The deterioration of transport connections poses an additional challenge to the attractiveness of the University of Eastern Finland.
Of course, the better the services here are, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees,” says Jukka M<0xC3><0xB6>nkk<0xC3><0xB6>nen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor transport connections also affect the research staff, which is very mobile and travels a lot because of the research.
Recruitment Manager Marko Junkkarinen says that it is already difficult to market the university towards Western Finland because of poor cross-border connections.
Currently, about half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland come from outside of Eastern Finland.
Of them, about 10–20 per cent are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by the direct train connection.
I got one of those grit noises from Joensuu to Siu's war
The view of the Joensuu City Board on the regional Siun sote project is seemingly unanimous, but one of the gravel voices is among them.
City Council member Pentti Keskisalo (sd., pictured) proposed to abandon the whole project at the board meeting on Monday, but his proposal fell out of favor.
The Government approved the proposal of Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the meeting of the City Council, which will issue a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train from Kotka to Kouvola will end next year
Passenger train traffic from Kotka to Kouvola will remain in the future, although less than one train pair.
Passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola will change next March.
One train is cancelled, but still five times a day you can get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The cuts are the result of state savings.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications’ purchase money for rail transport for the next four-year period will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be stopped altogether.
VR will draw up new timetables by the end of the year.
They will enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed to the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys ran off.
The rescue service released a 12-year-old boy who climbed to the roof from a climb and could not get off the roof on his own.
The situation arose in Tornionmäki on Ketotie at half past three on Tuesday evening.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladder to the roof.
This did not stop the group of boys who decided to climb up the roof of the house along the radio amateurs’ mast next to it.
The other boys got down the same way, but one didn't.
As a result, the others fled and the passers-by alerted the rescue services to help the last person on the roof safely return to the ground.
FedEx operating profit doubles, lowers outlook for fiscal year 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results in its latest quarter, and the delivery giant cut its full-year earnings forecast due to lower demand for freight services and higher costs for its ground services.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it was hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Its share declined by about 2.5 percent in the opening auction 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening bell.
FedEx Corp. says it expects a tax year-end next May to result in $10.40 to $10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The smaller outlook came despite an average of 4.9 percent price hike that comes into effect on January 4, and despite higher surcharges starting in November for heavy or large parcels on the ground.
The company said it expects operating profit to continue to grow from the previous year because they have cut costs, revenue has grown and e-commerce is growing.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company “is performing steadily, taking into account weaker-than-expected economic conditions, especially in production and global trade.”
Salary plans for the holiday were announced the day after competitor UPS said it plans to hire between 90 and 95,000 extra workers, about the same amount it hired last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx posted earnings of $692 million, an increase of 6 percent on last year.
Earnings per share came to $2.42, which falls short of an average estimate of $2.44. A survey of 12 analysts was conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue increased 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
In the Zacks poll, six analysts were expecting $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has suffered from a decline in international priority shipping, which has halted the development of its Express unit’s net sales.
However, the rise of e-commerce has improved FedEx Ground’s results.
In the last quarter, the net sales of the country unit increased by 29 per cent, but the revenue from operations was basically the same due to the expensive costs of larger parcels and own insurance.
Express unit revenues were better due to higher base charges, while operating profit in freight operations was reduced by higher labour costs.
In the opening auction, about an hour before the opening bell, FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, FedEx closed 11 percent down for this year and 17 percent below the record set on June 11.
Federal Reserve policymakers are sitting around a huge mahogany table for two days this week in a long-awaited meeting to decide whether the time has come to raise the policy rate for the first time in almost a decade.
At the other end of the central bank’s decorative two-story meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Central Bank President Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues must put the nation’s financial interests first.
Congress has placed a dual responsibility on the central bank: to maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable.
After the Great Depression, however, central bank governors have accepted that there is a third unwritten mandate: financial stability.
It is this third requirement that could be the deciding factor in a decision that is so tight that it cannot even be predicted, a decision on whether the US economy is ready to be weaned from the record incentive brought about by the near-zero short-term interest rate since late 2008.
While most of the data shows that the economy is growing steadily, the recent turmoil in global financial markets may have made already wary central bank officials even more alarmed when it comes to increasing volatility. There are fears about what would happen if the federal funds rate were to be raised even by a quarter of a percentage point.
“Obviously, the labour market and inflation are the first and most important factors to be monitored,” says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief financial officer at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“However, I believe that if they are looking for a justification for leaving interest rates unchanged, increased uncertainty in the global market is a valid reason to wait yet,” he says.
No agreement has been reached on the central bank’s decision, which in itself causes nervousness in the economy.
According to a recent study by Bloomberg, about half of economists predict that interest rates will rise this week.
The financial markets, on the other hand, expect the central bank to delay the withdrawal, as the key indicator shows that there is only a 30% chance of growth.
This suggests a decline in the securities market if the central bank raises the level, unless the decision-makers then manage to soften the blow by promising that the next drawdown will not take place in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4 percent, to 16,599.85.
The recovery was driven by expectations that the central bank would maintain its level this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
“It’s surprising if the central bank is raising interest rates right now,” he says.
If policymakers raise interest rates, “they will have to make a lot of effort in their policy to support the financial markets so that they don’t panic.”
Other experts argue that an elevated level would calm the financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the central bank will operate.
Just a month ago, it appeared that the Central Bank would be raising interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point this month, thus taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of the monetary situation that would ensure the stability of the US recovery.
Yellen has stated in the spring and early summer that she expects the level to rise this year, despite the fact that the Liberals are calling for more economic development in their election.
Although job creation slowed in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in seven years and close to what the central bank considers the threshold for full employment.
Wage growth has shown signs of recovery.
Although inflation is still below the central bank’s annual target of 2%, central bank policymakers say the main reason for this is the temporary impact of the much lower oil price.
The economy "sees higher interest rates and needs them, given the tight labour market situation", says Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world were shaken last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by up to 16 percent from its May record, as investors feared China’s slowing economy would also slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now nearly 10 percent below its May peak.
For central bank decision-makers, market turmoil is an additional factor in the complex equation of when interest rates should be raised.
“Without these financial market events and the recent news coverage of China’s economic weakness, policymakers would be raising the bar at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior researcher at UCLA’s Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former central bank official.
Now he predicts that policymakers will wait at least a month to get a better understanding of the effects.
"The potential impact on the US economy is still very unclear and they have little information at their disposal about the consequences of what is happening in China," Oliner said.
The welfare of the international economy is not the central bank’s main concern, so in principle it should not influence decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Reserve has become the world’s monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the Central Bank has been enormous.
In 2013, then-chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, hinting that the central bank could “narrow” the increase in money supply caused upheavals in markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, central bank officials are expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The central bank’s decision-making process is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, global strategy manager for the asset management company Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that “the central bank has previously overreacted to a financial market movement that appears to be disconnected from economic fundamentals.”
The decision-making Federal Open Market Committee has called for an increase in the interest rate, and Lacker, a member of the committee with the right to vote, cites the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The Asian economic crisis caused the central bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage points during three meetings “despite its limited, identifiable impact on U.S. economic growth,” Lacker says.
A year later, the central bank reversed these cuts.
The central bank should only prioritize financial stability during a major crisis, such as when markets collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s rate-setting committee.
The latest upheaval does not come close to its level, Posen says.
“No one wants to see a situation where people are afraid of raising interest rates because the market is upset,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a double requirement and does not mention financial stability, and as long as that is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

Brazilian pediatrics organization Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet for breastfeeding
SPRS, Brazil’s children’s health organization, has come up with a shocking way to try to make women understand the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking on breasts painted with descriptions of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that provide babies with all the necessary nutrients for the development of a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that increasing calorie intake isn’t the only dietary change that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, revealed that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects the genetic expression of their babies and protects babies from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to negatively affect the child’s immune system.
Seven Channel's Sunrise Program Is Favorite in Viewer Counts, Despite Nine Channel's Attempts to Report a Leader Disclosure on Today's Show
The rush of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to report the aftermath of the Liberal Party leader’s revelation failed to increase Today’s attendance.
The Nine morning show aired from the nation's capital after Malcolm Turnbull deposed Tony Abbott.
The rival show Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international broadcasts covering Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The weight of the distance did not seem to bother Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise had an average audience of 397,000 in five state capitals, compared to 339,000 in Today.
Today’s average increased slightly compared to Monday’s (317,000) and last Tuesday’s (283,000), but it was still lower than last Thursday’s (343,000).
Today has captured Sunrise over the last few months.
In August, the average was 318,000 for Today and 330,000 for Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varied between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
So far in September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers, compared to 314,000 for Today.
This is the most interesting event of the morning.
The winds of change are blowing this morning not only in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are doing well, thank you for asking!
Posted by TODAY on Monday, September 14, 2015
The big news on Seven was the amazing premiere of 800 Words, featuring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama series, which gathered a fairly impressive average of 1,219 million viewers, tells the story of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the New Zealand coast with his two children.
Critics have wondered if Thomson could be the driving force behind the popular series without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The results of last night gave this a real certainty.
Seven's The X Factor was a strong favorite with 1.136 million viewers, easily winning The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had a double fate on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17-17.30) of the new quiz show hosted by Andrew O'Keefe attracted an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17.30-18) reached 623,000 viewers – enough for a small win on Eddie McGuire’s Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia had an average attendance of 520,000 for the first half-hour, and a staggering 720,000 for the second half-hour.
Hot Seat average was 620,000.
The Chase Australia’s drop in the second night’s attendance average gives Nine the confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular show at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute program, which failed to reduce McGuire's viewership.

The final three agree with their dads that Sam Wood is the perfect guy – but who will he pick?
The secret has been revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally revealed who will win The Bachelor.
The identity of the woman that Sam Wood ends up with in The Bachelor has been kept in the utmost secrecy.
The three remaining girls will not let up on who got the last rose.
However, in our conversation with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk, and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before the three became two, they could inadvertently give a hint of the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's final
All three women became poetic when they told him that Wood is the perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, when asked, “If Wood’s last rose isn’t for you, who should it go to?” their answers may have provided a clue as to who won the bachelor’s heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly cited Mackay as the best choice for Wood after them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been together since day one.
“From the moment I walked into the house, the energies of (Sarah’s) and Sam’s seemed quite compatible, and that thought was in my mind throughout the series,” Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is really down-to-earth, it's fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's chemistry between them.
They seem to be comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a good match.
Mackay said that last week's home visits made him realize that Wood could be "the one."
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game - I am now wholeheartedly involved in this," he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was enigmatic.
"I don't know if I can tell," he said.
I like the remaining girls just as much, so it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast Wednesday at 7.30 p.m. on Ten Channel.

Jarryd Hayne has many options for starting his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle were both quite interested in him after he moved to the United States, and many other teams have been asking about him since his impressive open practice day at the end of last year.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some of the coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game after this Australian rugby league pro-turn dropped the ball in his first airbrush return as the team beat Minnesota on Tuesday, 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and allowed Hayne to return the next air kick and took him to the running game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula’s true character was also visible in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of calling his new recruits a patsy in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at the post-game press conference.
The 49ers' special reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne Drops Flight Kick Captured by Minnesota Vikings in First Quarter
This certainly wasn’t the beginning that Hayne and his numerous Australian fans hoped for for a man’s NFL debut.
Hayne was seen swearing on the way from the pitch after the drop, and later told Australian radio couple Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM on 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"It's just one of those things, you just have to think about the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared his fumbling to his 2007 Origin debut when a pass in his own goal zone led to the Queensland goal.
All in all, it was a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed for a photo posted on her Instagram account with fans holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Russia’s richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at gunpoint on a Siberian airstrip.
Khodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was seized, and his efforts to support democracy were curtailed.
4 killed by police shooting rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a crowd protesting against the country’s new draft constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in the Rupandeh region about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
The region’s top official, Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, some of them throwing stones and firebombs.
Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to have killed, but which are traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, appeared to have caused so many deaths.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that their political influence will be undermined by the new provinces created under the proposed new constitution.
There have also been protests in western Nepal, with the Tharus group calling for a state of its own.
Since 10 August, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, including 11 police officers.
At that time, the four main parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has had a central government for centuries.
A new constitution has been planned since 2008, but lawmakers sped up the process after a devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
Legislators have this week voted on the clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and authorities have said that the new charter could be adopted by Sunday.
The National Hurricane Center NHC says there is a 60 percent chance of a hurricane south of Cape Verde
A wide low-pressure front, located about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde archipelago, has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
The second high-spec low-pressure front, located halfway between the Cape Verde archipelago and the Lesser Antilles, also has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone over the next two days, the weather forecast center in Miami added.
Google Launches Donation Campaign to Raise $11 Million for Refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) has launched a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations that help thousands of refugees in Europe flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal perspective when it published the donation campaign on its blog.
Instead of the announcement being made by the director, Google employee Rita Masoud, who fled Kabul with her family at the age of seven, wrote about her own personal experience.
“Our journey included numerous dark train and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness,” he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family are desperate to help.
The donations go to four non-profit organisations that help refugees and migrants: Médecins Sans Fronti<0xC3><0xA8>res, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it will match the same amount for every donation made to google.com/refugeerelief worldwide, up to $5.5 million, with a total goal of $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, mainly due to Syria’s four-year civil war, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many also flee war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery can help mildly obese diabetics
According to a new study, the benefits of weight loss surgery for people with mildly obese type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics will live longer after weight loss surgery than those treated by methods other than surgery.
“It takes a long time to get mortality data,” says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial for a new study in the journal JAMA Surgery.
In bariatric surgery, various methods are used to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been found to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the people in the study have been morbidly obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more.
A BMI, or weight-to-height ratio, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If your BMI is over 25, it indicates that you are overweight, and if your BMI is over 30, you are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery and gastric bypass surgery, to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of people who underwent surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, the BMI of people who were treated by means other than surgery remained roughly the same at 29.
Thirty-six percent of the people who had the surgery had a complete cure and 28 percent had a partial cure.
By comparison, in the medically treated group, diabetes was completely cured in only 1% and partially in about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, and the “bad” LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group,” the authors noted.
The researchers also monitored patients' blood haemoglobin A1c levels, which reflect blood sugar levels over the long term.
Hemoglobin A1c should remain below 7%, the researchers wrote.
Post-operative hemoglobin A1c levels fell from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the medical treatment group, it remained stable at around 8%.
However, this improved “glycemic control,” which is described by improved hemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce mortality over a five-year period, says lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research group also compared average results between two different types of surgery.
At the age of five, when compared to a group undergoing gastric bypass surgery, the group who had had gastric bypass surgery had lost more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), had decreased more than their BMI (7.4 and 5.1), had decreased more than their hemoglobin A1c levels (3.1% and 2.1%), and were more likely to have achieved complete remission (1.6%).
Blackstone of the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix says that while the study does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are research findings from Sweden where surgery led to longer lives for heavier people.
A Swedish study found that obese people who underwent weight loss surgery had a 29 percent lower chance of dying over a 15-year period when compared to a group who had tried more traditional treatments.
While the new study doesn’t show an improvement in surgical patient survival, Blackstone says the results are encouraging for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in surgery.
“The research results are crucial precisely because they show that surgery is safe for the lower BMI group,” with no increased risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously when the patient’s BMI is between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long before we take this seriously,” he says.
I believe that once a person has accumulated these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it will be very difficult to reverse the situation.
"Not everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to the violence in the refugees’ home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in a speech he gave at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the beginning of his ten-day visit to Britain, which is dedicated to research on ethics.
The Dalai Lama argued that, in the present situation, the needs of the whole of humanity should take precedence over the needs of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that, while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is also inadequate.
"Not everyone can come to Europe," he said.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the actions of Germany and Austria in the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
“It is wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime we have to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The bottom line is to think about how we can reduce killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In taking a stand on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush’s actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the violent response of the United States caused a chain of violent events.
"After the 9/11 attack, I sent a letter of condolence to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem lies in non-violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and it created unexpected consequences,” the Dalai Lama said.
Over the past four years, the ingestion of hand disinfectant by children has quadrupled.
Poison control centers across the United States have reported a nearly 400 percent increase in ingestion of highly alcoholic hand sanitizer in children under the age of 12 since 2010, according to the Poison Control Center in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Poison Information Center of Georgia, the rates of ingestion of disinfectant reported to poison information centers for children under the age of 12 increased from 3,266 cases in 2010 to 16,117 cases in 2014.
“Children are more often interested in these products, and unfortunately a certain percentage of them go to the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant on purpose, while others want to impress their friends or take up the challenge on social media.
There are videos on YouTube where teenagers drink disinfectant to get a cheap boost.
According to reports, teenagers have mixed disinfectant with alcohol-containing mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
Pleasant disinfectant scents can attract younger children.
"The child doesn't think that this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (hand sanitizers) are those to which the fragrance has been added.
There are disinfectants that smell of strawberries, grapes and oranges, which are very attractive to children.
A hand sanitizer can contain anything from 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, alcohol poisoning requires only a few injections.
“It’s really concentrated alcohol,” said Dr. Stephen Thornton, director of medical care at the University of Kansas Poison Control Center in Kansas City.
So please don’t leave the whiskey shot lying on the table, but the hand sanitizer is left exposed, and if kids are interested, it’s a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed only four sprays of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
His blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the adult limit for drunk driving, says Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated the girl at Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah mossed as he spoke and was unable to walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors followed her overnight in a separate children's hospital for possible brain injury symptoms, as alcohol made her fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"It was really scary," Nhaijah's mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant wipes and remove the disinfectant from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after ingesting a hand sanitizer containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
The health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a deadly substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was declared as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-graders in upstate New York planned to poison their “evil” teacher by spreading a bacterium to the classroom, police said in a report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand sanitizer and banned it from his class.
The police consider the plan to be “a blatant nonsense” and leave disciplinary measures to the school district.
Rumour mill: Celtic has no contradictions
Griffiths dismisses talk of Celtic's contradictions, and Deila admits that Hoops is in a tight spot, but she makes it turn around.
The Hearts are fighting the Scottish Football Association over Neilson’s charges, and Warburton is on the alert for January’s recruitments that could disrupt the team’s unity
Dons upped his lead to Celtic by five points
Adam Rooney's first-half penalty shot led Aberdeen to a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium and allowed the team to increase the gap with Celtic to five points.
Griffiths dismisses talk of contradictions
Rumors of Celtic's internal conflicts have sprung up, but Griffiths immediately overtook them. He claims that he and his teammates have no sense of working under closer scrutiny as the team prepares to face the Dutch league leader.
“I don’t think we’re under pressure, I think the players are waiting to meet.
The lack of a Scottish championship bores the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no rivalry for the title with the Rangers.
Ajax’s current ambassador, de Boer, said: “The highlights of the Celtic games are no longer being shown in the Netherlands and why?”
Because the Rangers aren't involved.
The people here are too tired to talk about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the Old Firm teams.
They’re talking about both teams together, and that’s what they’re interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the games of these teams, and also non-Scottish people want to follow those games.
Deila vows to turn things around
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn things around.
The loss to Malm<0xC3><0xB6>, and the subsequent knockout of the Champions League, was quickly followed by a loss to Aberdeen, who is now at the top of the league with a five-point gap to the next.
However, Deila said, “Celtic has had some bad episodes before, and we’re getting back up.”
Now all we want to do is get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know that this is frustrating and that a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
So are we, but we have to keep going.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of the players.
Now is the time to stay together.
Warburton warns of January transfer
While Rangers boss Mark Warburton commented just a few weeks ago on potential January transfer targets, he remains alert to the recruitment fervor, asserting he does not want to confuse the team with unanimity.
A former Brentford boss said: “The transfer window in January is very different from the summer window.”
For the players coming in the summer, the adjustment period is the entire pre-season period, which is reflected in our team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can do more harm.
Celtic's interest in Michu hints at retirement
Swansea forward Michu, whose name is linked to Celtic in the transfer window, has hinted he may retire after his contract with the Swans ends.
The 29-year-old has had ankle problems for two years and was unable to find a new club outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts is ready to fight the Scottish Football Association over Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team lost 3-2. The defender's red card was later rescinded, and this was the third red card to be rescinded by Collum in the last eight months.
Neilson stands by his statement, claiming, "I didn't question honesty, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The faithful Hibernian player was reprimanded for admitting to singing an insulting song about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in Roseburn, Edinburg, before the Edinburgh Derby at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a spur of the moment," he said, adding, "It's safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I go and play for Celtic."
The Tannadice government believes in Dundee United's leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United board still has faith in the management team's ability to turn things around, but admits that the weakening of the players must stop.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're going to get the boys back in shape," Donnelly said.
McInnes delighted with 'ugly win' at Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately hanging in on the game against the Hamilton Accies, but thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty, he managed to score his seventh consecutive league win, which put them at the top of the table by five points above Celtic.
McInnes says, "There is no team that has won anything, be it a trophy or a league, that hasn't won games this way."
Scotland’s unemployment will remain the same as the UK’s total
Unemployment in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while unemployment in the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million.
Scotland’s unemployment rate is 5.9% higher than the UK’s 5.5%, according to figures from the National Statistics Office (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12 000 people over a three-month period, and the number of people in employment now stands at 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74 per cent over the quarter, which is higher than the UK average of 73.5%.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell commented on these latest figures: "The government's long-term plan is to build a stronger economy."
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of Great Britain.
During these 12 months, the Scottish labour market has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has fallen.
Why I'm Witnessing an Execution in Oklahoma
If there is no judicial intervention, later today I will watch the execution of the man.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in the audience gallery at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary watching Richard Glossip be executed by lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
I received the request in January through her best friend, and although I was upset, I agreed.
I've started to dread this day as it approaches.
So why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
Of course, journalists have the opportunity to follow executions in America, and since there are often more applications than seats available, the participants are selected through a gruesome lottery.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats allocated to the media from 12 to 5.
Whoever is chosen will look at the event in a cool way.
I can't do it.
I’ll be sitting next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends, and I’ve also made contact with him through the phone calls I’ve made over the months and one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like him.
We often laugh when we talk.
Prison officials say I can't be both a witness and a reporter, so I'm not allowed to carry a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist in Oklahoma accused me of compromising my neutrality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants to, and you'll be a part of it.
I complained to the reporter.
The wedding admitted that "it could have been arranged better", but still thinks that what I am doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it if he did.
I've told him that he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to be present to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help the anti-death penalty movement.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is by my side.
If you want to know more about the story, you can listen to a series of podcasts I made.
I am not going to go over all the details again.
I can't say with any certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would make him guilty of aiding and abetting anyway.
But I think there's a very strong possibility that he wasn't guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think it's wrong to execute him.
And that’s the point of view from which I see him dying.
I cannot claim to be completely impartial.
There will be other journalists there to take care of it.
I will give you a description of what it feels like to watch a man I like die needlessly.
Man lured out of Canning River after police chase
Canning Vale's officer stayed dry when he lured him out of the Canning River.
A Perth man’s attempt to distract the police failed when he found himself in shallow, muddy water just meters away from a policeman who tried to “gently lure him back to shore.”
Canning Vale police were called to Beckenham on Tuesday for trespassing.
When they spotted the suspect, he tried to distract them by diverting them to the Canning River.
But he did not get very far.
"He was standing in the water saying, 'I'm not coming out, come and get me,'" said Shandell Castledine, a senior sergeant.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to get wet, so he used a safer tactic: "a proper police conference."
“Sometimes people do funny things when they’re trying to escape,” said Sgt. Castledine, a senior sergeant.
Champion footballer Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid being blown up and attempted to swim across the Swan River.
He failed in his attempt, but inspired the locals to start designing the playful Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody Claims Officials Tried to Spy on Him and Threatens to Stop Competing
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria officials tried to infiltrate his stables last year, threatening to stop racing immediately.
He accuses the officials and the integrity division of Racing Victoria, claiming that they have a personal campaign going on against him. On Wednesday, Lady Tatai's late rejection due to a medical procedure on the day of the race was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what’s best for the competition, and that he’s been in a difficult situation since Lidar’s unexplained positive cobalt sample.
He has kept his tongue in check on spy claims for a year and a half and didn’t want it to “look like envy.”
“I wasn’t going to say anything about this, and I’ve been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so frustrating that everything unravels at once,” Moody said.
They knew the situation would continue.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I've said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm going to sleep well.
I want to walk with my head held high and I want the owners to think that I’m doing the best I can for them.
“When they start to think differently, then I don’t have to continue as a coach.
Then I would have to consider what to do with my license.
Moody previously dropped a bombshell in an interview with racing.com in which he said the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
“A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man — I’ll name him when asked — and offered him a job at my stables if he passed on information about what I’m doing there.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, I'm sure they should fire their lawyers because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, the former president of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, the current president of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of the issue at the time and are aware of it today.
Am I supposed to start thinking this is getting personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to man up and perhaps pass on responsibility for what is happening in the industry to more than just the coaches?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people think so.
Perhaps they will have to take my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that what I am saying now will perhaps make them think just that.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, and it saddens me.
It really saddens me.
I urge them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach’s frustration has increased with long-term research on Lidar’s cobalt, and his late rejection led him to conclude that he could “throw his license over the table.”
Moody, best known for coaching the undefeated champion Black Caviar, has called the rule of race day management “ridiculous” after putting a mud or clay bath on a horse’s legs, which is illegal.
“It’s against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for that,” he said.
One of my employees accidentally put mud on it.
It could have had a grave last night.
It could have been yesterday, as it was.
He had it on race day.
Moody may face a three-month ban due to the competition day’s brood care, which the officials launched an investigation into.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Driver Arrested in Cobram
Police have arrested a man who ran into a cyclist in Cobram over the weekend.
The cyclist was taken by air to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after suffering serious injuries when he was hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver drove off and did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Natalia reported himself to the police in Shepparton.
He will be charged with failing to stop in an accident, failing to provide assistance, and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in hospital and in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy attacks rivals over allegations
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticized the two NRL rugby league champions' claims that his team's tackles were part of a "lineup".
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm to "wrestle" on his side when he unexpectedly won the final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely managed to hide his reference to Storm after winning the North Queensland Cowboys in the final qualifier on Saturday night. Bennett called the game a "showcase window" of the rugby league and said the two Queensland teams were not "excited" about the wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's tackles and said they only focus on "contact" when tackling.
Bellamy added that his confidence was boosted by criticism of Storm by the two leading coaches, which means they fear losing to the team.
"This always comes up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about wrestling when we lost to them 24-2," Bellamy said.
I can assure you that we have not changed anything in our defence systems or technologies throughout the year, but in the last six weeks we have only emphasized contact in tackles, and that has made us successful.
Trent has been on the team for three years and obviously has a great team to coach, so he’s probably not used to losing and this was a bit of a shock for him.
Funny how it always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting rugby" by reminding his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing "boringly".
Wayne talks about exciting rugby.
He felt it was important to compare his Saturday night game to our Friday night game and tell us how exciting their game was,” Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn’t care less.
But now he has a team that can play the kind of rugby that we find exciting, especially when he has fast young guys.
That’s the kind of game you want to play when you have that type of player.
He brought that up in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby – not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play that way.
I get more confident when they say things like that because they’re a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as a resistance to important games.
Bellamy also noted that the game between the Storm and the Roosters was more scoring than the game between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was certainly a good game, I haven’t watched it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two goals more, but is it exciting rugby?
Or does it make it exciting to break the line of defense and not score a goal?
For me, this is about policy.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can play against them.
Storm has this weekend off as they have already won the home game against either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks for next Saturday night’s pre-final at AAMI Park. Tickets will go on sale next Tuesday morning.
Serbian man granted $200,000 in drug charges
A man threatened with life imprisonment for attempted possession of 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, is one of five men arrested last month after federal police traced 100 pounds of the drug to Solay, a yacht that came to South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maximovic was seen meeting other defendants at the marina all morning, and then met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of drugs in a Toyota Echo car.
Although Maksimovic is threatened with a possible life sentence for attempting to hold a commercial quantity of cocaine, his lawyer claimed that there is no evidence that Maksimovic attempted to hold the entire quantity and that he may have been in a café for entirely innocent reasons.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maksimovic was trying to escape.
"He has close ties with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal court case, Maksimovic lied to the police about the place where he lived.
Maximovic’s mother and stepfather had jointly offered $200,000 in bail to secure his release.
"After reading the affidavits of both individuals, it is clear that the imposition of a $200,000 bail is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
But that alone was not enough to prevent him from appearing in court, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted guarantees on condition that he surrenders both his Australian and Serbian passports, reports to the police daily and adheres to his curfew between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to lure pedophiles into sending pictures
A paedophile used an 11-year-old girl’s phone to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took this phone while the girl was sleeping and then logged into an online communication service, where Hogg received numerous obscene pictures of the children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up, noticed that the phone was missing, and found it in Hogg's sleeping hand.
The girl searched her phone and found shocking messages, after which she immediately told her mother.
When the police arrived, they saw five pictures, searched the computers present and found “worrying” web searches with keywords that had been used to search for obscene pictures of children.
Hogg then told police that he had done this to "attract pedophiles" on the Internet before "pretending to be a police officer to scare them".
Fiscal Deputy Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he had done the searches on the computer but said that they were done only because he wanted to pretend to be a policeman in order to scare off pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with an unknown person who sent him the pictures, and about Hogg asking the person to send him additional pictures.
Hogg said he only did this for decoy purposes.
He said he's sick after drinking, and he wants to look at pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: “When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she screamed at her mother, shaking and crying.
She saw the obscene pictures on the phone and then confronted the accused.
The girl was interviewed and told that the accused had used a computer and a Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
The 23-year-old Hogg, who lives on Ward Road in Dundee, pleaded guilty on 14 June last year to making or taking pictures of promiscuous children, breached his bail on 25 January this year and did not appear in court on 24 March this year.
His lawyer, Gregor Sim, asked that Hogg not be registered as a sex offender, as it could be argued that his crime did not have a "significant sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the sentence until October to give social services time to prepare background reports.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but in other pending cases, he's in custody before trial.
He was added to the sex offenders register before the day of sentencing.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe delivers wrong speech to parliament
Africa’s oldest leader, Mugabe, fell on the steps leading to the podium earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video of the crash spread like a virus on social media.
Parliament's inauguration was also marred by claims by opposition lawmakers that anonymous death threats had been sent to them warning them not to boo Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they booed and interrupted him with interjections as he gave a state of the country speech to Parliament - which he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) group’s spokesman, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to disturb Mugabe’s speech.
"The number from which the message was sent is not responsible, but the message is headed 'death'," she told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned the Members concerned that immunity would end in Parliament and that when they step out, parliamentary immunity would not apply.
A group discipline supervisor said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is “worried” about threats against its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in the business services business.
Later this year, HP will split into two publicly traded companies, separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing enterprise hardware and services operations.
Expected job cuts will cost about $2.7 billion, starting in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring efforts will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP President and CEO, who will lead the division after the split.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than today’s HP, and we will have a broad and deep range of services to help companies transition to a new kind of business,” Whitman said.
As a stand-alone company, our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have more than $50 billion in annual revenue and will “focus on delivering unparalleled integrated technology solutions” for businesses, the company said in a statement.
The division disintegrates a company that was founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical goods in a garage in Palo Alto called "The Birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has gone through a massive reorganization to survive the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the world’s second largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, and its division is the latest in an industry based on the belief that tightly constrained companies perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must support injured Jack Wilshere before a draw with Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is only September and assuming that his rehabilitation is going as planned, there is no reason why he should not be playing again by Christmas.
At best, Wilshire will miss at least the next four games in England and, given his background, it is uncertain whether he will take part in the European Championships next summer.
The biggest pity about this latest problem is that Wilshere’s last season’s ending was strong after a single ankle injury, and he remembered his old sharpness before the season started.
"This kind of injury doesn't threaten a career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or any previous injuries he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted, when a player tries to return mid-season, there is always a risk of further injury.
There is also an uncomfortable pattern.
Research by Premier Injuries Ltd shows that Wilshere has suffered 23 different injuries since his debut six years ago.
He has also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the past five seasons.
Looking at the wider Arsenal scene since the 2007-08 season, in six out of eight seasons, it has been one of the Premier League teams that has lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger admits the possibility of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe their last season’s improvement in injury statistics will continue.
"Sometimes when you're recovering from an injury, it can be a vulnerable period where you need to strengthen your body and get some competition," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I’m sure it will, and that he will get the career he deserves.
Wenger is gearing up to turn his team around as Arsenal start their Champions League match against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday night, then against Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday.
Héctor Beller<0xC3><0xAD>n and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be in the beginning.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud with Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to maintain balance and give a breather to the players who need it," Wenger said.
Despite Arsenal being a clear favourite in Group F, Maximir’s stadium in Zagreb is one of the most intimidating in Europe.
Dinamo have also not lost in 41 games since producing their own “Invincible” campaign last season.
On Tuesday night, the stadium was rocked by an earthquake with a magnitude of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal have learned the lessons of last season’s Champions League capitulation against Monaco and is still motivated by a distant dream of leading the team to its first European Cup victory.
"This motivation is huge," Wenger said.
Arsenal have never achieved that.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I can be realistic.
We are ambitious, but not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about male friendship
It is striking how similar descriptions do not exist in the series, especially considering that the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rate of young men is higher than in fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and is three times more common among men than women.
In an effort to tackle the problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as Men’s Year. The goal was to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
A recent study involving more than 2,000 high school and high school students who showed symptoms of depression found that a person's chance of recovery doubled if a high enough percentage of his friends were "healthy."
Similarly, for those who were not depressed, the likelihood of mental health problems occurring was halved if they had mentally healthy friends.
But for a friendship to work, it must first be available.
In this time of communication through social media, style goes beyond content, and the immediacy of the response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, happy, and successful, when in reality, isolation reigns.
This superficial success is dominated by values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All this is done at the expense of internal values - inner longing for personal growth and friendship - that have a deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a billionaire video game developer recently explained, money can’t really make you happier.
The beauty of friends was that it turned this focus on its head.
Not a single character was defined by their work, but rather by their personality, which stood out in the interaction as friends.
Joey and Chandler’s numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs watching football, Ross missing Rachel—their sense of humor came from knowing that yes, men can relate to all of this, even though they often hesitate to fully explore their emotions.
As a Samaritans volunteer explained to me: “Listening to people who are depressed and suicidal, I have really understood how even the slightest interaction with a friend can make you feel better.”
Often, the men who contact us feel that they cannot talk to friends.
The old idea of “getting over” is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up to problems, you see them as weak.
Friends is one of those series that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term survival options.
It emphasized the small moments of friendship between men.
While my neutral, off-the-shelf position on the other end of the phone helps people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you’re attending Comedy Central’s FriendsFest this weekend, and all the locations have been redesigned to celebrate the occasion, why not take your friends for a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone lonely at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, attend #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG slap Malm<0xC3><0xB6> to the side
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavani against Malm<0xC3><0xB6>.
Angel Di Maria scored in his Champions League debut, helping PSG overtake the Swedish club Malm<0xC3><0xB6> on Tuesday.
Match report and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started their Champions League game with a nice 2-0 win over Malm<0xC3><0xB6> at Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria made his Champions League debut in less than four minutes, showing the way to the French league champions, but the team lost several chances before finally increasing their lead as Cavan scored in the 61st minute.
Paris, who is in Group A with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champion, as there was not only an extra spot in the game, but also an improvement in their games leading to the quarter-finals in the last three rounds.
But even though PSG took the points, it was not a classic game, as Laurent Blanc's team Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost a spot in front of the goal and was later changed from the pitch. Malm<0xC3><0xB6> is his old hometown team and the team where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win in the Champions League at home or away, so a 2-0 win is a problem for the opponent and looks good in the statistics, and it’s a good start, even if there are things we have to work on this season,” Blanc said.
This foreshadows a good thing.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we did not manage to score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisian team after an injury in one of the three changes made after the team missed a 2-2 draw in Ligue 1 home game against Bordeaux over the weekend, but was left in Di Maria's shadow in the fourth minute.
When he left Manchester United last month, the Argentine winger was named the man who will take PSG to the next level in Europe, and he proved why when he ran Marco Verratt’s pitch behind the Malm<0xC3><0xB6> line of defense and then struck a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland in the back corner of the net.
However, if anyone expected an easy and big win from PSG, they were disappointed.
Malm<0xC3><0xB6> was a stagnant opponent, winning Celtic's decision to reach this level, with nine international players and a five-man defence, and two players in the deep midfield.
But on the offensive side, the team offered little more than Nikola Djurdjic's shot in the 34th minute, which went just past the goalpost of Kevin Trapp.
On the other hand, PSG got into trouble sometimes due to missed passes and poor finishing, especially from Ibrahimovic, who failed in five attempts in the first half and was disappointed when Cavani put the ball in at Ibrahimovic's touch at the beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more efficient in pre-work with his colleagues, and it was Ibrahimovic's pitch that Di Maria sent a round kick around Wiland's goal post at the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour of play, thanks to Cavani, who scored his sixth goal of the season, after Ibrahimovic had knocked forward Maxwell's cross ball from the left.
That ended Malm<0xC3><0xB6>'s hopes of getting back in the game, and only Wiland's brilliant rejection of David Luiz's direct kick kept the final numbers down before Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal from the substitution was abandoned at the very end of the game.
Malm<0xC3><0xB6> coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were at the same level as his team. The Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was last December last year."
Since then we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
The qualifiers are not enough.
Hats off to Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore Raises $2.5 Billion to Sell Shares
The Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, which suffered from a collapse in commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its vast debt-cutting plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a statement that it had sold up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion in new shares to reduce its debt.
The company, which lost 57% of its market value this year, is struggling with collapsed commodity prices as the slowdown in the Chinese economy strains demand and wreaks havoc on all markets.
The rights issue put Glencore’s stock price at the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday mornings.
Stocks rose 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence in the FTSE 100 index, opening 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had revealed last week a $2.5 billion stock deal as part of a broader plan to cut its $30 billion debt burden by about a third.
The company sold the new share capital for 125 pence, which meant a 2.4% discount on Tuesday’s closing price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares worth 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about China’s prolonged stagnation of growth have cut iron ore prices by about half, while at the same time the prices of coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, a statement released by the White House on Tuesday confirmed.
Xi’s first official visit to Washington will take place on September 25 and is a response to President Barack Obama’s visit to Beijing last November, the statement said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will host a dinner for Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan after the leaders have held bilateral talks.
“The visit of President Xi will provide an opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a wide range of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while at the same time enabling President Obama and President Xi to have a constructive discussion on issues of disagreement,” the statement added.
During the visit, which was first announced in February, Xi is also expected to depart for Seattle on his trip to Washington, D.C., to meet with a number of U.S. technology leaders before moving on to New York City and the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to discuss a number of controversial topics, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyber espionage and the country’s increased insistence on the South China Sea’s controversial waters.
Matt Damon makes a difference in filmmaking.
Matt Damon clashed with African-American filmmaker Effie Brown as they discussed a difference that Damon said was not needed behind the scenes.
On HBO’s Sunday night episode of Project Greenlight, the seasoned actor interrupted Brown as he stressed the need for different perspectives on the black protagonist of the screenplay selected for the project.
“When we talk about difference, it’s taken into account when choosing actors for a movie, not a series,” Damon said.
Shocked, Brown reacted with incredulity to the injured, commenting "Ooh! Wow. Okay," while the comments of the Martian actor were left hanging in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the show's finalists.
“I want to encourage people to think, no matter who the director is, how they treat Harmony’s character,” Brown said.
The only dark character is a whore who is beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of The Dear White People demanded the film’s directing rights for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon responded bluntly that their direction “could end up giving us something we don’t want.”
After the conversation was posted, social media exploded to disapprove of Damon’s comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed anger at the clip, writing, "Matt Damon talking to the only black person in the room and explaining the difference is SO WHITE that it hurts."
Since its release, it has received over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon’s comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After white police killed teenage Michael Brown in 2014, The Black Lives Matter movement spread nationwide and urged lawmakers and authorities to end discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince referred to the movement when presenting Album of the Year nominees for the Grammy Award.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
Black Lives Matter leaders recently released a statement in response to Fox News television star Elisabeth Hasselbeck’s question about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
“The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group,” the leaders said.
It was recently reported that Damon is among entertainers, producers and media moguls who have been invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he accepted the invitation or had already met the pope.
First American Ninja Warrior Champion to be crowned
On Monday, professional rock climber and tableware collector Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition and was rewarded with a million-dollar grand prize.
At the very end of its seventh season, there has never been a competitor to overcome all the sections of the obstacle course of the programme.
In the final episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final round.
The final task required climbing a 23-metre rope in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and cleared the challenge in time, becoming the first athlete ever to solve the exhausting 4th leg of the American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero cleared the challenge three seconds faster, making him a winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after a hard-won win and was still shocked to win the million-dollar grand prize.
“So it’s great to think of this as I’ve never made or lived on more than $10,000 a year,” Isaac told E! after his big pay raise.
So all of a sudden... I can't even imagine what it's going to be like... the future is unknown.
Production director Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the fine print and why Britten doesn’t get more reward money when he’s the first racer ever to get through the track.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If more people pass, the money gets to the one who has the fastest time," Weed said.
While money is a great reward and a life-changing one, she still gets a great sense of satisfaction.
I don't think he feels bad about it.
He’s just so happy that he did what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy and a good family man.
He is a hero to his wife and children.
Geoff told me, “If anyone had to beat me, I’m glad it was Isaac.”
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if this had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior returns for its eighth season starting in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past the Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season hasn't been very fun for the Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers were once one of the best baseball teams, but are now the last in the American League Central Division.
The Tigers played their spoiler role perfectly Tuesday when they beat the Minnesota Twins at 5-4 Target Field.
The Twins lost a chance to reach one-half of the Houston Astros in a contest for another wild card position in the American League.
For Detroit, the game was a return to the six-letter "H" word for at least one night, which had been very hard to reach for most of the second half of the season.
“All wins are fun, no matter how you get them,” said Tigers team principal Brad Ausmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon continued his early offensive support when Detroit ran three times in the first two innings, and then once in the sixth and once again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 innings and released three runs.
This was his third appearance in the last nine games.
“I just want a strong end to this year,” Simon said.
It's hard for an alternate to pitch every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers substitute Victor Martinez hit three times and made it possible for him to have two runs, his first since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-hit night since he hit four times against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He waved the bat well," Ausmus said.
He looked good (in batting practice), looked significantly better in bating practice, and continued to do the same in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the second half of the seventh inning, and that was their best chance of getting back in the game.
Centre Byron Buxton started the inning by hitting out twice on the left field line.
On the right-hand side, Aaron Hicks made his way home with the snap of one of the hives, and Simon was able to burn second-base player Brian Dozier directly before Simon was replaced by the left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player to stand out, ahead of Miguel Sano, who pulled two bases to the left of Drew VerHagen.
With two runners on the pitch and a handicapter on second base, VerHagen got third baseman Trevor Plouffe to score a double-header.
It was the 27th time this season that Plouffe has won a double game.
After Detroit had finished the defensive run in the ninth inning, Mauer ran two runs against the Tigers' closing Bruce Rondon, and the score was 5–4.
However, the right-handed player burned Sano in three passes in his fifth save.
In the beginning, Detroit took advantage of the rusty Phil Hughes.
The Tigers had three runs in the first two innings against a right-handed veteran player who was removed from the injured list before the game after more than a month due to lower back infection.
“It’s obvious I didn’t want this kind of start,” Hughes said, “but as the game progressed I felt more comfortable, and I felt like I could make some nice passes in the third inning.”
After Hughes caught the starter on first base, he allowed second base player Ian Kinsler to advance one by one.
The right wing's J.D. Martinez's walk in a two-burn situation brought Victor Martinez to bat, who took himself to first base with a midfield shot and caused the game's first run.
Victor Martinez broke his 0-21 streak with the runners in good running positions.
Third-base player Nick Castellanos continued by hitting the right and causing a second run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was disqualified as he attempted to advance to third-base.
The Tigers continued in the second innings and got one touchdown, two runs from James McCann and two runs, one run from Anthony Gose, after which the score was 3-0.
"It was an important shot," Twins team principal Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit very well, but it flew to the right spot.
Hughes started to pass the ball and passed a third inning without a run, and was replaced by right-handed successor A.J. Achter.
Hughes was counted three runs out of six strokes and walked four fires.
ATTENTION: Tigers right-handed pitcher Anibal Sanchez got away due to a sprained shoulder in his throwing arm.
He is being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list since mid-August due to a shoulder sprain, but was due to return on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is out, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris comes out of the injured list to take on the Twins.
Norris's record in the Tigers is 1-1 in four starts since left-handed pitcher David Price was traded to him on July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20th due to a straining of his right oblique abs.
The Tigers and Twins three-game series ends Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) takes on Minnesota right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for wider opening of the economy to the world
The economy needs to open up more to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with steering the reform.
“China should commit to attract foreign funding and expertise and develop a policy of transparency,” he said, speaking at the 16th meeting of the group leading the deepening of the overall reform.
Supporting openness at the same time as reforms are being pushed forward will create new movement and vitality, and create new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list limiting market access, a relaxation of the principles of border control, an invitation to state-owned enterprises to seize private capital, and a revision of the residents’ registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list will be created, identifying the sectors and companies in which it is not allowed to invest.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through pilot programmes.
The change is significant as it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensures a legal business environment and makes the market more transparent.
The government also loosens its control over the power it allocates to companies, thus ensuring that companies decide for themselves how to run their business.
China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation as well as new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
In order to open up state-controlled sectors to private financiers, more sectors will open up.
“The government will not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services,” the statement said.
In addition, the application process for permanent resident permits for foreigners, "green cards", is facilitated by optimizing the requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guaranteeing of the right to practise the profession of lawyer and support for professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement released after the meeting.
