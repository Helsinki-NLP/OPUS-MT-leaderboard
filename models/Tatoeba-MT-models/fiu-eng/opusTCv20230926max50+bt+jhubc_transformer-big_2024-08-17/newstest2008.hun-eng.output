European inflation slumped on food
The acceleration of inflation in the euro area is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
The price increase in November was higher than expected in the 13 countries of the euro area, with annual inflation of 3.1 percent after 2.6% in October, the European Union’s statistical office reported.
The official forecast is only 3 percent, according to Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the US, British and Canadian central banks, has not cut the base rate, saying that the reduction, together with rising commodity prices and easing unemployment, would lead to an inflation spiral.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but close to, 2%.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in its 22nd trap: “we need to talk down” inflation so that it does not have to act on this issue later.
In Germany, the November inflation rate of 3.3 percent is a 12-year record; in Spain, it rose to 4.1 percent from 3.6 percent.
Inflation in the euro area has been driven to high levels by rising food and energy prices.
Futures prices for wheat have risen by 88 percent, and soy prices have also reached their highest level since 1973.
There was also a substantial increase in the price of oil and dairy products in 2007.
The price of oil on the world market has increased by 52 percent this year, and last month it cost almost $100 a barrel of black gold.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.5 per cent in 2008, but will fall to 1.9 per cent in 2009.
Analysts say the 12-month inflation rate will remain around 3 percent over the next 3-4 months, but the annual average rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, it is expected that the ECB has twice lowered interest rates during 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
After a long period of stagnation, Fidesz’s support has grown significantly by the beginning of December, so it now has the largest camp since 2002, while Gallup has never measured such low support for socialists at 13 percent.
In the case of certain party voters, the difference would mean more than two-thirds (71 percent) support against one-fifth (20 percent) support for MSZP due to the greater determination of the opposition voters.
According to the survey, the MDF and the SZDSZ are below the parliamentary threshold: their support within the total population is two percent.
Supporters in both camps are one percent more likely to vote.
The general economic mood, capable of reaching the previous low, has deteriorated further – never before has the proportion been so high, 41% of those who considered the country’s economic situation specifically very bad, while another 46% think the situation is quite bad.
After the more hopeful prospects of spring and summer, families are now again more pessimistic about the changes in their own financial situation.
For the next year, a larger half of the population expects further deterioration and only a tenth improvement.
In December, more people than in any previous Gallup poll, 71 percent, believed that the prime minister was doing his job poorly than well.
In Ferenc Gyurcsány, 13 percent of the respondents trust or very much trust, while in Viktor Orbán, 38 percent of the respondents are supporters.
54 per cent do not trust the prime minister at all, while 27 per cent do not trust the president of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the political situation is how much of society thinks that it is possible to deal with dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister without a change of government.
While after the riots in October last year, 35 per cent considered it desirable for the government and the Prime Minister to remain, at present this rate is only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) see the solution only in calling new elections.
Typical of the interest in the referendum, 60 percent of the respondents answered that they would definitely leave, and another 20 percent said that they would probably leave.
By way of comparison, only 55 percent would be certain to participate in a “parliamentary election this Sunday” and an additional 15 percent would consider their participation likely.
74 percent would say no to tuition, 79 percent would say no to visits, and 84 percent would say no to hospital fees.
If we look at the same proportions only among those who promise their participation in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of the voters would reject the introduction of tuition fees, visitation fees and hospital daily allowances.
The most expensive is Auchan, Tesco raised by almost a fifth
In the Buda<0xC3><0xB6>rs retail triangle, hypermarkets kept the average price level increase of 16 percent last year, with the difference that VAT did not rise this year.
The Daily Economy article
The usual Christmas basket of the Daily increased by an average of 16 percent in the Buda<0xC3><0xB6>rs trade triangle this year again, but in all hypermarkets the increase in value was well over a thousand forints.
As last December, prices in grocery stores were already “slowing down”, so compared to the previous high base, there was no drastic increase in price.
But it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they could get last year for well under nine thousand forints, they cannot get for even ten thousand forints now.
The Daily’s basket crossed the ten-thousand-forint psychological limit in the hypermarkets under investigation by at least 91 forints.
The highest basket value was HUF 10,573.
(In 2003, the basket cost 6,800 forints.)
The price of Unicum and live fish remained almost at the same level as last year, but the price of turkey breast fillet, nuts and poppy seed also increased strongly.
The prices of flour and bread followed the data of the HCSO, although we found a kilogram of bread in Auchan for 139 forints.
The competition did not push the price of the product below 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of the two-liter bottle of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so they charged only 257 forints for the product, including the deposit fee.
However, this year Auchan was the most expensive in the Daily basket, while Cora was the cheapest.
Compared to last year’s Christmas prices, Cora increased by 15 percent, while Tesco and Auchan increased the prices in the Daily’s basket by 18-18 percent.
Compared to last year’s most expensive and this year’s cheapest basket value, the difference was 12 percent, while last year’s cheapest and this year’s most expensive basket value grew by 21 percent.
The average increase in forint was 1480.
Last year, the average price increase came to HUF 1,206, so that last Christmas the VAT increase had an impact on prices.
It was precisely this process that disrupted trade, and apparently the stores were unable to decide how much margin to apply to a product, as they were unable to calculate the effect that price changes would have on consumption.
(If the turnover rate of a product is wrongly planned by the trader, then a significant profit can be made on the margin adjusted to traffic intensity.)
Due to VAT, the price increase of the Daily’s basket last year was so extreme that the most expensive basket was HUF 1,720 more than in 2006, while the price difference at the cheapest basket was only HUF 844.
This year, this extreme did not show itself, as the most expensive one this year was HUF 1630 more than last year, and the cheapest one also became more expensive by HUF 1284.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price increase, in less than 20 months, daily consumer goods became more than 30 percent more expensive in hypermarkets.
(By the way, this does not necessarily confirm the data of the HCSO: for some basic foods, the Statistical Office recorded a price increase of more than 30 percent over a period of 12 months.
For example, in the case of eggs.)
According to Napi’s basket, this seems almost impossible for the latter, since the price level of the already quite expensive product last year produced a price increase of barely over 10 percent compared to the base in the worst case.
The flour suppliers seem to be in a stronger position than the egg-suppliers, and they managed to cheat the multinationals of the drastic increase in the price level.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypers do not complain, they constantly report a good year.
In our experience, in the three stores we visited, the majority of customers are no longer interested in prices.
They buy a lot of everything, they take away the durable food.
On Wednesday morning, serious queues were formed in front of the cash desks in all three stores, because the number of visitors suddenly increased.
However, we know that there is less traffic in the countryside, and many people complain to research companies that they are not even planning to generate revenue, not only for food, but also for durable consumer goods.
They save on disinfectants in many places
This year, more than a thousand infections have been recorded in hospitals, mainly due to improper use of antibiotics.
Hygiene conditions in hospitals, bed-crowding, and staff overload are not conducive to stopping infections, according to the chief medical officer of the National Center for Epidemiology.
They also save on disinfectants in many places.
Recently, I was diagnosed with MRSA at the traumatology department of the János Hospital.
A man who was admitted after a serious accident was found to have bacteria resistant to antibiotics.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred earlier this year.
The victim of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but soon after, he had to return home with an MRSA infection, and an important surgery has not yet been performed because of the bacteria in his body.
By December 10, 1,094 hospital-acquired infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens had been reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz, head of department at the National Center for Epidemiology.
This means that infections caused by so many multi-resistant pathogens have certainly been registered in hospitals, the rest is unknown.
About two-thirds (683 infections) of the infections were caused by MRSA, a type of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is carried in the nose by one-third of people without causing the disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. pharyngitis, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) respond well to antibiotics and are curable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, a bacteria that responds well to antibiotics will develop into a highly antibiotic-resistant bacterium, which will spread rapidly in inappropriate hospital settings.
In particular, if the immune system is temporarily or permanently impaired, it can cause serious hospital-acquired infections, such as wound infections or sepsis, in patients with a weakened body, the elderly or low body weight.
According to the medical director of the János Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, such infections are part of the daily practice of hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is just not there, said Tibor Nyulasi, where the presence of the pathogen is not tested.
Resistant to antibiotics
“Such patients are isolated, the nursing staff provides the patient with rubber gloves and masks, and we have the right antibiotics for their treatment,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients who are admitted to the hospital will be tested for MRSA in the first place, but it is not always possible to avoid infection.
Sampling is not fashionable
The vast majority of hospital-acquired infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current domestic hospital conditions are not favourable for preventing the development and spread of multi-resistant pathogens, Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz says.
As this infection typically occurs in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should monitor incoming patients and isolate MRSA-carrying patients immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not in vogue in Hungarian hospitals.
The National Health Insurance Fund does not fund these tests.
Most cases will come to light if the patient has a detectable MRSA infection, said the chief physician of the epidemiology center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent the development of resistance to medicines, but this is not always the case in hospitals.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in outpatient and primary care, Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz said.
They save on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most often transmitted from one patient to another through the mediation of medical personnel.
Therefore, hand washing, the use of gloves, masks play a very large role, but there are also significant shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is spread by contact, but in domestic hospital conditions it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, the wards are often crowded, and the beds are often very close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 metres apart.
Unfortunately, Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz noted that hospitals in a poor financial situation save on disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients, so the chances of developing infections are even higher.
According to Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz, where the appropriate precautions are taken, there is less evidence of such an infection or the spread of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government Programme against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA is a huge expense for health insurers, and they are fighting it everywhere.
In England, for example, the government programme included the prevention and reduction of the incidence of MRSA.
The programme seems to have been successful, and according to the data provided, MRSA infections are on a declining trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) includes among its priorities the prevention of the development of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and hospital-acquired infections caused by such pathogens.
The police officer who caused the accident was not drunk.
The official expert opinion has been prepared in the case of the fatal accident caused by the police captain of the XXII. district.
There is no way that the intoxicated or intoxicated police captain who resigned his position in the meantime, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday, Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Budapest Public Prosecutor’s Office informed on Friday, after the expert opinion on the matter had been prepared.
The expert opinion supported the initial investigation, which had already established that the former police captain had not consumed alcohol before getting behind the wheel.
The then head of the XXII. district police station hit a 55-year-old man who did not want to cross the road at the designated pedestrian crossing with his own car while turning in Kossuth Lajos Street in the XXII. district.
(The latter, i.e. that the pedestrian did not cross the zebra, is otherwise not a mitigating circumstance according to the rules of the Highway Code, the cornering motorist must still give priority.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
As a result of the incident, the district police chief resigned his post and asked for his retirement, according to the police, because he was so shocked by the incident.
The Budapest Investigative Prosecutor’s Office is investigating the case.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had cooperated with the prosecutors conducting the investigation from the beginning.
Another €400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three credit facility agreements worth a total of €400 million in support of education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy in Budapest on Friday.
The European Development Bank (EDB) approved a EUR 300 million budget for Hungary’s transport and environment projects under the Cohesion Fund in 2006, of which the parties have already signed a loan agreement of EUR 100 million, and the contract now signed is for the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
A 150 million euro loan agreement will also be used to finance education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary for this purpose, and the remaining EUR 150 million can be used later, by extending the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a 50 million euro contract, which is primarily used for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
There was also talk of Metro 4.
They agreed that when Hungary finalises the details of the financing of the metro with the EU, they will return to the question of whether and how the original contract should be amended.
According to Janos Veres, this will take place in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of EUR 8.4 billion of 113 projects in Hungary.
The interest rate on the loans is linked to EURIBOR with a grace period of 8 years and is provided by the EIB without an availability commission.
Bulgaria is the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing - the attention of the whole of Europe is focused on the previously little-mentioned Balkan country.
What, where and who are buying in the EU’s still cheapest but fast-expensive market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most popular property shopping destination in Eastern Europe right now is without a doubt Bulgaria, with cheap ski apartments and beach houses.
Among the mountains, the most fashionable are the areas of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, and on the coast Albena, the "Golden Coast", the "Sun Beach", the ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for real estate in the area of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later the central part of the country will also attract the interest of investors - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more people are shopping around the extremely cheap Russ, too.
The capital, Sofia, also offers attractive opportunities, with commercial and office spaces offering the highest return on investment.
Bulgaria is on the right track to become one of the most attractive European golf paradises, making it a top destination for the other two seasons in addition to the summer and winter seasons.
As a result, forward-thinking investors are already making big purchases, for example in the area around Bansko.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are also seeking to change their lives and lifestyles.
Most of the customers are English, but they come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, and there are traditionally many Russian customers in the Black Sea and ski resorts.
Foreign buyers can be divided into three groups, says Georgy Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Settlers either buy renovated properties for between 50,000 and 100,000 euros, or run-down old houses for between 5,000 and 15,000 euros, and then renovate them.
They need good accessibility and communication opportunities, it is important for them to have a big city, shops and the proximity of the local doctor in general.
The second category belongs to holiday buyers (Bulgaria was included in the list of the top 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group is made up of business investors who buy in the hope of medium- to long-term value growth.
The price of real estate in the capital is constantly increasing, as demand is increasing.
Bulgaria has one of the lowest house prices in the European Union, but has risen by 21% per year over the past five years.
The rise in real estate prices substantially exceeds the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percent
According to Gábor Fodor, Minister of the Environment and Water Affairs, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations on the post-2012 international climate regime will continue with the ministers.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which provides for efforts to follow the emissions reduction period set by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
This is currently under intense debate between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also indicated that it does not currently want to negotiate precise figures, although it is inclined to agree to a 25-40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990.
Another big question at the conference is whether developed countries will commit not only to reducing emissions, but also to providing both material and technological assistance to countries in need.
There was also agreement on aid for developing countries.
The fund, which is provided for under the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a 16-member Governing Board, expected to be part of the United Nations Global Environment Facility (GEF).
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister of Environment and Water Gábor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to preserve its flagship role in global climate protection efforts and to facilitate the creation of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU is committed to a 20% reduction in its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, regardless of the success of the “post-2012 agreement”, and is ready to commit to a 30% reduction if other large developed regions of the world and developing countries are willing to assume their responsibilities and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor referred to the fact that in 1997 the countries that acceded to the Kyoto Protocol set an overall reduction target of 5.2 percent, within which the EU – then 15 member states – undertook minus 8 percent.
Hungary’s obligation is a 6 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the period 1985-87, which Hungary will meet.
The stakes are high in Bali, as the long-term international climate policy agreement must be concluded within two years, otherwise its entry into force would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by another international emission reduction system, which the latest UN scientific body for climate change, the IPCC, Nobel Peace Prize winner, pointed out as necessary.
This would delay emission reductions and make it inevitable to increase the global average temperature by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists say would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British army recruits on YouTube
Footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan will be posted on the video sharing platform by British military units to promote themselves.
The British Air Force (RAF) was the first to post videos on YouTube: special forces in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of their actions against the Taliban since March 2006.
These miniature helmet-mounted cameras are checked at the Air Force’s operation headquarters in Kandahar and sent to London, where they are uploaded to the Internet by the locals.
The Political Message is Inevitable
Air Force soldiers have already posted 139 videos on the Internet, and their “channel” has been viewed by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and publishes videos of actions in both Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Commonwealth Office and Iraq's International Peacekeeping Forces (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Missions in Afghanistan
The Air Force originally intended the videos to be used for recruitment purposes, and the Defense Ministry said it was also good for informing the public about the real purpose of the military’s presence abroad.
Propaganda in this form costs almost nothing compared to traditional TV recruitment ads, defence expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC, but it inevitably carries some political message as well, as it certifies the validity of military actions decided by the government in a specific form.
The Americans played a game.
The military also has a problem with the fact that in addition to the carefully edited, censored footage, amateur videos are also being shared, which, for example, show the deaths of soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the officers talk only about the losses, but do not show the bloody side of the fight.
Several videos from the Iraq and Afghanistan theatres have already been posted on the internet, but the British military has only recently received them.
Americans recruit in a slightly different way with the free-to-download shooter America's Army, in which players can take on the role of soldiers in a more or less lifelike simulation.
There will be a scones and scones Christmas at the ministries
Labour Minister M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth does not seem sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will hold a year-end workshop for her colleagues, who will be able to say goodbye with scones and coffee from 2007.
There are ministries where there will be a live music party, and elsewhere they conjure up a Christmas atmosphere in the hearts of the officials with raffles and toasts.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffet - so you can have fun with power.
The state offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The Ministry of Defence is hosting the largest-scale Christmas party this year, but the Ministry of Defence is not waiting for the Ministry’s employees.
At the Christmas of the Orphans, the children of the fallen soldiers receive gifts, at the Mission Christmas, the family members of the soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are hosted, but a press reception is also organized.
The portfolio is dedicating $25 million to the end-of-the-year mood.
The National Development Agency (NF<0xC3><0x9C>) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) are out of the question compared to other ministries.
The party of GKM will be held in the House of the Future, with a total of 4,320,000 forints and about three hundred and fifty guests from the 600 ministry employees.
At the wallet ceremony, they will stick to the Christmas spirit, but there will be performers and raffles.
The NF<0xC3><0x9C> Christmas cost HUF 4,700,000 and was held in the building of the National Council for the Judiciary (OIT) on Wednesday – there were concerts and dinners as well.
The room rental cost one million forints, and the rest was spent on the more than four hundred invited guests.
As far as we know, one department of the NFU is also invited to another Christmas celebration: this is organized by a tender management company, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre with EU money.
The building of the V<0xC3><0xAD>gsz<0xC3><0xAD>nház was rented for this purpose.
The information has not been confirmed at MAG Zrt., as we have not been able to reach the competent person.
I don't need a suit
The OIT building hosted not only the NF<0xC3><0x9C>, but also the Ministry of Justice and Law Enforcement, which hosted the Luca Day Ball on December 7 instead of Christmas.
They did not charge any money for the use of the OIT’s rooms.
Five hundred people attended the ball.
The party started with the minister’s greeting, and after dinner they could dance to live music.
In reply to [origo’s] question, it was said that the evening dress or suit was not obligatory at the ball.
The Health, Labour and Local Government ministries are set up for a Puritan party.
The Ministry of Health organises a programme and a celebration for the employees in its own building for HUF 400,000.
However, Minister of Labour M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth is officially not waiting for her colleagues for a Christmas party, but for a workshop at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty guests are expected, who will receive only coffee and scones, so the party will be brought out from 350,000 forints.
On the other hand, Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Government, will simply toast with his colleagues in the hall of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is holding a Christmas gathering in its own hall, for which 436 workers are expected.
Each guest is allocated 2500 HUF for the Christmas party - the amount includes a buffet reception and a toast.
Since János Veres was minister, every year the employees of PM celebrate Christmas in a similar way.
However, there will be no partyhangulat, and the official status will be strengthened not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon appointment.
The Ministry of Agriculture will host a New Year’s reception on January 20, and the Ministry’s Christmas will be cancelled.
The reception will be held in Vajdahunyad Castle, in the City Park, and according to the Ministry, HUF 1,000 will be reserved for each of the 100 guests.
According to the press department, this will be a very simple standing reception, for which only foreign diplomats accredited to Hungary are officially invited.
These annual receptions begin with a brief ministerial welcome and end with a reserved snack.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture will not hold a Christmas party at all, [origo] was told in the relevant press departments.
The cost of the Environment Ministry’s official Christmas could not be determined in the press department.
In any case, more than 400 people were invited to the party, which will be held in the Museum of Applied Arts.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
The League of Trade Unions and the National Federation of Workers’ Councils will form their strike committee coordinating the indefinite strike on Friday.
A large-scale protest meeting will be held on Saturday, and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act, the suspension of work will begin.
The action will certainly cause a significant disruption in transport, as rail transport will be almost completely stopped, and the strike will also take place at BKV until 1 p.m.
On Friday afternoon, the League of Trade Unions will present the details of Monday’s strike organized jointly with the National Federation of Workers’ Councils.
A LIGA-MOSZ strike committee will also be formed, which will coordinate Monday’s actions.
Protesters will hold a rally on Saturday, and on Monday, organizations joining the strike will stop work indefinitely if they cannot reach an agreement with the government.
This means that no date has been set - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act - for the end of the strike that has begun.
If the National Assembly does not pass the health insurance law, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strikes.
If the bill is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide whether to proceed.
According to the agenda of the National Assembly on Monday, it is also possible that the health insurance act will be voted on only in the late evening, or perhaps at night.
Due to the strike starting on Monday, significant disruptions in transport can be expected: work at the railways will be discontinued for an indefinite period, and some of Budapest’s public transport, more than half of the Volán companies, may be shut down in the morning.
At the same time, there will be road closures in many parts of the country.
A number of trade unions and NGOs have joined the strike, and the list will be updated on the day of the League.
Some organisations have called for an indefinite strike, while others have called for temporary layoffs.
Until Thursday afternoon, M<0xC3><0x81>V and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSSZ) could not even agree on sufficient services, even though more and more people travel by rail as the Christmas holidays approach.
According to the current announcements, the BKV will be on strike from the start of operation until 1 p.m. at Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the LIGA Electricity and Thermal Energy Trade Unions will hold a four-hour strike, and the Teachers’ Union and the Teachers’ Democratic Trade Union have called for a two- and two-eight-hour strike.
The Hungarian Medical Association is on strike nationwide, at alternate times, and the Democratic Trade Union of Workers in the Health and Social Sector (EDDSZ) is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands of the League is that the government withdraw the proposal for health insurance reform and submit a new concept for public debate.
The second demand is to gradually introduce the new method of calculating pensions due from next year.
The third is to ensure the possibility of entering the system before 2010 in the case of early-retirement benefits for worthy jobs.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSSZ), which is part of the League Trade Unions, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport regarding the railway lines, but expects a different offer.
Political Capital: the Hungarian Guard increased the country’s risk
The activity of the Hungarian Guard, founded in August this year with the support of the Jobbik Movement for Hungary, increased the political risk of Hungary and the region in several respects, according to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital.
In the company’s “risk warning”, they wrote that the greatest political risk in connection with the activity of the Hungarian Guard is that “by exacerbating the already existing ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Roma population in Hungary, violent ethnic clashes may already develop in the short term”.
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is presumably aimed at provoking such an act, the research institute added.
“The public debate on the Roma issue was left to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to build a political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian antagonism,” the statement said.
This deepens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists, and increases the likelihood of violent conflict, they say.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activities of the Hungarian Guard “have significantly worsened the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of the belief in the country’s stability and democratic development”, due to the large amount of domestic and international media attention.
It is recalled that since the autumn of 2006 radical and far-right groups in Hungary have gained increasing publicity and momentum as a result of the reorganization of several organizations calling themselves “national self-defence” associations that have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007.
“The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil organizations, while openly proclaiming the preparation of their members – even armed ones – for defence (disaster protection, defence, law enforcement) tasks, moreover, citing the incompetence of the police, the army, i.e. the state,” they added.
They noted that this is done in accordance with a method that seeks to put different political aspirations into civilian clothes based on the anti-political and anti-party nature of society.
The emphasis on civility and the form of the association is not only meant to avoid the legal pitfalls of court registration in the case of these associations, but also serves as a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk-increasing factor in terms of neighbourhood relations.
“In recent months, several neighbouring countries have referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of danger, while ultranationalist political figures in some neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the formation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this affects the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in East-Central Europe, so political risks have increased for the region as a whole.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The formation of the Bulgarian Guard is due to the mass riots of the Roma in one of the districts of Sofia (Krasna Polyana).
The BNU took advantage of this to decide on the formation of a guard, saying that the organization’s goal is “national self-defense”.
According to them, there has been a “Gypsy terror” in Bulgaria over the past 17 years, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent, Political Capital reminds.
They added that the initiative sparked a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
The increase in the risk of ethnic clashes is indicated by the fact that some Roma organisations in Bulgaria have announced that they will create their own garrison as a form of resistance.
As the operation of the Hungarian Guard so far shows similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma respond to the threat in the same way, by organizing their own self-defence.
Attila Juhász, Director of Research at Political Capital said that risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
They publish their risk assessments on an annual basis and, if they see anything that could affect the change in risk, inform the public, as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
There are no red flags everywhere.
In Hungary, the red-letter days are clearly marked by the law, and it has become common practice to rearrange workdays around the holidays, which will be reduced next year.
There is no uniform celebration in the United States and the United States.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and state holidays and public holidays.
Public holidays are mostly associated with church holidays and significant historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year here: the last day of the old year and the first day of the new one are both holidays - the latter for the rest of the New Year's Eve.
We have a total of 11 red-letter holidays throughout the year.
The 15th of March and the 23rd of October, commemorating the Revolution of 1848, are also national holidays.
On the 20th of August we celebrate the foundation of the state, on the 1st of May we celebrate the work, and on the 1st and 2nd of November we commemorate our deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, we celebrate Easter, Pentecost and Christmas on two days.
Since our state, national, or religious holidays rarely fall on the weekends according to the calendar, it has become common practice to transfer workdays in cases where we would only work one day before or after the red-letter holiday.
True, the price of extended weekends is that we do not stay away from work and school on the previous Saturdays.
The exact time of the day immediately before or after the holiday is regulated by a separate decree of the Minister of Labour for many years.
The law applies to all employers and their employees, civil servants and public service employees alike.
However, it does not affect service companies and institutions operating without interruption and operating on public holidays due to their intended purpose.
This year, the work schedule will only change around the end of the year holidays: from December 24, life in the country will almost stop, since, according to experience, the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve will be "slipped" by the majority of people, or they will use their saved holidays for this purpose.
Next year we will have several holidays in the middle or at the end of the week, so there will be less workday relocations than this year.
First, the calendar changes around the work day, so that employees can stay at home for four consecutive days.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day, in exchange for Friday, May 2, being a day of rest.
The second relocation is related to the October 23 holiday: on Saturday, October 18th, you will have to work instead of Friday, October 24th.
The end of the year, however, can be spent in the spirit of the holiday next year, as from December 24, almost everywhere there will be a nonstop break, even if the New Year’s Eve falls on Wednesday.
6 little things you can do to annoy your colleagues
Emails we forget to send, voicemail messages we never get, innocent lies we almost don’t even notice: they “color” the everyday life at work.
The question is whether you get used to small inconveniences or put on the gloves and consciously avoid ambiguous situations that cause annoyance to others.
Tips.
“Sorry, I forgot to tell you that you were looking for me in the marketing department,” one of your colleagues said.
That you missed a meeting because of that?
At best, he’ll apologize and try to make up for it, perhaps calling the marketing department to tell you he forgot to deliver the message (this is the less-ordinary solution).
Most of the time, it's done with an apology.
Before you make an embarrassing apology, it’s worth thinking about what you can do to make your colleagues feel uncomfortable and make a conscious effort to avoid it.
Are you borrowing something that doesn’t belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than reaching for a piece of paper, stationery, or your phone, and it's nowhere to be found.
Do you remember yesterday you put your stapler on the table, but it took off in the morning?
Do you find your lost pen on a colleague’s desk?
Do not take anything from your colleagues without asking, because they will rightly be angry at you for stealing their property.
Don’t put office envelopes or post-it in your pocket, because it can be unpleasant if it runs out before your time and you need it immediately.
Are you gossiping about your colleagues' personal lives?
There is no good way to stop the rumors that are already spreading.
Who, who, what did he do?
Where and why?
Don’t tell everyone about your colleagues’ private life.
If one of them shares their deepest secrets with you, don’t abuse their trust.
Bury what you hear, and do not discuss it with your colleagues in your absence, even if others know about your colleague’s conduct.
Unjustifiably report sick?
When you call the office and report a splitting headache because you feel unwell or you feel you would rather rest that day; remember that your work, your urgent tasks, your deadline work must be done by someone else for you.
Don’t mess with your colleagues.
If you know in advance that you won’t be going to the office the next day, or that something might come up that will force you to stay at home, let your colleagues and bosses know that you won’t be missing them the next day.
growl, giggle, phone call
You get into the work, but you get dragged out of it by the giggles of your colleagues?
Have you unwittingly overheard a phone conversation that would have been better left unheard?
Do not disturb your co-workers with humming, singing, loud talking (which you do over their heads), nor with beating feet, constant swearing, loud discontent.
All of these can be confusing, even if they are not involved in a project (writing, planning, organizing).
Do you blame others for your mistakes?
If you don’t have something in time, you forgot to send an important letter or message, don’t blame others for your forgetfulness!
Don't refer to the chaos in the office, your noisy colleagues.
Admit when you have made a mistake and someone else has suffered a disadvantage, and eliminate the damage.
Ask yourself how you can make up for your mistake and make up for your failure.
Do you feel at home in the office?
Bear pants and slippers: comfortable to wear at home, but not in the office!
Don’t wear comfortable clothes even if your job allows it.
Don’t be sloppy, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing ordinary clothes – if your job demands it, pretty and elegant – to go to the office!
If you want to meet me, you're not interesting anymore
Driving the car in the usual morning traffic.
From the radio comes a special melody: the sound of a violin, accompanied by electronic effects.
I'm gonna turn the volume up.
The music changes pace and the bass arrives next to the earlier tones, then a female choir joins in as a real jewel.
Zagar's "Wings of Love" is on mr2.
For a long time, the Hungarian music scene did not spoil us with high-quality electronic pop.
But now it seems like the traffic is different when you're listening to the new Zagar record.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few new and exciting productions coming up from the Hungarian digital underground, slowly changes the overall picture, and despite the fashion of the guitar-playing garage rock, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started from Pécs, and he played in Yonderboi’s band himself, until – perhaps because two pipers did not fit in a csárda – he set out on his own path.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, which combines elements of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, he started to break through when he was asked to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
Ferenc T<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>k Season).
His formations, initially playing in smaller clubs, became known to a wider audience when wan2 magazine ranked their first album in 2002 as one of the fifty most important domestic albums, and declared Zagar, together with Yonderboi, to be the only Hungarian trendsetters that seemed to be marketable even in the West.
Without a doubt, Zagar and his band became "trendy", but of course no one asked them if they liked wearing the label.
The band reacted as they should: they made a new, better record.
The newly released album Cannot Walk Fly Instead may open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to create continuity with the early years of Pécs.
This was one of the lines of Balázs Zságer’s old band there.
We would be on the spot with the airy, flying reference, but besides the airiness of the music, we noticed the effect of the louder guitar, rock and roll, according to the spirit and trend of the time.
In these songs, Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rgy Ligeti, currently working with The Puzzle in England, showed himself at the premiere of the album in Millenáris.
The album also produced a real radio hit: Mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, who plays popular music from morning to night, started to smuggle into the ears the grandiose melodies of Wings of Love recorded with the six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
All is well (?).
HVG.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit now raises the question: how much layer music is left of what you are playing?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of layer music does not mean much to me.
I think there are two categories of popular music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
So-called alternative, underground music can also be flat, meaningless, and just as much for sale as commercial music.
But a good pop song can also come from genuine motivation.
The attitude of the host also operates in this spirit, regardless of language and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences towards your music?
B. Zs.: Abroad, especially to the west of us, popular music has larger traditions.
It’s not only the 11-year-olds who go to concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the popular music changes taking place around them, because they consider it part of contemporary culture as well.
HVG.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course it feels good that more and more people come to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
In our country, music is not born for a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience is more noticeable at concerts, where there is already an effect on each other, but this is only in the elusive changes of the moment.
Still, I've noticed that if you want to please your audience, you're no longer interesting.
HVG: How well do you plan to follow Yonderboi’s example?
He works as a soloist and has built his career further west than us.
Zs.B.: We don’t really follow his path, even if sometimes they try to explain it into our music.
We’re more like team players who trust each other’s musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, of course, it was inevitable that our works would be compared to Yonderboi’s music, as many of us left his band and started on a different path.
hvg.hu: Mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi’s Wings of Love was ranked first.
Many people have heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
Are you consciously opening up to a wider audience with a more popular style?
B. Zs.: We didn’t have a plan to write a hit, and then we sell the album with it.
This song is about more than that.
It was intended to be the finale of the album, with which we tried to resolve the sound orgy and the more difficult themes that had been created on the album.
HVG: How did you choose the six singers?
Why them - what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The idea was to have a gospel-like choir.
It was then that the idea came to compose this choir from the good-sounding soloists of our own domestic musical scene.
This is how the six-member choir - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC5><0x91> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - came together, which we named Underground Divas.
HVG.hu: Is this how the girls designed the song or did they do it?
Zs.B.: The song has existed in an instrumental version for a long time, and then when the album material came together, we thought that we needed something more for this song.
The chord progression attracted me to put a vocal part on it.
That same night, I sang the melody that the girls later learned.
It was almost spontaneous and scary at first.
I remember being very excited at the time, but of course I needed the Divas.
With my voice, it wouldn't have worked so powerfully.
hvg.hu: Both on the album and at the concert, the girls seemed to be in the background.
There are no solos (except for Judy Jay’s short solo), they don’t have their own roles, they sing completely together and they don’t sound louder than the music, so the music doesn’t just accompany their singing.
They were at the back of the stage.
Is that intentional?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were standing in the back was purely due to technical problems.
We knew we didn’t want to split the roles.
That’s what my mouth is all about, to forget a little bit about my ego, where it came from, where it’s going, but let those wings, those wings of love, lift us up.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
HW: Which one did you do the most work with?
Zs.B.: There were actually no pieces with the musical creative process, rather there were pieces that were more difficult to mix.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play on a tournament piano, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time the groove didn't want to work, and then slowly everything came to its place, like in a puzzle game.
HVG: What’s your favorite song from the new album?
Zs.B.: This changes all the time with the concerts and with the fact that I have already "let go" of the album.
Now Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth, and Never The Same.
The Betrayal Broker Risked Billions Due to Feeling of Minority
Disloyal embezzler.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, the French bank Sociéte Générale, calls his former employee Jerome Kerviel.
Because of Kerviel, he lost almost five billion euros.
However, it seems that Kerviel, who was not untalented at all, was just a big player trying to catch up with his colleagues.
Unlike other banks, he recognized the crisis of the American mortgage market in time.
"Decreased mental capacity," he said of his superiors, who informed the police.
However, as Le Monde reported, Kerviel’s testimony shows that at the end of last year, he made a profit of 1.6 billion euros from his business.
Crisis not only in America
"I just wanted to make money for my bank," he says in his testimony.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros during the American crisis.
He saw the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were reports that there would be problems with so-called subprime mortgages for customers with low incomes or with repayment problems in the past.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe in that, and he got on the right horse.
Its profit at the end of the year amounted to 1.6 billion euros.
“Even when I made the first half billion, I didn’t know how to announce it,” Kerviel admits, adding that he didn’t keep anything for himself.
In his confession, he admits that he falsified his reports in such a way that it could not be revealed.
He also managed to fool his bosses, even when the Eurex stock exchange became interested in his deals.
The risk was a gain
Were you afraid that everything would turn out?
I'd rather not.
“I thought the mere fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank would calm them down.”
Where did he get the willpower to risk so much?
Gradually he reached his position.
After graduating from the University of Lyon, he began working for Société Générale in 2000.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was a brokerage assistant and became an independent broker in 2005 with a salary of $90,000 a year.
However, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
“In 2005, during my first conversation, I knew I was being looked down upon.
Because of my education, my professional and personal development," Kerviel told investigators.
Shortly after his entry, he achieved his first great success.
Allianz’s shares earned him a fortune, as he staked half a billion euros on the fall of those shares during the London bombings.
And this triggered an avalanche - he wanted more.
As long as you're looking, we'll leave you alone
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But his bosses supposedly knew, or rather suspected, everything.
"While I was making money, they turned a blind eye."
There was an accident at the beginning of the year.
In a single day, he lost one billion euros.
He wanted to cover it up one weekend in mid-January.
When he left for work on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they find out?
Because of his freedom, he became suspicious.
"I've only taken four days off last year.
A broker who has no freedom is a broker who doesn’t want anyone to have a look at his reports,” Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a $365 billion chance of winning.
Together with representatives of the European Commission, the ministers of the Czech government have signed a total of nine operational programmes, of which the Czech Republic will receive EUR 14 billion (approximately CZK 365 billion) in the coming years.
The Czech Republic will receive roughly half of the total amount from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
The regions will receive around 125 billion kroner from seven operational programmes.
Czech companies will be able to raise around 100 billion kroner from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money, 150 billion kroner, goes to transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents 22% of the funds available to the Czech Republic.
These funds will increase the state fund for transport infrastructure, which will manage 90.8 billion kroons next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme helps entrepreneurs and companies to win funds for innovation entrepreneurship.
Companies should also raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is among the least successful in attracting funds from EU funds in the newly admitted countries.
Former Nicaraguan president sentenced to 20 years in prison
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal on Thursday upheld a 20-year prison sentence for former president Arnold Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 of $100 million (almost $1.8 billion) in financial fraud.
He was later released from prison and lived under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital.
Whether the former leader of this Central American country from 1997 to 2002 will be put back behind bars is not yet clear, according to the AP news agency.
Ileana Perez, president of the Court of Appeals, said it would be up to the prison authorities to decide whether to allow Aleman to serve his sentence at home or to return to prison.
Four years ago, the court found that Alemán regularly transferred government funds to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These fictitious companies and their account numbers were in reality the property of their relatives and closest supporters.
Some of this money went to a foundation he founded to finance Alemán’s 2001 election campaign.
Our budget has been approved
That's right.
The state budget was approved.
What is so special about this budget?
This is the first budget drawn up by this government, approved by a coalition majority, without the support of the opposition.
This year, last year, it passed with the support of the Social Democrats, because Minister Sobotka and the Czech Social Democratic Party could not afford not to accept it.
Unlike the loud debate about distrust of the government before the vote, this time there was no drama.
The House of Representatives passed this generally ignored, albeit most influential, law.
This is a certain contradiction.
All governance begins and ends with each chapter and item in the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of politics, but it is hidden behind the power struggles of the government and the opposition.
It's more grateful that way in the press, which is why it gets much more attention in the media.
Politicians’ debates are more interesting to the public than mere numbers.
The state budgets of past social democratic governments have had three shortcomings that the 2008 budget cannot solve at the same time:
The first of them is the high rate of mandatory, so-called client expenditure law, which includes not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved last year by the silent "coalition" of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M before the elections
The second is deficit management as a consequence of the first deficiency.
The third limit is the public funding deficits, i.e. the budget deficits of cities and districts.
The biggest risk, however, is not the government deficit.
It is public and relatively under control.
Time bombs are the budget deficits of cities and districts.
Many mayors were able to raise money for investments other than taxes, levies, and bank loans, and often issued bonds that disproportionately indebted their town halls.
In recent years, these debts have been paid off by the massive sale of shares in the energy and other distribution networks that the State has provided it with through privatisations.
They no longer have such a source.
If we rely only on official and verifiable facts, we conclude that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a growth phase for a few years now, with which the Czech Social Democratic Party is constantly boasting.
This was a unique opportunity for governments to put public funding in order.
Instead, the country has been plunged into debt.
The other countries, with two exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan and Egypt, were much more rational than the Czech Republic.
This is a great shame for previous governments.
We are among the countries that are least at risk of poverty on a global scale.
That is why, for example, there is no need for huge social programmes, which unfortunately have grown to gigantic proportions in recent years.
Although this year we managed to eliminate some of the senseless populist expenditures approved before the elections this year, even if in the near future there will be no pushing of the retirement limit and pension reform, then in this country any policy will actually come to an end, and whoever governs it will only be a clerical exercise.
With a slight exaggeration, most of the taxed money from the governing politicians is usually converted into retirement and social benefits into mechanical distributions.
That is why this year’s budget cannot be revolutionary, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure by the expenditure of the client.
The $70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if previous governments had not squandered everything they could in the last decade.
If we do not really want it to become mere officials of the governing politicians, then we must be patient and wish peace in the preparation of further reform laws for this not-too-strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only give out what it can obtain from taxes and duties.
This is the only way to achieve a balanced budget.

The banks want to solve the crisis.
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
Financial markets are thus costing more than $100 billion through the stock markets.
On these exchanges, the interest rate on the bank is raised, for which they are ready to lend money.
For example, the U.S. Federal Reserve will put forty billion dollars on the stock exchange and make another twenty-four available to the European and Swiss central banks.
For the first time since the attacks of 11 September, the central banks of each country have agreed on a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This move should solve the biggest problems facing the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend,” Bernard Baumohl, a consultant for the Economic Outlook Group, wrote in a report to clients.
“Coordinated action by central banks has reduced the probability of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent,” Baumohl said.
Banks in the U.S. have already lost $60 billion due to unpaid loans.
Analysts expect further losses of billions.
“The central banks can really be afraid of what might happen if they decide to do something like this,” said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are afraid that if banks themselves find it difficult to access loans, they will also lend to their customers at a higher cost.
This would reduce demand and plunge the U.S. economy into recession with potential consequences for global economic growth.
The central banks decided to do so after the failure of the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank offer rate cut, which is used for lending money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of lending money to each other, despite the fact that the central banks of the USA, Canada and Great Britain also lowered their interest rates a few times during the autumn.
"This will have a similar effect to further interest rate cuts," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the actions of central banks will help to avert the crisis, as they will not solve the basic problem of the fall of the US real estate market.
Klaus: The incredible debates of ecologists
Global climate change is a major threat to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again gave his opinion on the problem of global warming.
This time, he criticized the UN International Conference on Climate Change held in Bali.
The book Blue, presented in Vienna, not the green planet, made the point that the debates of ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, consisting of a peculiar mix of representatives of governments and civil society organisations, but also the fundamental difference between the accompanying rhetoric and reality.
“The debate there is absolutely lacking structure, it’s just throwing words at it, which are a substitute for solving the current problems,” Klaus said.
In presenting his book, the Czech President stressed that his topic was very important to him, which is why he is so committed to this topic.
He expressed his satisfaction with the fact that the book is also translated into German, because, as he said, "I often only encounter caricatures of my opinions".
So now those interested can read his unbiased opinion.
Klaus pointed out that although he was not a climatologist, he believed that he had sufficient grounds to write such a book.
Being able to monitor and evaluate professional dissertations as an academic with experience in statistics and also as an economist.
He concluded the book by stating as his thesis that the climate is constantly changing, that its changes are normal, and that not all scientists agree on the warming of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious, therefore, do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence climate change are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
In addition, as a person with experience in totalitarianism, he regards the imposition of unproven opinions on others as unacceptable, which he perceives as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
To the questions of those present, he repeatedly explained that "it is not against the rational protection of the environment, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits."
Klaus had already spoken on a similar topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people could not exchange their driving licenses
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and were unable to exchange their old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when they can apply for a replacement so that the authorities can issue the new driver’s license in time for the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the New Year 100,000 drivers would leave without a valid entitlement.
According to the authorities, the driver’s license was not exchanged primarily by those who no longer want to drive.
While districts are reporting a sharp drop in interest in driver's license exchanges, the capital's offices have been flooded with requests for driver's license exchanges, on which interest has increased this week.
The mayor’s office receives about 2,000 clients a day.
You have to wait in line for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers still had their driver’s license unchangeable.
Issuing a new driver's license takes 20 days.
However, a new driving licence can also be applied for with a shortened deadline of five days.
In this case, the driver will have to pay an additional 500 crowns.
Drivers who fail to change their driving licence by the end of the year and start driving with an invalid driving licence will face a penalty from January.
The guilty must pay a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
However, the police officer may also settle the offence by agreement.
In the case of an administrative offence, the penalty is 2500 kroner.
Based on the information received from the City Council, anyone who does not travel anywhere can also be fined.
It can cost up to 30,000 kroner.
The ministry had previously called on the authorities to be lenient and to impose fines of up to 1,000 crowns.
But Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka said tens of thousands of fines would not threaten anyone.
A driver’s license is a document that allows people to decide whether they want to drive or not.
This is not an identity card, which must be valid for everyone.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give up their driver's license.
It is enough to take it or recommended to mail it to the appropriate office.
By the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will no longer be valid.
However, drivers will have to gradually replace other types of driving licences.
Those with documents from 1994 to 2000 can be replaced for another three years.
Licences issued between 2001 and 2004 will only expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million additional documents.
The court reduced the sentence of the detectives allied with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, suspected of conspiring with David Berdych’s criminal network, were sentenced to 13 and 10 years in prison respectively.
The Supreme Court of Prague decided on this with final effect, which thus reduced the sentences for one of them by one year and for the other by two years.
Investigators in Prague’s Organized Crime Division were initially threatened with 14- and 12-year prison terms.
Today’s decision can no longer be appealed, but can only be reviewed by the Supreme Court.
Although Berdych is also suspected in this case, he is awaiting a first-instance verdict.
In other cases, he has been sentenced to more than 16 years in total.
You can't have any more.
The County Court in January found 19 people primarily guilty of involvement in robberies, of which the Supreme Court today heard 16 appeals.
The majority of the defendants rejected the charges from the beginning of the investigation, saying that it was a speculative case.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, after the agreement with Berdych, members of the police provided the criminals with information from police sources, covered up individual robberies and helped the gang avoid criminal liability.
The gang gave 30 percent of the robbery to Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k.
The indictment relates to crimes committed by the gang between 1999 and 2001.
These are primarily robberies, the victims of which have often suffered serious damage to their health, but also abuse of the powers of a civil servant and unauthorised possession of weapons.
Because the police found illegally-held pistols, steel-core bullets, laser pointers, or submachine guns during house searches.
The gang is accused of looting tens of millions of crowns.
The gang of just under 20 members has already been found guilty by the courts of other robberies by Berdych and many others.
Other members of Berdych’s circle are also testifying in court in other proceedings, some of which have not yet been brought to trial.
The trial at first instance has so far avoided Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Puta and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulejt, who are in pre-trial detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
Invoice for child exchange: 12 million
Igor Veleba, a lawyer for the families involved in the swap, is demanding a 12 million kroner pain payment from the T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> hospital, along with court expenses.
Three million for each mother, two million for each father, and one million for each child.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 per parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dostál Veleba, fundamentally disagrees with the proposal.
"We reject such a demand because it is too much," Dostál said after today's trial.
"In order to form an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need an expert opinion from the opponent.
Find out if it has any value at all.
But we maintain our view that this will be measured in hundreds of thousands for everyone,” Dostál stressed.
The amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 K<0xC4><0x8D> for the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov family wanted one million crowns for every month that they did not raise their own biological daughter.
Veleba was the subject of a peer review that was developed by the Motol University Hospital in Prague.
According to psychologists and psychiatric experts, the parents of the children suffered psychological damage and stress of varying degrees and depths.
Stress was better tolerated by men, even when they were so reproached that they didn’t stop the newborn from changing.
Women are coping worse with the actuality of the trauma they have experienced and what is happening right now, Veleba summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the maternity clinic in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their birth parents - Nikola <0xC4><0x8C>ermák in P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice, Veronika Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
At the end of October, Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina district manager Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il gave the families 100,000 crowns to make up for their expenses, which were caused by the fault of the T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ské hospital, which is controlled by the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic have statutory damage insurance.
In case of error, they must resort to the reserve fund, in exceptional cases they can ask for the help of the founder.
So far, the courts have approved relatively low compensation for people, and the amounts have been calculated on the basis of tables of a few hundred thousand, and in exceptional cases a few million crowns.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost his lawsuit for the title of Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko.
According to the judge of the district court of Ostrava, although he first used the name “King of Valach”, the project was developed by a team around the actor Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, who worked for many years.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka was not present at the trial today.
However, according to his legal representative, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The debate is about Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team preying on the popularity of Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka," Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words “Kingdom of Valachi” remind everyone of the actor-comedian.
This view is shared by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
“We have almost 10 years of work behind us.
Finding money and inventing actions,” he said.
The reason for the debate is money.
“Years later, they realized that the project was a success and they could gain something from it.
They want to live off our work,” he added.
Profitable business
According to the court, the name "King of Valachia" was first used by Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in his television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD>.
At the time, however, this was unrelated to the purpose of building a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of issuing Valachian passports.
The original student prank action turned into a business and profitable entrepreneurial activity, on which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> then based the establishment of the society of the kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko.
In 1997, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka agreed to indicate his name and signature on passports, and even offered their owners discounts when visiting his farm and theatrical performances.
Who will take the throne?
The judge also mentioned today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used the idea, which Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka made public in the manesz for his business.
"The popularity of Boleslav Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka for the Valachi kingdom project certainly helped," the judge said.
However, he added that the heart of the project was the intensively working Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team.
The co-operation of the now disputable parties continued until 2000, when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized an official coronation for Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Since then, however, disputes have piled up between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, culminating in the acquittal of "the eternally elected King Boleslav I".
On Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>'s initiative, Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>uláková took over as Queen Mother.
In 2002, she brought an action against Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and others, which was rejected by the court today.
A battle planned by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> for the throne and half of the princess could shed light on the controversy.
This war should make a new king.
He did not want to reveal the details or the date.
“We don’t want to rush anything.
It's supposed to be something like the royal march on Slovacko.
The king should be elected for a definite period of time.
Mr Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can also come forward," added Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Peugeot test of the 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearing prejudices
To be honest, I never liked the Peugeot 206.
The thread characteristics are nothing special, the quality of the change, the driving and the production can often be marked as below-average.
But its successor, the Peugeot 207, which is already present on the market, is significantly better.
And the station wagon, called the SW, goes one step further, so I have no choice but to think more.
When I was testing the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207, for example, I complained about the space left for the head in the back seat.
This time, the complaining ends here, because the body of the station wagon means that even the two-meter-high giants do not suffer in this regard.
Urgently in the world
I get through the interior quickly, so as not to repeat myself often.
It’s a relatively well done design, where my only objection is to the poor console.
Here I would appreciate a little more designer invention, since the exterior of the car is so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and where are the times when we complained about the short lower part of the seat or armrests.
The lateral drive has also been significantly improved compared to the 206 model.
As far as space is concerned, there is also an increase in the size of the body.
Then, in the station wagon, the little places of the head that have already been mentioned disappear.
Suitcases in the trunk
The main thing in this car is the luggage compartment.
This should be considered very accessible (thanks to the fold-out rear window) and spacious.
Empty spaces are equipped with support tires, which are ideal compromises.
They are not in the way, they can be pulled apart and can carry heavier objects.
But let's stick to volume for a while.
Based on the tables, this is 428 l in the basic layout, which is a more average value compared to the competition.
However, in the Czech Republic it is not the most demanded vehicle of this class - the Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation from mlada boleslav, we can see that the Peugeot lags well behind the noticeably high 52 litres.
For a holiday abroad or when placing a stroller, this value is almost critical.
But if I were to highlight the positives, then I must also mention the almost completely straight floor after folding the backrests of the second row or the very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder, foreign ignition engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what the 1600 should look like, driving the family hatchback.
It is quiet, low-consumption and primarily pulls.
Compared to its <0xC5><0xA0>KODA counterpart, which often acts as if a rag had been stuck in its exhaust, I can only be pleased.
whisper of the price
The price of the car is not cheap.
However, we must remember that we tested a car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The car still costs 329,900 K<0xC4><0x8D> with a four-cylinder foreign engine.
The car starts at 410 990 K<0xC4><0x8D>, which is quite a lot.
The tested Premium equipment drops the equipment by an additional 80,000 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
But we also had head airbags, automatic climate control, automatic windshield wipers, electric remote control of the rear windows....
That is, the car with a tow case costs 531 900 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
This is a lot, but count the additional equipment of the Fabia and you will get a very similar result.
So there is nothing left to do but decide for the brand.
Unsuccessful integration of Slovak students in British schools
A growing number of children in British schools in Eastern Europe are raising concerns among locals about the further development of the local school system.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a number of obstacles.
British schools have already registered cases where disputes between children of immigrants and domestic residents have escalated into violence.
The problems related to the integration of children in Eastern Europe are well illustrated by a case in North Kent, where disputes between their places and Slovak immigrants are intensifying.
The quarrels and quarrels between the students already characterize the relations of the parents.
The situation has escalated to the point where police in Chatham have arrested a Slovakian woman who beat a ten-year-old student with an iron rod.
The accused pleads that the boy insulted him with racist insults.
The police had to act even after two twelve-year-old girls attacked a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly insulted the man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
“On the way home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told her to stop doing this, she hit us with apples and pears and then revealed her naked butt,” the mother of the Slovak students wrote in an email to The Times.
There are complaints from both sides.
One local resident described disputes over immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The above-mentioned cases suggest that the atmosphere in British schools is becoming tense between locals and immigrants.
There are 70,000 Slovaks in the UK looking for work.
Around 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it can be fulfilled if you choose correctly.
The golden and white shores, the high waves, or the sea, calm as a pond.
Palm trees and all inclusive on the beach with waiters offering pizza, ice cream or intoxicating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the Caribbean islands, you can find a complete and even richer list of this.
But there is much more to discover on one island: Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Great Antilles.
Under the Spanish, Cuba was a bastion of their American conquests.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a treasure trove and a place of reloading, which the Spaniards looted in America and shipped to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Nacional Hotel was built in the late 20s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the bosses of the American mafia, built it, because everything that was considered a crime in the US (primarily Prohibition) was welcomed in Cuba and supported drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High-rise buildings were built in Havana, and cars became the cult symbol of the 50s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and had his own yacht in Coj<0xC3><0xAD>mar.
The walls of Bodeguita del Medio are decorated with the signatures of the stars and politicians of the American show business.
And today?
You can also mark the wall of Bodeguita in Havana with your own signature.
At the bar of the expensive Nacional Hotel, you will be served a cocktail of your choice.
And the cult cars of the '50s are still in service in Havana today, because the once-exported guinea pigs and your son in this salty and wet air have long since rotted away.
Although the oldest part of Havana has been devastated, there are not as many beautiful colonial monuments in the area as there are there.
Other places are getting nicer, too, like Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism provides so much needed money, its development has received a green light.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have been built not only in Havana, but also in Varader, on the coast of the province of Holgu<0xC3><0xAD>n and on such islands as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a unique delicacy in the world, which is appreciated primarily by train lovers.
From their extensive plantations, the sugar cane was transported to the sugar factories by steam and motor trains.
Their engine park has not been renewed for decades, so machines operating there can be seen, whose contemporaries can only be seen in museums elsewhere.
Which way do we go?
The most well-known places are not avoided by most visitors to Cuba.
So you don't need to write too much about Varader or Havana.
Perhaps we should just remind you that the Hemingway estate mentioned above has a museum, and those who love the writer should not miss a visit to this museum.
The Vi<0xC5><0x88>ales Valley is one of the most picturesque parts of Cuba in the western part of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from a limestone substrate.
Limestone formations, limestone mountain cones and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley, and fertile soil has accumulated in their hollows, thanks to which the collapsed cliffs are also covered with dense vegetation.
The valley is a place where perhaps the highest quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
Its final form can be found during a visit to a cigar factory in Havana.
Some may also find it interesting that Major Zeman’s Chilean episode was filmed there.
Trinidad (disambiguation)
It is an ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonization of the island.
The slave and sugar trade brought fame and glory.
The economy was embodied in the beauty and monumentality of the not-so-large city.
The colonial Spanish architecture, heavily influenced by later French settlers, has changed almost nothing in four centuries.
Between the Escambray plain and the sea, Trinidad is so secluded that even in the 50s of the last century, there were no roads linking this region with the rest of the country.
That isolation helped him to remain an outsider.
They didn’t build anything there, so they didn’t demolish it, everyone was happy to have a roof over their heads.
If you have more than an afternoon in Trinidad, it’s worth checking out some of the area’s interesting sites, such as Playa Ancon and the Valley of the Sugar Factory.
In the evening it is appropriate to go to the Casa de la M<0xC3><0xBA>sica, which wakes up after dark, where the music is quiet only in the morning.
Baracoa
Located in the eastern part of Cuba, the city is considered by some to be the most beautiful city.
Surely this opinion is already influenced by the path itself.
Both routes from Guantanamo have to overcome high and rugged mountains, crossing nature barely touched by human activity.
Cuba's eastern land bridge has been listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site due to its unspoiled nature.
The best chocolate is made here, in the church there is the cross of Columbus (in reality, it was made a hundred years after Columbus sailed) and from the hill where the former castle stood and today stands the hotel El Castillo, you can see a few tabletops, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Meastro plain, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the Cuban patron saint of Caridad del Cobra, Santeria, the African religion professed by the descendants of former slaves, there is much to be said about all this.
As they say, it’s better to see it once.
Afghan Allies Are Passive, Says U.S.
The lack of troops and equipment are also affecting the U.S. mission in Afghanistan.
Defense Secretary Robert Gates said NATO should outline concrete plans for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going according to plan, the leaders of the countries that have units in the south of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban movement, the eight participating countries are also discussing further plans and coordination of the Allies.
While the United States, with the assistance of Defense Secretary Robert Gates, has called on NATO troops to be more active this week, Britain is prioritising the strengthening of the Afghan government and development assistance.
“The development in Afghanistan is palpable, but military force can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the population to start their own further development of the economy and security,” Des Browne, the British defence minister, told the BBC.
Ninety per cent
According to the U.S. government, the Afghan insurgency has been at its strongest in the past five years.
The number of violent incidents increased by 27 percent compared to last year, and by 60 percent in southern Helmand province.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the south.
According to the United States, however, the Allies have also reached their limits in terms of the organisation and equipment of the troops.
In particular, additional helicopters, soldiers and experts were requested to train Afghan troops.
"We need to think seriously about the specific goals for the future and the ways to achieve them," <0xC5><0x99>ekl Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop spoke in a similar vein today.
“I’m not happy with what’s on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
“We have about 90 percent of the soldiers and the equipment we need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of a three-day conversation with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there have also been debates among the participating countries about whether all allies are offering the maximum in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, was criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans are present in Afghanistan in relatively large numbers.
However, they were deployed in areas with the least violence and combat requirements so they are not as high as they are against us in the south and east of the country,” Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called the German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan slackers have been exposed: Germans are playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in a photo of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild launched a counter-offensive and published a photo of a British team's rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
The national debt will reach one trillion in 2009
The Czech Republic has a public debt of 84,000 kroons.
Total debt reached 842.7 billion kroons by the end of September.
The government is planning to borrow 159.2 billion kronor this year.
However, by the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced this plan by 152.8 billion crowns due to better development of the state budget.
The public debt of the Czech Republic reached 842.7 billion kroons at the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion kroons.
However, from June it decreased by 13.4 billion kroons.
Today, the Ministry of Finance confirmed its debt data from the beginning of October.
Each Czech has more than 84,000 kroner in debt.
Last year, the state owed more than 11 billion kroner.
“For the time being, it seems that due to the lower deficit next year, we could only exceed the one trillion kroner limit in 2009.
Next year, the debt will be around 900 billion kronor and one trillion kronor,” said David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance for iHNed.cz.
In a similar vein, Next Finance analyst Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pikora said: “In 2009, we will be able to cross the one trillion mark.
The exact time depends on the next budget, which is currently unknown.
If it were proven that the situation would change in the field of politics, politicians would be ready to save more, and this could be shifted to 2010.
But I don’t expect that change,” he said.
Rising Debts
The public debt is the debt of the central government, which is primarily formed by accumulating the deficits of the state budget.
Public debt is financed by treasury bills, government bonds, direct loans, or loans from the European Investment Bank, for example.
So far this year, the state’s internal indebtedness has increased by 38.5 billion kroons to 719.4 billion kroons.
The state’s foreign debt has so far increased by 1.7 billion kroons to 123.3 billion kroons.
The so-called marketable public debt reached 803.3 billion kroons at the end of September and decreased by 13.7 billion kroons from June.
The average maturity of public debt increased to 6.5 years.
“Full-year debt increased by 13 percent in the first quarter, which is actually quite a lot compared to the economy’s progress.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated by loan bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is increasing, but on the other hand it shows that there will be something to trade when the pension reform is here,” Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the management of the public debt in 2007 show that the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion kroons this year.
However, by the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion crowns due to better development of the state budget.
This amount is mainly due to the state budget deficit, which is likely to reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the assumed 91.3 billion crowns.
In addition, the planned financing of the Czech Consolidation Agency for a maximum of 13.3 billion kroons, the provision of 10 billion kroons for the payment of pensions, the financing of 43 billion kroons of government bonds and the repayment of loans from the European Investment Bank worth 1.8 billion kroons.
Teacher Appears Today In Court In Khartoum For A Name Given To A Plush Bear
A court in Khartoum on Thursday evening sentenced the British teacher to 15 days in prison and expulsion from the country for insulting Islam, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of allowing her six- to seven-year-old students to name a teddy bear Muhammad, but Islam forbids any depiction of her prophet.
Such an act is punishable by flogging.
The 54-year-old British woman, a teacher at Unity High School in Khartoum, was arrested in her own apartment on Sunday. Under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, she was accused of violating Islam and rebelling after the students’ parents repeatedly complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Education about her.
The story began in September, when the teacher asked her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy bear.
“The children proposed a total of eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” said the school’s principal, Robert Boulos.
Finally, by voting, 20 out of 23 children chose the given name Muhammad.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic prophet, but he is also a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then made a diary with a photo of the teddy bear and the caption "My name is Muhammad".
Rather, the problem lies in the fact that any depiction of the Prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
A Muslim colleague of Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school, said she knew him well and that the teacher would never have done anything to offend any religious belief. She said it was just an "innocent mistake": "I'm only sorry that she had the children vote for the name."
Many of the teacher's students agree with this view, saying that she "treats children very well" and "never talks about religion in class".
Remember that Muhammad is also the second most popular first name in Britain and has 14 different spellings in English.
This first name, so often chosen by Muslim families, is a way of expressing respect for the prophet (often given to the family’s first-born child).
What are the rules for using a first name?
Can a game, for example, get that name?
This is obviously a matter of interpretation.
No agreement was reached on the future status of the province at the last meeting in Vienna on Wednesday.
The end result: failure.
The sixth and last meeting between Serbs and Kosovar Albanians on the future status of the separatist province ended without a rapprochement on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria.
“It is regrettable that the parties have not reached an agreement on the status,” EU diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger told a press conference in Vienna.
US Ambassador Frank Wisner stressed that peace in the region is “at stake” and urged Belgrade and Pristina to keep their promises to maintain peace and dialogue after the talks.
“There is no need to fear violence in the near future, but it is going to be a very difficult time,” he added, stressing “the existence of obvious tensions”.
The broadcast ends on December 10.
On Monday, the European Union, the United States and Russia will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time.
Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Bocan-Harchenko will submit their report to the United Nations Security Council by December 10.
The meeting in Baden, near Vienna, was the sixth and final meeting of the talks since the UN mandated the troika to mediate again last August.
Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation task will be completed on December 10.
The Russians, who have already thwarted Kosovo’s independence in the Security Council, insist that negotiations continue beyond the deadline.
“Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise,” Bocan-Harchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of UN control over Kosovo, the Western powers believe that EU-controlled independence is the only viable solution.
Pristina said it was ready to unilaterally declare its independence if the Security Council did not decide in its favour.
Belgrade would continue to support greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not been able to reach an agreement," said Fatmir Sejdiu, the president of the independent province of Kosovo, at a hotel in Baden, where talks on "last chance" had been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, a former commander of the Kosovo Uprising and a future prime minister of the province, also expressed regret.
He added, however, that Belgrade’s idea of autonomy “would be a continuation of the past, which led to murders and deportations”.
"Domino effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic believed that a compromise was still possible and warned the Kosovo Albanian majority about the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence.
Belgrade is afraid of a “domino effect” in the region, which is still unstable due to the independence wars of the 1990s.
“For Serbia, this does not exclude the possibility of a compromise,” Tadic said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation reiterated that the decision should be solely the responsibility of the Security Council, where its Russian ally has the right of veto.
"Kosovo parliament will have the last word."
"For Serbia, only the solution approved by the Security Council is acceptable," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
"The negotiations lasted two years.
They must end where they began: in the Security Council.”
Fatmir Sejdiu told reporters that “the parliament of Kosovo will have the last word”, adding that the unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians is based on “negotiation” with the Western powers.
Bush calls for agreement between Israel and Palestine
On Tuesday, at the inauguration of an international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, President George Bush announced that Israel and Palestine had finally agreed to sign a joint declaration.
Bush said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately begin negotiations to settle the 60-year-old dispute between their peoples.
In the presence of the two presidents, Bush promised to support them in every way possible to sign the “peace treaty” in 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must dismantle “terrorist networks” and Israel must stop its colonial activities, Bush said, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the “peace roadmap” adopted in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the aim of the negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and Israel led by Abbas was “to sign a peace treaty that will resolve all pending issues, including central issues.”
The latter concern three sensitive issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian debate: the future borders of Palestine, the situation in Jerusalem, and the fate of the Arab refugees displaced from their homes during the 1948 conflict, who lived in what is now the state of Israel.
Abbas, who spoke after the US president, insisted that future talks should be “global and in-depth” and touch on all areas of regulation, such as “Jerusalem, asylum, borders, colonies, water and security.”
Olmert, who then took the stage, promised that future negotiations would be “direct and continuous” and that he would strive to “finalise them by the end of 2008.”
By the end of 2008, Bush had set the goal of achieving the “vision of two states” between Israel and Palestine.
Saudi Arabia said it had received a promise from Bush to do so before deciding to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia (whose participation in Annapolis was declared a success by Washington), with the support of all the Arab countries, initiated a plan that would guarantee peace to Israel in exchange for withdrawing from all Arab territories captured during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents “a path of choice in the history of the Middle East, especially because it captures the problem at its root and focuses on the central issues,” the Saudi prince said in an interview with the Saudi-owned Arab newspaper.
Prosecutors say the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is usually the case with this type of news, the official position and the rumor contradict each other.
How did the accident happen?
According to the first data of an investigation launched by the General Inspectorate of the National Police (IGPN), on Sunday, a few minutes after 5 p.m., a police car was driving along the Louise-Michel street in Villiers-le-Bel.
“The car was patrolling, so it wasn’t in action. It was going 40-50 km/h without sirens,” a police source said.
The two young people without a helmet "at high speed" drove a green, "not on the official register, so it can not be used in road traffic" (see below) with an engine of the brand Kawasaki.
“Because they didn’t follow the right-hand rule, the engine hit the left side of the police car,” a police officer said.
The result of the alcohol test on the passengers was negative.
The strength of the impact is demonstrated by the fact that the front of the car is dented, the windshield is cracked in the shape of a star, and the bumper is torn off.
Pontoise's state prosecutor, Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se de Givry, said in an extraordinary announcement yesterday morning that he had commissioned the IGPN and the Val-D'Oise County Public Security Directorate to investigate "a failure to commit murder and provide assistance as a result of negligence."
During the afternoon, the prosecutor told a press conference that at the current stage of the IGPN investigation, the responsibility of the police could be excluded.
According to the prosecutor, three witnesses to the accident, who were interviewed on Sunday evening, confirmed “the police report that the scooter arrived relatively quickly from the left side of the police car.”
Yesterday, a strip that was no doubt pulled by the footrests on the roadway showed that the two vehicles collided and drove together for a while until the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles were impounded for roadworthiness testing.
The bodies of the two victims were examined by a medical examiner yesterday.
What happened immediately after that?
Yesterday, rumours spread in Villiers-le-Bel that police officers quickly left the scene without providing assistance to the two young people.
The IGPN said it was cautious, but ruled out any “serious mistake” by the police.
“This is the most difficult part of the investigation, which requires even more thorough investigation and increased caution,” a police source said.
The Libération met with a witness who told them about the few minutes after the accident.
One of the windows of your apartment looks directly at the location.
“With my cousin, who is a hospital nurse, we immediately went down to try to resuscitate them,” the witness said.
"There was nothing we could do."
Then he noticed "a policeman who was completely disoriented and limping.
The other two tried to resuscitate one of the young people, and the fourth called.”
Tensions escalated among those present as the desperate situation of the two young people became apparent, so the police officers took their colleagues away from the scene by car.
We also know from the witness that the ambulance arrived "about 20 minutes after the police left".
CPR was also used, but to no avail.
“I wouldn’t say the police didn’t try to help the young people.
Young people have been helped.
Firefighters arrived at the scene immediately.
They did everything they could to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tensions rise in Pakistan
On Monday, police in Pakistan blocked the first demonstrations after the state of emergency imposed by General Musharraf two days earlier.
Eyewitnesses say about 2,000 lawyers in the eastern city of Lahore have been wounded by tear gas bombs used by law enforcement to protest the state of emergency.
They responded by throwing stones at police officers, many of whom were injured.
At least 350 lawyers were hired.
Similar incidents took place in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and wounded lawyers.
More people were produced.
In Islamabad, registered lawyers for the Supreme Court called for a general strike and announced protests over the arrest of some 500 opposition members, human rights fighters and lawyers over the weekend.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the assembly.
There were also several demonstrations in Multan in the central part of the country and in Peshawar in the northwest.
Since Monday, the lawyers’ movement has also been supported by the powerful alliance of religious parties called Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose leader “encouraged the people to send flowers to judges who disagree with the state of emergency and trash to those who swore an oath before Musharraf.”
"Musarraf's promise is no longer valid."
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the exceptional measure announced on Saturday evening.
The Court will have to rule on the legality of President Musharraf’s re-election on 6 October by indirect vote in the coming days.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed from office and replaced.
“All that we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to Supreme Court decisions,” he told The News.
President Pervez Musharraf’s promise to step down from the military to assume the role of civilian president was “outlawed” after the state of emergency was imposed, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem announced on Monday.
Musharraf had to leave his military uniform by November 15, the end of his first term as president.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed the news of the postponement of the January elections.
Pakistan’s government has denied rumors that President Musharraf was forced to have a second-in-command.
More than a third of pregnancies are unplanned
This result includes unwanted (24%) or improperly or unplanned pregnancies.
More than a third (36%) of pregnancies are still unplanned, according to a study by the French National Institute of Demography (Ined), 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth law liberalizing contraception.
This result includes unwanted (24%) or improperly or unplanned pregnancies.
Ined estimates that contraceptive methods, such as the pill or the bee spiral, still fail in 5-6% of cases.
However, according to the institute, the liberalization of contraception has made "birth control" more effective. The study notes that in 1970, only 5% of women between the ages of 20 and 44 took the contraceptive pill, but today this proportion is now 60%.
Today, 8 out of 10 pregnancies are planned.
One in five plan with a few months of accuracy, and if possible, by spring, since this is the most favorable season for receiving a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) had to work more than seven hours in space to carry out a spectacular repair of the broken solar panel, which is essential for the station’s scientific activities.
This dangerous spacewalk proved to be a record in several ways: the repair took a very long time, there was very little time to design it, and it had to be done away from the residential modules with tools "made" by the astronauts.
The problem occurred on Tuesday when the astronauts separated the Harmony module from Discovery. It is a giant cylindrical element that will soon be the site of scientific laboratory activities in Europe and Japan (see box).
This module is a kind of gateway to laboratory modules.
However, you need to take care of your electricity supply.
The second task of the crew was therefore to relocate one of the modules, which was already on the ISS, to its final location to produce electricity with the help of the 17.5-tonne solar panels.
The crew then began to open the module's 76-meter-wide solar panels.
At this time, one of the accordion-like folding boards was violated by a blocked cable in a length of about 1 meter.
To avoid further injury, the board was not continued to be opened.
Astronauts were originally tasked with taking a control walk from the space shuttle Discovery and then repairing another solar panel with a faulty rotation system. Instead, they had to devote all their time to repairing the damaged solar panel.
Scott Parazynski was chosen to perform the stunt by hanging from the space shuttle’s 30-metre robotic arm attached to the station’s crane.
He's one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
He is tall, strong, extremely skilful, has a muscular upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old, doctor-educated man had to operate the "damaged" solar panel.
After carefully assessing the damage, he cut the faulty cable and fixed the damaged area with a few "rails".
He was assisted in his work by another "spacewalker" who stayed near the safe passageway, as well as other astronauts from inside, including the crew captain Peggy Whitson.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey stick insulated against hundreds of volts of voltage on solar panels, was created and “made” by the station’s astronauts.
After completing the operation, Scott Parazynski waited until his companions opened the board completely, and only then packed his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took a half-day rest, and then today, seven of them returned to the space shuttle Discovery to begin their planned return home on Wednesday.
Decrease in EADS share price
The price of EADS shares fell sharply on the Paris Stock Exchange after the aircraft and defense equipment manufacturer announced that the delay in the development of the A400M aircraft will result in additional costs of 1.2-1.4 billion euros.
EADS shares, after a 4% decline, currently stand at €21.96.
The company was forced to revise its 2007 operating profit forecasts due to delays in the development of the A400M engine, which obviously delayed the delivery of the aircraft.
The delay in the delivery of the tactical transport aircraft, announced in October, "will cost between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than EUR 1 billion will affect Airbus", the parent company of the European EADS manufacturing company announced.
Because of these expenses, EADS will have to provide new planned figures for its 2007 operating profit next Thursday when it announces its quarterly results, the company added, but did not provide additional figures.
The group also indicated that the six-month delay was taken into account when preparing its new cost estimate.
In 2006, EADS’ operating profit declined by 86%, largely due to delays in the development of another program, the A380, which also placed a heavy financial burden on the company.
The company originally planned to deliver the A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
Remains a status quo
Sunday’s elections are not a big surprise: a large majority of Russians will vote for Putin’s party, United Russia.
This shows the Russians’ need for stability, a kind of arbitrary government, after a powerfully manipulated campaign.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks to voters via public service channels in a televised message, which has already been recorded, but its content is still secret.
Putin is the leader of the pro-Kremlin party, United Russia, which is expected to win a landslide election.
At the reception of the foreign ambassadors yesterday, the behavior of the head of state did not reveal anything: he only made another outburst against the interventions of Western countries, which was his favorite topic during the campaign.
“We know the cost of true democracy, and we want honest, absolutely transparent and open elections, with no violations of any kind,” he said.
However, according to the opposition, this is not the case.
The opposition condemns the campaign, which they say put pressure on the electorate.
The leader of the Communist Party, Gennady Zyuganov, says that "there was no such dirty election in Russia even in Yeltsin's time".
After the crackdown on last weekend’s protests, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov was sentenced to five days in jail for an unauthorized protest, and his lawyer says he is still not allowed to visit.
"The Russians still think of it as 'homo sovieticus'."
Predictable election results raise two even more obvious questions:
Who is going to follow Putin in the head of state?
The date of the first round of the presidential election, which will be March 2, 2008, was published in the official newspaper yesterday, and candidates can indicate their intention to stand until December 23.
Since Vladimir Putin was elected in 2000 and 2004, his mandate can no longer be extended.
There is no other successor in sight.
What role will Putin play from March?
Will he be Prime Minister?
Or will he, as the leader of the all-powerful United Russia Party or the parliamentary majority, decide the government and the president?
Whatever happens, the outgoing government will win both the parliamentary and presidential elections.
This has now become a tradition.
“Russians still think like ‘homo sovieticus’: they don’t feel they can control their destiny,” said Lev Gudkov, a sociologist and director of the independent Levada center.
Nikolai Koposov, the historian of the St. Petersburg University, goes even further: according to his theory, the country became Christian five hundred years later than Europe, so the development of civil society is also delayed.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin went back to the paternalist model, which was perfectly suited to the people, all the more so because this new paternalism was not accompanied by intimidation, but by a certain level of economic prosperity," says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians are "voluntarily rejecting personal responsibility", which quickly manifested itself after the break-up of the Soviet Union.
"Why should we think?"
This phenomenon affects all levels of society, including the business world.
The administrative elite is interested in maintaining the current situation: the local lists of Unified Russia are headed by 65 governors, who are from the leaders of 85 Russian regions.
And freedom imported from the West often embodies chaos, as it did in the 1990s.
The public has a preference for stability.
Russia does not vote for extremist parties.
Tamara Cheredchenko, a 54-year-old teacher, concludes: "Why should we think?
Those in power are not so bad, so why should we replace them?”
Depressing Memories
After more than 60 years of secrecy, the Bad Arolsen archive, which documents the fate of 17 and a half million victims of the Hitler regime, has been made public.
The 47 million archival documents, which occupy 27 kilometres of shelves in Bad Arolsen in the Hessen province, have so far only been searchable for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. providing only unique and anonymous access to the victims or their descendants.
In May 2006, the eleven states that manage the archives, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed to open the archive to researchers and historians.
After all the states ratified the treaty, the archive was opened yesterday.
Confidential information
The opening of the archives in Bad Arolsen allows historians to conduct research on “the relocation of prisoners, the residents of the camps and the state of health of the forced laborers,” explains Reto Meistern, director of the archive managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Until now, several states, including Germany, have opposed the disclosure of the documents because they contain names and thus confidential information.
These include, for example, the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some deported victims.
The lists of concentration camps and the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo began to be collected after the war for practical reasons, the purpose being to search for civilians who had been deported or sentenced to forced labour, and possibly to provide evidence of their internment, on the basis of which they could receive compensation.
In Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees are already processing tens of thousands of individual needs.
However, some members of the scientific community do not consider the opening of the Bad Arolsen archive to be of paramount importance.
“These documents basically contain nothing new,” said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the research center for antisemitism at the Technical University of Berlin.
EU-India Free Trade Agreement to be signed in 2008
The annual turnover of Indo-European bilateral trade is already approaching 60 billion euros.
The EU is India's number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and Indian Trade Minister Kamal Nath.
EU foreign ministers approved in April last year the European Commission to open negotiations on free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The annual turnover of Indo-European bilateral trade is already close to EUR 60 billion.
The EU is India's number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also India’s main foreign investor, but India is only the EU’s ninth most important trading partner, according to European Commission figures.
Peter Mandelson explained that “a free trade agreement can be an economic stimulus for both sides” and that “India could thus increase its presence in a thriving market of 450 million people.”
For the top ten products exported by India, Europe is the primary or secondary importer - added the European Commissioner. The two giants, Europe and Asia exchange with each other every year "a product worth 47 billion euros" and "a service worth 10 billion euros" - stated Prime Minister of India Dani<0xC3><0xA8>le Smadja, the head of the European Commission delegation to the meeting held on Friday in New Delhi. At the same time, he expressed his regret over the "bilateral trade"

Bank of England to Offer <0xC2><0xA3>10 Billion to Financial Markets for Five Weeks
In an effort to ease concerns about credit conditions, the Bank of England announced on Thursday that it would pump <0xC2><0xA3>10bn into the money market, with a base rate of 5.75% and an unusual five-week maturity.
“We would like to allay concerns that money market conditions will be particularly bad at the end of the year, and we would like banks to be able to plan their liquidity positions in a more secure manner for this period. Therefore, the Bank will offer a significant part of its reserves on the international financial market from 6 December through a five-week open market operation,” the bank said in a press release.
According to the bank, <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion (€14 billion) will go on sale on 6 December at 12:15 p.m. local time. The offer is subject to the central bank base rate and the repayment deadline is 10 January.
This is the first time that the Bank of England has issued liquid funds for five weeks in an open market operation.
The duration of such operations is usually one week.
In a press release, the Bank of England said it was “ready to take further measures” to align interbank loans with the central bank base rate.
The current interbank interest rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate was above the level of 18 September: it is now at 6.6%.
Since the beginning of the summer financial market crisis, the Bank of England has charged significant punitive interest on the sums pumped into the financial market, which has deterred banks from using them.
According to the rumours (which are reinforced by the development of the pound against the euro), many would have been more pleased with the resources offered by the European Central Bank, which they could have obtained at a more favourable interest rate and with greater discretion.
UMP and NC Refuse to Examine Socialist Proposal on Purchasing Power
The UMP and the Nouveau Centre group on Thursday refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is tantamount to rejecting the text itself.
The text discussed at the meeting, initiated by the Socialists, contained about ten measures adopted on Tuesday by the National Bureau of the Socialist Party, such as a 50% increase in the employment supplement, the reintroduction of variable fuel tax, the introduction of travellers' cheques and restrictions on rents.
As the UMP and NC voted 180:115 against the articles being examined, the sometimes heated discussions between the governing party and the opposition finally came to a halt, just hours before President Nicolas Sarkozy’s televised speech on purchasing power.
The leader of the Socialist delegation, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that he would resubmit all of his group’s proposals in the framework of the amendment of the amending financial bill, which will be on the agenda of the National Assembly next week.
A new festival is born
There have been a lot of rumors about a new music festival in Philadelphia, organized by C3 Presents, but now the company that organizes and promotes the event has announced that Melvin Benn, a British producer with his company, Festival Republic, will host the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey.
“We’re honored to be working with someone who is the instigator of today’s American festival movement,” Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.
C3 also organizes the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The Vineland Festival in New Jersey is held in the summer, so you can camp there.
The festival will take place from August 8 to 10, on a 500-acre private property about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Festival Republic director Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the most respected festival organizers in the world.
In 1989, he began organizing the British Reading Festival, which attracts around 80,000 visitors each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn expanded his repertoire with the Leeds Festival, and in 2006 the Festival Republic launched the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been a co-owner of the Glastonbury Festival, which now has a capacity of 177,500.
C3’s Charlie Jones called Glastonbury Festival the “most inspiring event” he has ever attended, adding that his company and Melvin Benn’s company are working in parallel to enrich the region with a European-style festival event.
“The Philadelphia venue has been selected before and we have worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Committee to host this festival in the center of Philadelphia,” said Charlie Jones.
"We have had discussions with the city and the Commission has shown great enthusiasm for our plan.
“Unfortunately, the city administration’s political maneuvers have failed,” said Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we were able to talk to Melvin Benn about this, and now we are preparing to host a huge festival at another, unique venue that will ultimately serve the interests of the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago’s Grant Park in 2005, after demonstrating its exceptional festival-organizing talent in 2002 with the Austin City Limits music festival.
The two events had gross revenues of $9.8 million and $11.3 million, respectively, in 2007.
Both festivals were held in the city.
“Melvin Benn’s European concept is based on a rural festival, while our festivals usually take place in urban green areas,” says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine the two models in some way, creating both a European rural atmosphere and a familiar urban feeling in America.”
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The people of Vineland, and even the mayor himself, are enthusiastic about supporting the event,” says Charlie Jones.
Although he does not discuss the details of the agreement, he says that “the conditions are favourable enough to allow an investment in such a large event at a venue that will hopefully host the festival for a long time to come.”
According to Charlie Jones, the festival will be “giant” in size, with a capacity roughly equivalent to the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee’s capacity of 80,000.
The bands have already been invited to the event, but nothing is final at the time of the press release.
“Vineland is basically going to be a rock festival, but we’re planning a diverse music offering so that everyone can find what they want in it,” says Charlie Jones.
Jones and his two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles Attal, form the C3 company, which was named "Best Independent Event Organizer" at the recent Billboard Touring Awards.
Montreal takes on the Terminator
It’s not easy to lure Hollywood directors to Montreal when you’re battling the Terminator himself.
"Attraction" is one of the tasks of the delegate from Montreal.
The mission promises to be “politically difficult” as California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger opposes filming his own productions abroad.
Is it really hard to fight the "Governor Terminator"?
“We have to be careful because the film industry decides for itself which is the best location for it.
If you find that conditions in Montreal are favorable, you will go there.
Our job is to offer the best possible conditions on which they will decide for us,” says Schwarzenegger.
Competition for Festivals
However, Denis Turcotte is now mostly focused on promoting Canadian films.
The competition for the Oscars has begun.
The goal is to present and promote as many Québec films as possible at every American film festival, be it the Sundance Film Festival, the Denver, Seattle or San Francisco Film Festival.
The film L'<0xC3><0x82>ge des tén<0xC3><0xA8>bres received a favorable reception a few weeks ago at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
It will also be screened at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil will be screened in Santa Monica and at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec was also represented with four short films and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock exchange? Experts share the opinion of the "subprime" crisis
Just five weeks before the end of the fiscal year, investors are already rubbing their hands and looking forward to the usual year-end rush.
This year, however, it is not clear to experts whether this will actually happen.
According to Banif, “Statistically speaking, in December, the stock market generally behaves positively.
However, forecasts based solely on statistics are not necessarily correct and, in the current situation, the market is characterised by uncertainty, at least in the short term."
The experts are not in favour of a stock market swing at the end of the year, although they state that "the stock market is sustained by the presence of liquidity, which provides an opportunity for investment, as there is a lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially a fixed yield, which is negatively affected by the flight towards quality securities, both in the long and short term."
For this reason, the stock exchange will be characterised by a lateral movement that is not devoid of volatility, “especially as the impact of the reduction in the Fed’s interest rate is still unknown, as the price of crude oil is high and inflationary tensions are also threatened.”
Javier Barrio, BPI’s sales manager in Spain, agrees, so it would be risky to say that there will be a rally.
According to the expert, "the situation is not at all rosy."
Ibex posted a loss of nearly 4 percent compared to its highest level recorded on November 8, when the index closed at 15.945,7 points.
Despite all this, not all experts are so pessimistic.
According to Intermoney analyst Juan Solana, Ibex 35 may close the year closer to 16,000 points due to the reorganization of portfolios and contributions to the regular pension fund at that time.
On the other hand, the expert adds that some changes are expected this year, as the rally will be postponed to the second week of December, after the long weekend of the Constitution Day.
The analyst considers it unlikely that volatility would influence market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, analyst at Inversis Banco, we are close to the technical level and are therefore experiencing a decline in the stock market index, which may even increase depending on news from the US regarding the consequences of the credit market crisis.
The analyst is confident that these will be favorable.
Analysts agree on what will be the securities aimed at achieving the new maximum quotas of Ibex.
Solana, from Intermoney, emphasizes that “this year it’s time for the big securities”.
The expert would add the two big banks and some construction companies to the list, “because by then the electricity sector will be very expensive.”
Federico Olucha from Inversis Banco states that the rise is due to the banking sector and the industrial sector.
For construction companies, rallying can also be a positive, if at all.
“The ACS has been trying to regain its positions for several months and we hope that both Ferrovial and the FCC construction companies will follow suit,” he said.
Cyclical consumption will be the main driver for the rest of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
On the other hand, according to the expert, technology companies can also benefit, although they are not very well represented on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, there have only been two falls in the December exchange rate.
The real year-end rally was observed in 2003, when the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the bursting of the technological bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 corrected back 28.17%, a jump of 6.68% was recorded in December.
So it is still open whether 2007 will be the fifth consecutive profitable year (Ibex is currently showing an increase of 8.36% since January) and whether the final rally could take place.
Banco Popular Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ol 200 opens a 12-hour account Monday through Saturday
Banco Popular Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ol has decided to renovate most of its branches.
This will affect a total of 200 branches in the most commercially affected parts of Spain.
These accounts are called Popular Max and make a big difference for the bank.
But also for the other Spanish institutions, as this is the first group, whose branches are open from 10 a.m. to 8.30 p.m., and even on Saturdays, from 10 a.m. to 8.30 p.m.
The other group, BBVA, which has also repeatedly stated that it plans to extend the opening hours of its accounts, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
But he's just about to make a deal with the unions that he would close 75% of his accounts in exchange for an afternoon opening, though not to the public.
The experience of Banco Popular Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ol will be crucial for other institutions to decide whether to join the initiative to promote better store openings.
This is the objective of the Banco Popular Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ol project.
The aim is to target individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, self-employed people and local businesses shopping in these locations.
The bank would like to operate 200 branches across Spain for 18 months with the above-mentioned opening hours, because it is not a new opening hours, but a modification of the existing ones.
To do this, the institution modernizes its branches in the commercial zones according to the needs of the customers of each street.
In this way, the extension of the opening hours is accompanied by a new idea of the nature of the drawers, a more modern, more colorful design.
<0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, who is in charge of the commercial banks, points out that the restructuring does not require a large investment, but requires more employees, meaning eight or nine employees per branch, instead of the current six.
The branches, which even include meeting rooms for SMEs, will also sell non-financial products.
Favourable experiences
Banco Popular Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ol has already implemented the initiative in its three branches in Madrid.
According to <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero, the experience was positive.
The drawers on the streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a in Madrid were chosen, and Rivero said the decision was the right one.
Banco Popular Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ol currently has 2,500 accounts.
Another 60 operate under the name Mundocredit, specializing in immigrants, and also have a very favorable opening schedule, opening even on Sundays and holidays.
The said units of PopularMax do not use the BBVA model, where some branches offer a wide range of non-financial products.
“We don’t want to create competition for our customers,” Rivero points out.
At the moment, an agreement has been reached with Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica and mobile phones will be sold using external personnel.
Telecinco doubles stock market value of rival Antena 3 for the first time
"We did it."
Paolo Vasile, a consultant for Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction with the closing of the market yesterday when it was revealed that the TV channel he runs doubled the value of his rival Antena 3.
But one thing overshadowed his joy: “It only hurts that it’s not because we’ve risen more, but because we’ve fallen less.”
Even so, he stressed that in a weak market “we fell less”.
Telecinco closed yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This increase puts your annual loss at 15.66 percent.
Mediaset owns 52% of the company and Vocento owns 13% of the company, making it worth €4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg.
His rival, Antena 3, lost 1.52 percent yesterday and has fallen 40.5 percent since January, so yesterday it was worth half that, 2,193.46 million.
The other listed communications companies are worth 3.571 million for Sogecable, 2.518,53 million for Prisa (publisher of Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as) and 1.779 million for Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to the similarity between the two companies.
The only question is how much we can deliver on the same market, at what cost, and how we can make a profit in terms of ratings.
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first TV channel to exceed $1 billion in gross advertising revenue this year, said Giuseppe Tringali, acting advisor to Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the group’s advertising subsidiary.
If the announced fact is realised, the TV channel would increase its advertising revenues by 3.6% in this financial year compared to the 965.4 million recorded in the 2006 financial year.
Net sales of Antena 3 increased by 1.6 percent in the first nine months of the financial year (to 734.4 million), while television net sales increased by 0.7 percent (630.4 million).
According to analysts, one of the factors that triggered Telecinco’s stock market momentum is the high pay out that has been maintained so far: in 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a distributed 100% of its profits to its shareholders.
According to Vasile, although it is too early to decide, this ratio may change after acquiring 33% of Endemol in partnership with its parent company, Mediaset.
"We officially guarantee a minimum payout of 50%, although we have always distributed much more.
I hope our shareholders will be satisfied with us this year, as we have already favoured them with the acquisition of 33% of Endemol.”
According to analysts, the market is currently experiencing some slack.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its yield estimates for Telecinco by 4 percent in 2008 and 7 percent in 2009.
According to them, this is due to the fact that the estimated increase in sales revenue will decrease from 10.5 percent to 8.4 percent in 2008 and from 5.5 percent to 5.1 percent in 2009.
According to the same company, Antena 3’s profits are expected to decline by 4.5 percent in 2008 and 7.5 percent in 2009.

Congress approves takeover of MiFID, which took effect on November 1
In parallel with parliamentary proceedings, which ended today with a vote in Congress approving the Senate amendments, the government has initiated a social dialogue on the underlying legislation so that both can enter into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of the various groups unanimously highlighted the efforts of representatives and senators in negotiations and agreements, which served to develop the most favourable normative for protecting investors, as well as the detailed regulation of the companies’ activities in order to ensure efficient market operation.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Markets Act, will allow for the modernisation of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, broadening the supervisory powers of the Spanish National Securities Markets Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between different supervisors in the European Union.
The new directive will allow financial advisory services to be provided to specialised firms, but also to natural or legal persons, and will create a new form of financial services company (ESIS), namely financial advisory companies (AFI), in addition to securities trading companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the Act increases the number of systems capable of executing operations involving funds, thus adding to the regulated secondary markets the multilateral trading platforms and the internalisation systems for the execution of orders, which are in competition with the current stock exchange participants.
In addition, the Act requires investment service providers to provide market information on the determining aspects of their business profile, risk-taking and risk management methods, and to keep a record of all operations carried out in order to facilitate control of the CNMV.
The Congressional Economic Commission has introduced a number of amendments. Of particular importance is that securitised debt is treated as a “complex” asset because of its high risk to the investor. This has been proven in connection with US high-risk mortgage lending (subprime).
On the other hand, the transposition of the directive was also used to legally outline the range of activities of those with economic and entrepreneurial qualifications, 30 years after the Royal Decree defining professional functions that can only be carried out by economists came into force in 1977.
And the Senate has proposed the creation of new players in the financial sector, such as an intermediary agent who works for someone else’s account, does not need CNMV’s permission, and can sell products or acquire clients to several investment companies at the same time.
The Consumer Price Index increased by 0.5 points in November, reaching 4.1%.
This indicator, taken into account by Eurostat for the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, shows the evolution of prices in Spain for the month of November.
Its publication is in line with the strategy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank to provide data that are comparable with data from the United States, both in terms of time of production and nature.
For the preliminary indicator, the same calculation method is used as for the calculation of the Harmonised Price Index, but the statistical modelling method differs in estimating the information that is not yet available at the time of disclosure.
The Statistical Office pointed out that the preliminary indicator is purely indicative and therefore may differ from the final data, which will be published on 14 December.
"The Consumer Price Index remains relatively high."
Pedro Solbes, a vice-president of the government and Minister of Economic Affairs, said that the increase in the Consumer Price Index to 4.1% in November was only "temporary in nature", but at the same time predicted that the price index is expected to remain "relatively high" in the coming months.
In Parliament's corridors, Solbes confirmed that "although the indicator is not very favourable", the inflation rate in Spain within the monetary union has remained more or less at the same level in recent years.
He added that the month of November brought “less surprises” than the previous month, when the Government did not expect such a large increase.
"We were expecting a value of around 4%," the Minister of Economic Affairs acknowledged in connection with the data published today.
Through Northern Rock, Virgin aims to raise €42 billion over three years.
Northern Rock’s deposits have fallen by more than 50% and currently stand at just <0xC2><0xA3>12 billion (€16 billion, 800 million) since mid-September, when it was hit by a crisis and had to take an urgent loan from the Bank of England.
At the time, he still had a record number of deposits in excess of <0xC2><0xA3>25 billion, the number of which gradually declined over the past two and a half months due to a loss of customer confidence, despite the fact that the Government had promised the bank a 100% guarantee until the end of the crisis.
Virgin will operate this unit under its own financial and trading name, Virgin Money, which will need to earn about a quarter of the revenues of British banks over the next three years to raise the remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18bn to reach the target of <0xC2><0xA3>30bn.
Richard Branson’s group plans to spend about <0xC2><0xA3>50 million (<0xC2><0xA3>70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week highlighted the offer of the Virgin consortium as the most favorable to avoid bankruptcy. In addition to Virgin, three other companies make up the consortium.
Mayor of Totana arrested over alleged corruption case
The Gendarmerie arrested the mayor of Totana (People’s Party) in the province of Murcia early this morning on suspicion of involvement in the city’s corruption scandal this week.
In addition to him, a secretary of the City Hall and the chief of police of the settlement were arrested.
Former city council member José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo took the place of EPP member Juan Morales in May, who, according to the official authorities interviewed by the SER radio channel, may have been the head of the corruption network.
Police are continuing to investigate the city’s offices and the City Development Council, and it cannot be ruled out that further arrests may be expected.
Juan Morales’ lawyer has also been investigated as the main suspect in the corruption scandal that erupted this week.
According to information from the SER radio station, the EPP lawyer Juan Morales was arrested while leaving Morales with the corruption-related documentation in his bag.
According to police sources, the subject of the investigation is the alleged commission that Morales received in exchange for signing an urban development agreement with a Galician construction company to reclassify 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently under arrest.
Bono accepts the nomination of the PSOE in Toledo and the position of Speaker of Parliament if they win the election.
The former Minister of Defence, José Bono, accepted the offer of the Prime Minister and the Secretary General of the Socialist Party, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, to lead the PSOE's list of candidates in the next parliamentary elections and to assume the position of President of the Parliament if the Socialists win the elections.
This was announced by PSOE’s Secretary of Organization José Blanci at a press conference and confirmed by Bono himself at the party’s federal headquarters this afternoon after talks with Zapatero.
The Prime Minister justified his choice of the former minister by saying that “we have to reckon with the best” in politics, while Bono is “among the best”.
In addition, he added that “probably” the Mancha politician will be the candidate of the Socialist Party for the position of President of Parliament if the Socialists win the upcoming elections.
Bono would replace the current president of parliament, Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n, who announced on 15 November that he did not intend to run in the next elections and would rather give up his political career to fight climate change in scientific circles.
The former minister admitted that the Prime Minister has been constantly besieging him to return to the political arena since he gave up active politics two years ago.
He added that as the voters were aware of who would be the economic vice-president in the event of the Socialists’ victory, the party wanted to inform them about who would be the president of the Parliament in the spirit of “transparency”.
If Bono is indeed to fill the post, he would like the Parliament to be “a place of respect, not insult or shouting” and more like a citizen’s home.
“Unfortunately, at times, it seems that Parliament is the only place in Madrid where you can’t talk quietly, and the Prime Minister’s speech has been interrupted 26 times in the Senate,” he said.
At the same time, he praised the current president, Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n, for his “excellent work”, but he did not want to present himself as president already, lest his opponents consider him to be “exalted”.
Campaign for the climate
Because the climate change movement relentlessly persecutes both those who are skeptical of their predictions and those who prefer political or social battles, it must be very strong.
In fact, he must enlist the support of a political leader such as Prime Minister Zapatero, who says the movement is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism, and proclaims that “we must make a new agreement with our Earth”.
However, this comment raises the question of the extent to which the activity or inactivity of your government has contributed to Spain’s leading position within the Union in non-compliance with the Kyoto Convention.
Who is responsible for non-compliance with the Convention, which sector is affected and why has the Government not sought to avoid it?
It should also clearly explain to the Spaniards what measures it intends to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be affected by these measures, what habits of the population will have to change, what individual and social energy saving should we expect and what economic consequences will this have?
So who has to sacrifice and who has to pay to save our Earth?
But we have not and will not have an explanation for these questions.
This is because it is about sacrifice and money.
Climate change has taken measures, the actual measures are always unpopular.
They are costly, inconvenient and cost both companies and the public.
Even raising the price of gasoline for the PSOE would have been so unpopular before the election that Zapatero quickly withdrew it.
That is, we must save the Earth from nothing, with mere propaganda texts, empty passwords free of real consequences.
Conventions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With the agreement with the Earth, as the Prime Minister says, who speaks so beautifully in the election campaign, he does not demand, he does not attack, he even beautifies the electoral assemblies and awakens tenderness in us.

Mayor and police chief Totana arrested over alleged corruption case
The Gendarmerie has arrested the mayor of the town of Totana in Murca province, the EPP’s José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo, the local police chief, the secretary of the City Hall and a catering entrepreneur for crimes related to urban development, police sources informed today.
The mayor was arrested in his home and then transferred to the City Hall, where he is currently staying with several police officers, many of whom are investigating at the City Development Council and the municipal body responsible for the management of industrial estates and flats.
The three arrests were preceded last Monday by the arrest of six people in Galicia, Madrid and Murcia in a case in which two hectares of agricultural land were reclassified as land to be built up in order to allow the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 apartments after illegally paying commissions to executives during their previous mandates.
Two others have not yet been arrested, but are under investigation, according to the Totana No. 1 Court.
The first six people arrested were handed over to the court.
According to official sources, the former mayor of Totana, Juan Morales, now an independent member of the EPP, is also under investigation.
The former wife, who owns a real estate agency registered in Totana, is also being investigated, as is the current girlfriend of the previous mayor, who lives in the provincial center of Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, Manuel N.A, a lawyer and entrepreneur, was arrested in Nigeria (Pontevedra), along with Pablo José M.G., the director of the Suelo de Inmonuar company, which also belongs to the Nuaria Group and was the source of the bribery.
The investigation is being conducted by the Central Operational Unit of the Gendarmerie, a group charged with crimes committed at the municipal level, whose members, in addition to arrests, have conducted eleven searches, primarily at companies associated with the detainees, which operate in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a well-known poultry product company in the area, who could have played a mediating role in the case.
The Nuaria Group would have created the largest residential complex in Totana, with 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels.
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which was reclassified. The project would have doubled the population of the settlement, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa e Inomonuar, a real estate broker, Coruna in Vigo, Conycase, a car park operator in Venezuela and in the Catholic Ferdinand Square, Hogartel, a direct marketing specialist, and Preconiza, a building element sales, promotion and assembly company.

Our Finnish correspondent found this commentary in one of Finland’s largest daily newspapers: (certainly at the head of the PISA report on the world’s literacy level), in the Helsingin Sanomat, referring to what appeared on November 18, coinciding with the criticism of Blackburn’s book.
"Philosophical teachings came to public attention after the tragedy of Jokela High School.
The killer, a student about to graduate from high school, quoted the writings of Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
Education Councilor Pekka Elo, who is responsible for teaching philosophy, demanded on the pages of Helsingin Sanomat that teachers examine Plato's teachings with a critical eye, and added that Nietzsche's knowledge is not necessarily important in the compulsory basic philosophy classes of secondary schools.

A colleague of yours informs us that there is a criminal offence related to Internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song is considered a misdemeanor and is punishable from six months to a year.
However, stealing a disc worth less than €400 in a store is a violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal €1,000 in a shop, the theft is a criminal offence, but the penalty is still below the penalty for online downloads (Article 234 of the BTK).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty is still below the penalty for downloading online (Article 244.1).
D. You can expect less punishment if you get into a fight than if you copy CDs.
If you participate in a mass brawl, you may be fined from three months to a year (Art. 154 BTK), but for copying the CD, you may be fined from six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the BTK).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the BTK, sexual harassment in the workplace is not as serious as downloading a DVD movie.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without the consent of the authors is punishable more severely than the sale of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).

I got an article from my GP about some strange research: "Money causes brain activity, especially when others have less of it."
That is, the feelings of the employees on the day of payment depend on how much the others received.
The experiment was carried out at the University of Bonn by measuring magnetic resonances by tomography, and the results were published in the latest issue of Science.
Bernd Weber, the lead author of the study and head of the Neurocognition group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany, said: “The strongest activity was measured when the participant answered correctly and the partner made a mistake.”
The researchers found that if they both gave the correct answer and received the same amount of money, brain activity was moderate, but if one of them received double the amount, the activity would also be intensified.
I have no idea why it took so much science to come to such a simple conclusion.
Prosecutor General of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly persecuting war criminals in the Balkans for eight years from the Office of the Prosecutor of the Criminal Court in The Hague, which investigates crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia.
His mandate expires at the end of the year, and Carla leaves with a slightly bitter taste in the mouth, as those responsible for the massacre in Srebrenica, in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were massacred, i.e. General Ratko Mladic and Serbian Bosnian leader Radován Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on a list that Swiss director Marcel Sch<0xC3><0xBC>pbach has chosen as the title of his documentary: Carla's List (2006, not yet released in Spain). The film follows the work of the Swiss Attorney General from Belgrade to New York as he tries to pressure the governments involved to tighten the loop around the fleeing criminals.
What kind of insurance is right for me?
Motor insurance, which provides security for the car owner in the face of various damage events, entails a significant expense and depends on several factors, such as age, gender, date of obtaining a driving license, marital status, type of car to be insured and the type and type of use of the car.
Buying a car is only the first step.
In fact, choosing the right insurance is often more difficult than deciding what kind of car you want.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured.
This agreement takes the form of an insurance contract, which states that the insurance company undertakes to pay compensation in exchange for a fixed insurance premium in the event of an accident.
The insurance premium is basically the amount paid for the insurance, which is determined taking into account various factors, such as age, gender, date of obtaining a driving license, marital status, type of car to be insured, its use, and more.
Insurance companies determine the premium based on statistics, i.e. a higher amount is paid by the person who represents a higher risk of accident.
That’s why women over the age of 25, or women, pay less because statistics show them to be at lower risk because they’re more cautious.
Similarly, on the basis of reports, insurance companies have concluded that married people also cause fewer accidents than lonely people.
The frequency of the use of the car is crucial.
With more frequent use, the possibility of an accident increases.
Many factors are taken into account by insurance companies when setting the premium.
Therefore, the owner should carefully look into it so that he can choose the most appropriate form of insurance for his profile.
In the following, the most important factors for selection are presented in order to best adapt to the needs of the insured and to establish an acceptable price.
When concluding an insurance contract, people under the age of 25 face a number of disadvantages, such as a lack of driving experience and the freshness of their driver’s license.
Although it is ideal to be protected against all dangers, there are also more economical solutions.
More cautious drivers will be able to take out full insurance on their own, thus insuring against all dangers, and the price will also be affordable.
In this type of contract, the insured pays part of the damage.
"The amount of the excess that the insured pays depends on the insurance premium; the higher the premium, the lower the excess," says Luis Noguera, head of First Europa in Spain, the online insurance broker.
Another option is extended third party liability insurance, where the customer insures himself against damage to others, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, you will be insured against theft, fire damage and the loss of the car.
A word of advice.
If you are under the age of 25, be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus and thus reduce the amount you will have to pay in the future.
A bonus is a discount compared to the basic rate of the insurance company.
The penalty charged in relation to the basic rate is called a malus.
"The amount of bonus and malus depends on the insurance company and its profits.
If the company has had a good year, you can afford to raise the bonus rate,” explains Noguera.
Once the 25-year age limit has been exceeded, it is easier for owners to take out adequate insurance, as the risk of accidents is reduced thanks to the experience gained over the years.
We advise you to take out full insurance.
"In general, young people are not yet able to properly apply their experience during an accident, or even when driving," says the director of the European insurance company in Spain, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of driving, when the drivers have already overcome the fear of beginners.
If the insured person is already married but does not have children yet, it is best to take out full insurance, provided that your financial possibilities allow it.
Insurance companies consider married couples with children to be the clients with the lowest risk, so the fee to be paid in their case is also lower.
In this case, it is best to have complete insurance with a self-portrait (this can reach 300 euros), or if they have a higher bonus, from the third year of the car, they can extend the insurance to damage caused to others.
“They drive more relaxed, but also have more purchasing power and can afford to have a higher deductible,” Luis Noguera said.
For pensioners, we recommend full insurance with self-payment (which is around 150 euros), or in the case of a higher bonus, it can be extended to liability insurance.
Car insurance is a very important thing, not only because it provides protection for the owner in the event of an accident, but also because it is a big expense, so it is essential to choose the right form of personal insurance.
Celtic want to score points in Milan to qualify for the eighth round.
Milan and Celtic will compete at the San Siro Stadium on Tuesday to score the missing points at the Champions League closing, allowing the Italians to take the lead and the Scots to qualify.
The Italians have a total of 10 points and have already secured a draw with Portugal in the fifth round, while Celtic have nine points, but it would take another to prevent six-point Shakhtar, who will fight four-point Benfica, from overtaking him.
The two matches of Group D will be played a week before the end of the sixth round, as Milan will play in Japan at the Club World Cup, where they will try to qualify for the 16th round in the semi-final on the 13th.
This will bring Group D to an earlier conclusion than the others, and although the most likely result at Giuseppe Meazza stadium will be a draw, the two teams will strive to win, as the Italians do not want to be left behind at home, and Celtic will be the first to start from a better position in the eighth final.
Even defeat is enough for Gordon Strachan’s team to qualify if Shakhtar doesn’t win, but he can’t be sure, because if there is a point equality, the Ukrainians will advance, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1) but won the next game (2-0).
The Italians will try to make the Scottish evening miserable, who would like to make it to the eighth final of the reorganized Champions League twice in a row, after they lost to Kaka by a goal in the extra time after a 0-0 draw (1-0).
Shakhtar would be most pleased with the victory of the "Rossoneris", because if they lose, Celtic will be in the eighth round and remain in UEFA.
Because Benfica, despite being in last place at the moment and having no chance of remaining in the European Championship, can still get a third place with a win to play in UEFA.
20,000 people went to Vancouver to attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour.
The Spice Girls began their Vancouver, Canada, tour in front of 20,000 fans for the first time since they disbanded in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) announced a few minutes before a gig at GM Place in Vancouver that the band was "in great shape".
Some 20,000 people bought tickets to attend the concert, which featured a video of the band’s huge success in the 1990s.
As the band reunited and toured, EMI also released a new album in Spain, featuring major hits and two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five members of the Spice Girls took to the stage in a bracelet given to them by David Beckham, the husband of the British footballer "Posh Spice".
The athlete was also present at GM Place's crowded auditorium, although she had been banned by Victoria a few days earlier.
Victoria Beckham said that the British football star "hasn't seen our dress yet, so I'm nervous about what she'll think of the show".
'Sporty Spice', was the reason the band broke up two years after leaving the band in 1998 "because the members did not understand each other". He also seemed nervous during the press conference that was held two hours before the concert.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that people's feelings about the Spice Girls had changed.
I thought, why not? Now I'm glad I made that decision," Chisholm said about the band, which had split up nine years earlier because of him.
The singer added that over time, “things have settled down and we love each other very much.”
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed in 1998.
According to CTV, the band arrived in Vancouver on a Virgin Airlines flight.
There was a group of baby-sitters waiting for them at the airport.
The five of them have a total of seven children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform in California (USA), San Jose (4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
The performance will take place in Madrid on 23 December.
Further concerns about the Russian-Ukrainian gas dispute
The gas price dispute between Ukraine and Russia has been renewed, which may also affect Russian fuel to be transported to Western Europe.
Most of the Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) is transported through Ukraine, and the disputes between the two nations are always receiving a great deal of attention.
Kiev has said that if Moscow raises the price of gas paid by Ukrainians, they will also impose higher transit costs on Russia.
An earlier dispute between the two countries last year resulted in a reduction in supplies to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow is between the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned natural gas monopoly Gazprom over an attempt to reach an agreement on the price of gas that Ukraine will pay to Russia in 2008.
Gazprom has stated that it will have to implement a 50% increase in gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan compared to the price agreement with Ukraine for 2008.
According to analysts, this could mean a 40% increase in the price of shipments from Gazprom for Ukraine.
“It is important that during the negotiations, we argue in accordance with one of the most important transit countries for natural gas,” Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinah told Reuters.
“The changes in gas prices should definitely be linked to our discussion on the cost of transit through Ukraine (and into Western Europe),” he said.
As a result of the recent major gas flood between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom shut down the gas pipeline to Ukraine in January 2006.
This resulted in a domino-like decline in exports to Western Europe, which also pushed up prices to a large extent.
A quarter of the EU’s gas supply comes from Russia.
Russia has the largest natural gas reserves in the world, but most of them are still undiscovered.
As a result, Gazprom is supplementing its own gas supply with natural gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet states in Central Asia.
NHS ‘required to check on foreign workers’
Scottish NHS committees should improve criminal records checks for workers from outside Europe, a supervisory body said.
The proposal was put forward by chief accountant Robert Black after a foreign doctor in Scotland was linked to the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that NHS Scotland does not have accurate figures on the number of employees overseas.
At the same time, its report, through a sample of five health authorities, also identified key controls that had been properly implemented.
Following the attack on Glasgow Airport, the chief accountant checked the list of employees recruited outside the European Economic Area.
Bilal Abdullah, a 28-year-old Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep crashed into the main terminal of the building.
Abdullah was one of three doctors who were interrogated by the Old Bailey Court via video link in October on charges of attempted car bombings in the United Kingdom.
NHS committees should check the qualifications and work experience of their overseas employees before they start work, as well as their availability with the necessary permits to work in the UK.
Although the Scottish Health Commissions use Disclosure Scotland to verify criminal records, the agency is not authorized to obtain such information from outside the UK.
Among other things, the report of the Chief Auditor suggested that the committees introduce a guide for the Criminal Records Bureau, which would facilitate the control processes of the employer with the various overseas countries.
“Although we found evidence of such checks in staff records, they are not systematically carried out,” the report states.
According to Black, although the Scottish NHS performs its own pre-employment screening process at a high level, he added: “Our report highlights areas for improvement in the system so that we have up-to-date information on the number of NHS staff coming from overseas.”
Dr Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could be used to identify potential NHS employees who might commit terrorist acts in the future.
“According to the report, the pre-employment checks currently in place in the NHS Scotland are working well and the value of the proposals is not yet transparent,” he added.
According to Scottish health authorities, the current number of their overseas staff, mostly doctors and nurses, is 1,161.
However, the main accountant pointed out that the figures are likely to be higher, which is partly explained by the difficulties the committees have in identifying staff on indefinite leave.
The investigation also showed that the inspection procedures in the Ayrshire and Arran area, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and the NHS authorities in Lothian are largely harmonised.
These procedures included checks on passports, work permits and qualification papers.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing a policy and guidance on pre-employment checks for NHS employees from overseas.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “I am delighted that this mission has been carried out following the attack on Glasgow Airport.
He added that the Scottish Government, in cooperation with the Health Committees, will take into account the proposals in the report and ensure that the up-to-date guidance on pre-employment checks for the entire staff, including those from overseas, reflects best practice. The updated version is planned to be published next month.

The award for Best Actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as David Cronenberg in the London-based crime thriller The Killer Promises.
Ray Winstone, famous for his tough-guy roles, received the Richard Harris Award for Outstanding Contribution to the British Film Industry.
The 50-year-old actor, who has made films such as "Scum", "Ehkoppon" and "Sexy Dog", is currently working on the film "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".
Winstone is proud to receive the award named after the star of "Camelot" and "Harry Potter" Harris, who died in 2002.
“For people like me, people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened the door,” Winstone said.
“I feel really lucky to have had the opportunity to meet Richard Harris several times.
"Richard Harris' style is close to my heart, he was a great actor of his time and I respect him very much."
The selection of independent film awards, known as Bifa, is decided by a group of film directors, actors and festival organisers.
Bifa supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 people arrested in Saudi Arabia over terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia said on Monday it had arrested 208 militants in terrorist cells who were planning to carry out an impending attack on an oil facility and several strikes on clerics and security forces.
According to state television, the world’s largest oil exporter, one of the cells was trying to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda supporters have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
According to a television report, an eight-person cell led by a foreign resident was planning to launch an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province.
Following a 2006 Al-Qaeda-sponsored attack on the world’s largest oil processing facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia began building a 35,000-strong rapid reaction force to protect the facilities.
According to the report, 18 of those arrested belong to a cell led by a “specialist in rocket launches” who crosses the border illegally.
The report also said that the fighters had tried to smuggle eight shells into the kingdom.
Twenty-two of the detainees were planning attacks on church leaders and security forces.
The government has called on church leaders to take tougher action to stem the flow of Saudis joining Al-Qaeda fighters in Iraq who are fighting against the allied forces and the US-backed Shiite Muslim government, which Saudi hardline Sunnis regard as heretical.
Al-Qaida fighters see a significant number of church leaders in Saudi Arabia as being involved by the authorities in supporting the policies of the royal family that governs the government.
The group’s fighters, inspired by the call by Al-Qaeda’s Saudi-born leader, Osama bin Laden, to target the pro-Western Saudi government, have aimed to attack settlements, government buildings and energy facilities that are inhabited by foreigners.
“Security forces have made a tremendous effort in the last... five months,” a Interior Ministry spokesman told state television.
During the arrests in Medina, a 16-member "media cell" was also caught, the purpose of which was to spread "takfir thinking". Takfir thinking is the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which advocates violence against Muslims who are stigmatized as unfaithful and apostate.
The arrests also included 32 people accused of providing financial support to militants.
Venus’ climate could give us a glimpse into Earth’s future
According to scientists, Venus once provided a pleasant living environment.
Data from a European orbiting spacecraft suggests that this planet is more like Earth’s capricious twin than previously thought.
Venus is the Earth’s closest planetary neighbour.
The two planets are nearly the same size and have similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
Scientists now know that billions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions very similar to those on Earth, and even habitable conditions.
However, due to its extremely high CO2 greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation, and the planet’s lower rotational speed, Venus has entered a very different trajectory.
Today, the planet’s water has evaporated, its surface temperature is hot enough to melt the lead, and it is ravaged by hurricane-force winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency’s Venus Express spacecraft, based on a year’s study of the planet, paint a sobering picture of how similar catastrophic climate changes could occur on Earth.
Fred Taylor, Professor of Physics at the University of Oxford, who is also one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "Let's begin to understand why Venus' climate is so different from Earth's, despite the fact that the two planets are very similar in structure.
“With our new data, it became possible to develop a scenario for the formation of Venus billions of years ago, when it could have had habitable conditions similar to Earth.
"Enriched uranium seized by the police"
A kilo of radioactive material - reportedly enriched uranium - was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
According to a police spokesman, three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The spokesman did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said the material could have been sold for $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Wide Open Doors
Mitt Romney says he doesn’t deserve a presidential candidate to answer questions from a snowman.
Republican candidates for the presidential election, however, agreed to participate in a YouTube-streamed debate in which ordinary voters videotaped their questions and forwarded them to the candidates.
None of the questions submitted on Wednesday night on November 28 turned out to be as ridiculous as those of the Snowman, who asked Democrats about global warming in a debate on the other party’s YouTube channel.
However, the questions and answers this time reflected the situation of the Republican Party approaching next year’s election.
It is not yet known exactly how the production managers of CNN, which co-financed the debate, selected the YouTube clips submitted to the candidates.
The longest-running debate in the first half-hour of the debate was on immigration.
This topic is one of the Republicans.
CNN asked some undecided voters to dial a number if they found it appealing: the mediator found an outstanding consensus when the candidates spoke harshly on the issue of borders.
The most intense and long-running dispute was between Rudy Giuliani, a national champion, and Romney, a major contender in the Iowa and New Hampshire primarys.
Giuliani is trying to change the perception that he was too easy on illegal immigration during his time as mayor of New York City.
He accused Romney of hiring illegal immigrants to build his house.
The battle between the two became particularly fierce when the interrogators asked for support for "amnesty" (which would provide illegal immigrants with permanent status and citizenship).
Some candidates with fewer votes, such as Duncan Hunter of California and Tom Tancredo of Colorado, have been able to dig deep into the subject.
And although none of them are considered candidates for the nomination, their stay on the race track may be explained by the fact that they started ringing the bell ringing earlier and louder than the others.
At least on the issue of immigration, there is a broad consensus among the candidates: the common goal is to strengthen the borders and to take tough action against illegal immigrants.
This topic, like the fear of Chinese toxic games and other disturbing factors from the outside world, will help the divisions between libertarians and Christian conservatives be forgotten or minimized within the ranks of Republicans.
However, when other topics came to the fore, the debate escalated very unpleasantly.
Giuliani had to face the question of why he had previously supported arms control.
John McCain and Romney debated whether a simulated drowning should be considered torture.
Another questioner wondered if the candidates believed all the words of the Bible.
Stumbling on this issue, Giuliani eventually clung to the view that, while he considered the Bible his favorite book, he might not interpret the story of Jonah and the whale literally.
Another question was whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
To this, Mike Huckabee, who won the first place in the recent Iowa election and who owed his victory to his tenacious Christian conservatism, reacted to expectations that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When asked if Jesus would receive sufficient support, he laughed and said that Jesus was wiser than he was to run for election.
The competition is unusually open.
Huckabee’s upswing in Iowa coincides with libertarian Ron Paul’s fundraising campaign and the enthusiastic cheers surrounding Wednesday’s debate.
The sudden emergence of the two candidates can be explained by the fact that the two wings of the party have not yet managed to nominate a common candidate from among the more well-known and traditional aspirants.
In 1980 and 2000, there was a candidate who united the party, who sounded the victory message of American greatness in a timely and convincing manner, and who found common ground with both wings of the party.
Now, however, the party is divided, and the consequences of this are as yet incalculable.
Labour's pain
There’s a gap ahead of Gordon Brown; the way out remains the same.
Compared to the British political scandals, this one doesn’t seem too spicy.
No one has sold his honour, no politician has been found with his hotel accounts in Paris, no one has committed an out-of-wedlock scandal.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman, under the name of others, had made a covert contribution of more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3 million) to Britain’s governing Labour Party for more than four years, and that the party had not reported it, was one of the things that Gordon Brown, surrounded by walls, would have been fine without.
Two months ago, when the prime minister got out of office and, by saying that opinion polls had no effect on the outcome of the decision, recklessly questioned the British people's intellectual capacity, people were still hoping that Brown would provide strong and effective governance.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly witty deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, noted, Brown has been transformed from Stalin, once feared, into Mr. Bean.
The failure to save Northern Rock, a bank in need, has exposed regulatory weaknesses and lack of judgment.
The sickening proposals to change the tax law encouraged business interest groups to join forces against the government.
The loss of the personal data of 25 million people by the tax authority revealed an unimaginable level of administrative clumsiness.
In the House of Lords, three retired generals incited sedition against the reduction of the army's budget, stating that the position of Minister of Defense is a part-time occupation.
And now here are the mysterious donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of the Labour Party (former administrative leader) has already resigned.
These accidents don't mean Brown can't turn back on the way out.
At the same time, governments can reach the point where control becomes impossible.
People don't like politicians and don't trust them, but when a new group comes to power, they usually suspend their disbelief.
But as soon as it becomes clear that the prime minister is very likely not fit to move things forward, and perhaps will not remain in office for a long time, the suspended disbelief is over: the civil service will start leaking, cabinet ministers will start giving briefings, the press will look for bad-mouthed news; and the government will become defensive and unable to focus.
In a way, Brown is in a particularly difficult situation, because unlike other political leaders, he is not considered a "fresh blood."
As much as you want to deny your relationship with Tony Blair, he was your right-hand man.
The problems around Northern Rock and tax records, for example, are linked to decisions that Brown made during his time as Secretary of the Treasury.
And while Blair’s missteps — such as the protracted examination of the link between “nobility for money” and political party funding — did not involve him directly, voters can justly assume the opposite.
Although Brown's situation is indeed unpleasant, it is not as embarrassing as it seems.
The mistakes made are not as frightening as the Tories make them out to be.
Like Mr. Bean, no one died, no one was tricked directly.
And compensation, no matter how painful, can be the creation of the trends that Stalin, who lives in Brown, has always promised: reliable, solid, and a little hard-handed governance.
An example of this is political donation.
Abrahams, a Garboian mystic who likens his donation to charity, said he did not want to reveal his good deeds to the public.
Perhaps so, but the decision was not within his competence.
The law prohibiting the anonymity of big political supporters is clear and can be clearly justified: the population has the right to know who is knocking at the door of the country’s rulers.
Watt, who said he was aware of Abrahams’s actions but was not aware of its illegal nature, will likely be sweated during the interrogations, as will Jon Medleson, the head of the Labor Party’s foundation, who learned of the turbulent donations in October.
Brown, on the other hand, is not yet on the hook: there is no indication that he knew about these conundrums, not even that the huge sums of money were paid after Brown took office in June.
So far, the prime minister has done half of the job.
Although he denounced the violation of the law committed by his party, his firmness was diluted by the fact that he used a familiar instrument; he commissioned a committee led by a retired bishop and a judge to investigate the matter, for safety’s sake.
In this story, the "lesson to learn" is not too complicated.
In case of violation of the law, the police are responsible.
In addition, Brown will have to put other things in order, such as the appointment of the chairman of an independent commission on administrative rules, which has been without a leader for six months, or the promotion of effective reform of political party funding.
This would require the hard hat Labour Party to cooperate with the Tories and break with the special financial relations associated with the associations - that would be a hard wall for the party's loyalist, Brown.
But you have to face some facts about the party.
According to polls, conservatives are now leading the charge; Brown has two years to win back voters; the only way to get the victory is through impeccable integrity and strong competence.
Card Sharks
Is the second-market mortgage market crisis threatening America’s credit card market?
When blood gets into the water, it’s natural for sharks to appear nearby.
Now that the U.S. housing market is failing, predators are focusing on the country’s credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe that if the mortgage crisis infects other forms of consumer credit, the credit card market could lose up to $99 billion.
The signs of tension are clearly visible.
There was an increase in both the write-off rate for non-recoverable loans and the default rate for overdue payments over 30 days.
HSBC reported a $1.4 billion loss in the U.S. consumer finance segment last month, in part due to the financial weakness of cardholders.
However, the panic is still too early.
The ratio of write-offs and late payments remains low.
Moody's has a late-payment ratio of 3.89% for the third quarter, which is one full percentage point lower than the historical average.
The decrease in the rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
The change in the US rules on individual insolvency in 2005 has led to a sharp decrease in the number of people filing for insolvency, but at the same time has led to large losses in the credit card market; the number of bankruptcy petitions (and thus the write-off rate) is expected to increase again, regardless of whether the conditions for borrowing as a whole are deteriorating or not.
The payment rate, which shows the ratio of monthly credit repayments to consumers, is also solid in the market.
In addition, confidence in credit card-backed securities is quite strong, despite the paralysis in other areas of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup Research estimates that the volume of emissions in 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The signs of the impact of the mortgage crisis on the credit card market are clear: consumers are accumulating credit card debt to repay home loans.
At the same time, card issuers primarily monitor financial flows and not asset values, so a fall in house prices does not necessarily cause a change in the creditworthiness of borrowers.
Creditors may also benefit from the situation.
If the property is worth less than the value of the mortgage loan, the incentive for consumers to pay off the loan is reduced; as a result, the repayment of debts on credit cards is promoted in the priority ranking.
By changing interest rates or lending limits, card issuers can adapt to changing conditions more quickly and flexibly than mortgage lenders.
Theoretically, this should reduce the risk of sudden repricing of assets.
“It’s unlikely that we’ll wake up one day to completely revalue our loans,” said Gary Perlin, chief financial officer at Capital One.
If a subprime-like sudden crisis in the credit card market is less likely, the risk of a gradual decline is much higher.
If falling housing prices and declining lending plunge the U.S. economy into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a bleak future.
It's worth watching those predatory fins.
British Bankers Plead Guilty in Enron Case
On Wednesday, the three British bankers who were brought to trial for their role in a fraud involving Andrew Faston, the former chief financial officer of Enron, pleaded guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially pleaded not guilty to seven counts of fraud, alleging that they were cooperating with Fastow in a 2000 covert fraud attempt to make themselves rich at the expense of their employer.
Their trial began in January.
But at a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., they all pleaded guilty to single-member fraud.
The three former employees of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group’s Greenwich NatWest division became well-known in Britain during the two-year extradition process.
The investigation into Enron’s collapse in 2001 is still pending in the United States.
A first indictment in 2002 warned Fastow that he was one of the targets of a government investigation into Enron's bankruptcy.
The three stockbrokers, dubbed the "NatWest Three," were accused of traveling to Houston in 2000 in an effort to pre-empt fraud with Fastow and Michael Kopper, Fastow's right-hand man at the time.
Fastow, who is responsible for planning the countless frauds that bankrupt Enron, also controlled the Enron subsidiary in which Greenwich NatWest invested.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had no knowledge of any stake in the subsidiary, but the three British men were well aware that the stake was very large.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the bank’s $1 million stake in the subsidiary.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 to acquire a stake in the company.
Fastow has falsely informed Enron that the energy company will buy the $20 million stake in its subsidiary from Greenwich NatWest.
But in fact, the $20 million hit the nail on the head of the British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the prosecution, the bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of involvement in the collapse of Enron.
The British were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a Louisiana federal prison.
Kopper is serving a three-year, one-month sentence in a Texas prison.
The three British men were allowed to travel to the United States on bail for $1 million each, where they will be staying during the trial.
Enron, the seventh-largest U.S. corporation, filed for bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks failed to hide millions of dollars in debt or businesses that were reported to be profitable but were in fact unprofitable.
The collapse has caused thousands of jobs to be lost, more than $60 billion in market value, and more than $2 billion in pension funds.
Kenneth Lay, founder and former CEO of Enron, Jeffrey Skilling, was convicted last year of complicity in the company’s bankruptcy.
Skilling is currently serving more than 24 years in prison.
The conspiracy, fraud, and other charges against Lay were dropped after his death last year.
There is no poverty in Moscow.
Starting at $54 million, a Gulfstream G550 with a Rolls-Royce engine will make the Moscow-Los Angeles route without interruption, fueled by a tank.
However, for some Russian rich people, this amount is just small change.
"It's got room for 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But no one orders so many seats because the machines are bought for private families or company executives."
Mr. Firer was expecting visitors at the four-day, exclusive Millionaires Fair, held in a huge exhibition hall near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury goods suppliers rented booths at the exhibition, hoping that the Russian new rich would be interested in everything from mahogany-clad yachts to diamond-coated 50-cent radiator grilles.
Mr. Firer watched carefully the bright orange Porsche on the stand next to him.
"It's a nice car, but it's not even close to our products," he said.
“Russia has the largest market for private jets after the United States.”
The Russian capital seems to be swimming in money like Dallas did at the height of the oil boom.
"We went through a similar process in the 1890s, when some American millionaires went to Europe, and these Americans were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a senior fellow at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like gamblers in Saudi Arabia in the 1970’s and Japan in the 1990’s, the Russians are now the world’s most spectacular spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are demanding their share of the gold rush.
At another conference organized by the luxury industry in Moscow, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, shared their opinion on how to sell high-value products in markets similar to Russia.
(The conference was organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
According to Forbes’ list of the richest people in Russia, there are 53 billionaires with a total of 282 billion dollars.
In addition, the number of second-class Russian millionaires amounts to 103,000, totaling $670 billion, according to a study by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, which analyzes personal welfare development in the former Soviet Union.
(According to World Bank data, the number of people living below the subsistence level in Russia was 15.8% in 2005.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for David Morris Jewelry in London.
Nicole attended the fair for the first time with the Russian distributor of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
“All women are flawlessly groomed, and men are a veritable treasure trove.”
Two real estate agents, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, were accused of being millionaires.
“I looked at the cars and I’m trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche,” said Yumatova, a young man who was brazenly rushing around in his unique design suit, as if he’s already used to the hype.
The fair was organized primarily for the new rich, for those brand-oriented Russian buyers who are willing to walk around a drafty, ciphered location after spending several hours in traffic, where they can find Cadillac Escaleds, platinum pocket knives, M<0xC3><0xB6>venpick ice cream, standard billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund.
For the average person, the ticket costs 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians like to know which brands are the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at the stand of Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft, opposite a wall-sized, hand-decorated Rembrandt imitation painted on blue tiles.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in striking things."
Indeed, the sellers here have said that the long-term rich Russians (which, according to Russian standards, means 10-15 years) have already switched from flashy logos to bagatelle, limited-edition brands that would not make it to a trade fair.
Still, thousands of people, including millionaires, millionaires’ agents, and tourists, filled the place to the brim every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, director of the King Koil bed manufacturing company, said he sold two mattresses made of silk, cashmere and cotton, woven with gold thread, worth $70,000 each, that day.
Also on the evening of the first day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales associate of the A1 Moto, which supplies high-quality cars with a modern alarm, reported that his company sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for 170,000 dollars.
Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a luxury car manufacturer that provides custom solutions, sold three radiator grilles for Rolls-Royce Phantoms on Sunday afternoon. The grilles resemble connected chain bracelets and cost $55,000 each.
He also showed reporters a wheel made for a Russian casino owner, which he said was coated with Swarovski crystals to give the appearance of a roulette wheel.
The price of a set of four is $22,000.
"A Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich skins and a picture of his wife's face made of zirconium cubes will not necessarily use these objects," Karapetian said.
"Instead, he'll keep them in the garage of the 30 to 40-car garage."
Despite the fact that many of its Russian customers are wealthy, Karapetian says the term "Russian millionaire" is not a great privilege these days, given the rapid rise in real estate prices there.
“If you bought a property in Moscow four or five years ago, you’re probably a millionaire today, if not in money, at least on paper,” he said.
"They're more numerous than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least give the appearance of wealth in front of the stand of the Russian asset management company Alliance Continental.
The company built four English-style telephone booths that were stacked with millions of counterfeit dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 counterfeit notes for the Millionaires’ Fair.
Many of the visitors stopped to play with the money, and many took pictures with their mobile phones as they rolled around in the cash pile or just pocketed a few million dollars.
"You see, everyone in Moscow can feel like a millionaire," Karryev said.
Suspected surgical error after death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving that Ronald Livingston looked out of the glass window of a restaurant called “Just a Little Healthier” and saw an ambulance stop on Cape Cod two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Soon after, a police car arrived.
Then another one.
“Then I saw the doctor’s car stop,” said Mr. Livingston, one of the inspectors working in the restaurant on Wednesday.
“I knew then that someone had died.”
Authorities have learned that the dead woman, 41-year-old Olga Arroyo, had previously worked as a senior assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
An investigation is currently underway to determine whether the death was caused by an intervention by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon working at 212 West Scott Avenue, who was not identified by the police.
Authorities have not yet been able to determine the cause of Arroya’s death, but they hope the results of the toxicology tests, which will become available in a few weeks, will shed light on this mysterious death, which has caused great pain to senior members of the Newark Police Department.
Arroyo, whose voice was well-known in the department, has worked as an assistant to police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006.
“He was loyal, hardworking and reliable,” McCarthy said in a phone interview Wednesday.
". He was my guard dog.
He was my protector.”
McCarthy said Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former NYPD police officer who now works for the Liquor Control Commission, and left behind two boys, a 14-year-old and an 11-year-old, as well as a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators were investigating whether Ms. Arroyo had been the victim of an unlicensed surgeon.
"There's a probability," Walsh said.
"The investigation is ongoing."
Authorities report that they arrived at the house around 3 p.m. in November.
The 21st and Mrs. Arroyo were found on the couch.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week has passed, and the police have so far given very little information about the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't say if Castro had been interviewed by investigators.
Participants in the study were asked whether a part of the house functioned as a doctor’s office.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Castro’s home, where a withered rose bush stood in the narrow front garden and a Dalmatian barked from the back of the house.
Next to the door leading to the cellar, in the driveway, there was a blue tank with the inscription "Etil Vanilin", which is used as a substitute for vanilla in dishes and perfumes.
Hooks with two mountain bikes hanging sideways.
McCarthy recalled when she first arrived in Newark after 25 years with the New York City Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was invaluable in helping her navigate the unusual and unpolished political culture of the new city.
“He always said, ‘With this and with that, you’d better be careful!’”
“He was always here when I arrived in the morning, and he was always there when I left in the evening.
It was embarrassing.”
Fed Interest Rate Cut Expectations Lead to Global Stock Market Crash
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic surged yesterday after reassuring statements by the U.S. Central Bank’s deputy governor raised hopes that the Fed would seek to ease investment opportunities by further cutting interest rates.
Stock markets in both London and New York and across Europe have been rocked after Donald Kohn, who is the right-hand man for Fed chairman Ben Bernanke, said leaders should respond “flexibly and pragmatically” to the ongoing unrest in financial markets.
In addition to Kohn’s clear aim of calming markets amid signs of a resurgent credit crisis, he said the current unrest “has partially set back the market’s progress in late September and October.”
He said that if the increased confusion persists, it could increase the possibility of further restrictions on the credit conditions of households and companies.
Investors interpreted the statements as the Fed’s readiness to inject fresh capital into U.S. markets or even further interest rate cuts to stabilize credit conditions.
The statements have also had a calming effect on Wall Street, which has recently been hit by several bad news affecting the US economy, including a negative record for the number of home sales in the US.
The side effect of the financial unrest was reinforced by the announcement by investment bank Bear Stearns that it would lay off 650 employees and 4% of its global workforce to offset losses in the U.S. second-market housing loan sector as part of a cost reduction.
A total of 20 jobs at the London headquarters, which has 1,500 employees, are affected by this measure.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average index increased by 331 points, 2.55 percent, and closed at 13.289.40 points, while the broader S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
The London-based FTSE 100 index grew by 165.5 points, 2.7 percent, and closed at 6,306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 to the value of British blue-chip companies.
The German Dax grew by 2.6%, while the French CAC40 grew by 2.3%.
The turmoil in the credit market was renewed after a high-demand auction organised by the European Central Bank (ECB) brought three-month maturity securities to European banks at a price of 4.7%, which has not been seen since April 2001.
After the UK’s interbank interest rate, Libor, hit its highest level since November 12, at 6.59%, the Bank of England was under increasing pressure to follow the Fed and the ECB and to inject additional capital into the London financial market.
Britain calls for decision between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
There are two dilemmas, one more complicated than the other.
Who should wear the England team's number six jersey in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And in the indirect context of the first test against Sri Lanka, who makes the decision is no less important?
The latter question is topical, partly because David Graveney, the head of selections, who temporarily fulfills this particular task, will help head coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan to make a decision. On the other hand, because the desk drawer of the English managing director Hugh Morris is beginning to fill with requests for access to the national, or at least one-off, selection post.
The shortest of the two players is the one who doesn’t get the sixth place, but as we know, life, and especially sports, are often unfair.
It is never easy to say what makes a person reach the top of his or her profession, when no one else can get through even at a lower level.
It is not only in cricket that it is difficult to choose, often on a subjective basis.
Is it time for Bopara to move forward?
Is it fair to Shah if this happens?
The same question could arise in other areas of life, for example, if John Edwards and "Tubby" Banerjee, two smart, well-educated young leaders well-versed in business, were put before decision-makers, while there was room for only one of the two.
Who can tell which level a cricketer belongs to without being thrown into deep water in a more serious competition?
Of course, data greatly influences decision-making, but opportunities are just as important.
In a team, the player must catch the captain's eye at the right moment at the cricket gate, and a batsman must regularly get a chance to become a great player once he wants to.
Catching the whimsical look is much more complicated.
James Anderson, for example, played better than James Anderson last season, but he is a solid member of the team in the first test, even though Stephen Harmison says he is in good shape and is doing very well.
Anderson scored 32 first-class goals and 33 runs to fight for his place on the tour.
Chris Tremlett only hit 29, but both of them have had successful moments at the highest level and hope to have them in the future.
Whether Shah or Bopara will play at the Asgiriya Stadium will be decided by their opinion.
This decision can either uplift or break anyone’s career, but it may not have any particular impact on the future.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played every test and did well with five goals and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, who rose to prominence and became a dominant test cricketer, who is perhaps still underappreciated even today, despite the fact that he scored double hundred against the Australians in Australia.
It is likely that during their meeting at the Asgiriya Stanion during today’s game, Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will vote for Shah’s greater experience against Bopara’s youthful vigor and dynamism.
There are arguments in favour of both.
Shah’s brilliant and successful debut in the Bombay testing quarters of 1988 is a good one for him. In contrast to his seven-year-old Bopara six, who is 22 years younger than him, who also scored 32 first-class hundred in excellent twisted throws.
However, the fact that the Middlesex player Shah only ran 10 games in two quarters at home against the West Indies at Lorda in May, and the fact that Vaughan's re-emergence in the next game was met with immediate opposition from the selectors, seems to have reduced his tenacity, which was still evident in Bombay.
As opposed to him, Essex’s universal talent is a lively and unsurpassed player.
Nothing can upset him on the cricket field, but his off-track behaviour was well characterized when he overturned a four-wheeled car from the team’s car sponsor, Volkswagen, at an exhibition.
However, the first thing he did after that was to pick up his (of course sponsored) Vodafone phone and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who was watching him from a distance, to ask him, "Did you see this?"
Bopara is a better player on the side of the field with class. With his sloping medium moves, he develops an advantageous pitching angle, and his punches are confident and skillful.
Choosing the right person is one thing and choosing the right moment is another.
Perhaps this is the true art of selection.
Personally, I'd give Bopara the chance right now, which doesn't mean I don't think Shah would be outstanding if, as the tea leaves in Ceylon suggest, he was the one playing this weekend.
Refugees are being transported home by bus to work and fight Al Qaeda.
Since yesterday, the first buses have been arriving in Baghdad from Syria with Iraqi refugees who have run out of money or expired visas, or who hope that the city is back in order.
There are also those among them who have returned to fight the soldiers who have driven them out of their homes.
The Mansour bus station was already full of refugees returning from Syria and Jordan before a government convoy of 800 people from Damascus loaded with dozens of buses arrived.
“I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad,” said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today because I saw on TV and in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and that the city is now safe.
“They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people,” he added, referring to the militia minister Moqtada al-Sadr, who is currently shutting down his Shia army.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from predominantly Sunni-populated Amariya, returned home with his two children because he failed to renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevented Iraqis from taking jobs.
Amariya’s Shia neighbors called him and urged him to return home, saying that with the help of U.S.-backed troops, Al Qaeda had been pushed out of their bastion in the western part of the capital.
One of the first to arrive from Jordan was a Sunni and Shia tribal leader who fled a grenade attack from his home in Sleikh, north of Baghdad, after he began urging his fellow citizens to fight al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
“Two days ago, my friends called and told me that they had formed an anti-Al Qaeda militia in Sleikh and they needed the support of me and my sons.
That’s why I came back today,” Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62, said.
Many spoke of the strengthening of peace in the capital since the American troops entered, and of being lured back home by armed civilian forces cooperating with the Americans.
However, more people were forced to return home from Damascus because of visa and financial problems.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, who has three children, has voiced a widespread view among refugees that Shia Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has asked the Syrian government to reject a visa application to force refugees to return home.
It is believed that more than two and a half million people have escaped from the death squads operating in the country.
“Everything was fine until al-Maliki paid a visit to Syria and pressured the government not to issue more visas to Iraqis to return home,” he said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I ran away.”
One of the reasons for the easing of violence was the expulsion of Sunnis from the Shia areas, while the Shia also left the Sunni-populated areas.
Many fear that the sudden appearance of refugees will once again upset the mood, which may even lead to further fighting.
Small Saarland - high-quality training
The smallest federal state is a leader in professional training, and its higher education is also internationally oriented.
Only in one area of training do the Saar people struggle with the same shortcomings as the rest of the country.
"Yesterday, I explained to a person outside the Saarland that we are not French for the 50th time," the self-ironic slogan of the 50th anniversary of the smallest federal state is proclaimed on its posters.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the education system in the Saar, which is ranked fifth according to surveys by the German Institute of Economics (IW) in Cologne.
In this way, higher education institutions cooperate closely with neighbouring countries, even if only for the sake of tradition.
The University of Saarbr<0xC3><0xBC>cken was founded by the French in 1948.
To this day, students can complete their studies with a double or even triple degree.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is high at 15.6%.
However, Saarland’s colleges and universities also have an above-average appeal to those who want to study in the Saar region – many of them without a high school diploma.
“The Saar region is taking advantage of the opportunities for vocational training,” explains Axel Pl<0xC3><0xBC>nnecke, an education expert at the German Institute of Economics.
More than one-fifth of young people are admitted to vocational schools, which is more than seven percent above the federal average.
The combination of professional and higher education is well established.
The dual study infrastructure is the second largest in Germany in terms of population.
However, despite practice-oriented training and growing interest, the number of graduate engineers has decreased by a third in recent years.
The Saarland Ministry of Education has therefore committed higher education institutions to a marketing campaign focused on engineering.
"We have initiated a number of reforms in primary schools following the first Pisa study," a spokesman for the Ministry of Education said.
Therefore, the government has introduced comparative tests across the country.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last year of kindergarten is free of charge. This is a model that, in the meantime, the other federal states have also begun to copy.
Only future comparative studies will provide the answer to the question of whether pupils’ performance is improving in a lasting way.
The 2003 Pisa survey found that the proportion of students at risk dropped from 29 percent to 20 percent.
However, overall the performance of the Saar has not improved as much as that of the other Länder.
Bavarians count better.
To the greatest annoyance of the Saar people, knowledge of foreign languages is not taken into account in the measurement of Pisa - otherwise they would otherwise be able to reap the rewards in this area,
After all, the language of the neighbouring countries is a compulsory subject in grammar schools – even if the Saar people are not French.
Chavez sets the clocks
In the near future, the clocks in Venezuela will be different from those in the rest of the world.
On December 9th, President Hugo Chavez will turn back the qualifying time in the Latin American country by half an hour.
In the meantime, Chavez has become a laughing stock in Spain.
According to Venezuela’s official newspaper, the clocks will be turned back four and a half hours to Greenwich Mean Time.
In this way, the South American state will be part of a time zone that is not in use in any other country in the world.
The anti-U.S. Chávez justified his decision, among other things, by forcing the entire time zones based on hours into the world.
Chávez also announced on Wednesday that he would cut ties with neighboring Colombia over a hostage situation.
The left-wing nationalist politician said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he will not keep in touch with the president or the Colombian government.
“I cannot do this for my own dignity,” Chavez said, calling for a constitutional reform on which the people of the oil country must express their opinion in a referendum on Sunday.
The reform would significantly build up its power in the country.
The dispute was sparked by Uribe’s decision to revoke Chavez’s mandate to negotiate the release of hostages with Colombian Marxist rebels.
Uribe’s decision “facially spat” on Venezuela, echoing Chávez’s criticism on Sunday.
Everyone in Spain is talking about Chavez.
A new cell phone ringing in the country attracted attention: “Por qué no te callas” (Why don’t you shut your mouth) – this is the phrase that more than half a million people have downloaded from the Internet.
The sentence comes from János Károly, King of Spain, who was so upset by the constant interjections of the populist politician of Balolda at the last Latin American summit that he cut into its words in this way.
German workers at risk of wage cuts in 2007
According to a forecast, German workers are at risk of a real wage decline this year, despite the strong economic climate.
There are a number of reasons why experts support their pessimistic forecasts.
According to calculations by the Hans-Br<0xC3><0xB6>ckler-Foundation, employees in 2007 may actually expect to receive less pay than in the previous year.
"The reason for this is modest wage growth, an increase in value added tax and a rapid rise in food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research told the newspaper Bild.
There may also be additional burdens on workers in relation to unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck said in a statement to the daily Neue Osnabr<0xC3><0xBC>cker Zeitung that the current situation is correct and reasonable to reduce unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the beginning of the new year.
In any case, the German Federal Labor Agency should not be in such a difficult position to apply to the federation for credit or support, the politician of the German Social Democratic Party, SPD, was quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it became known that the price explosion of food and mineral oil products resulted in the highest inflation in 13 years.
In annual comparison, prices increased by a total of 3 percent.
Venus is Earth's evil twin.
Despite the harsh atmosphere of Venus, it is more similar to Earth than previously thought: In its atmosphere, the European Venus Express spacecraft has discovered lightning strikes, and in its polar orbits, wind vortices similar to those that occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have assumed that Venus is lightning.
The European “Venus Express” spacecraft has provided evidence – it has detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: Lightning on Venus spreads from cloud to cloud at an altitude of about 56 kilometers, reports Christopher Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles, on the pages of the science magazine “Nature”.
According to the famous "primitive soup theory", the formation of life on Earth was caused by lightning: According to the theory, thunderstorms triggered reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there ever was life there, it must have been in very early times," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
At present, there can hardly be a living organism on the surface of Venus: The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, and temperatures sometimes reach 500 degrees.
"Venus may be Earth's hellish twin, but it's still Earth's twin," Russell said.
The main question of the Esa mission is why Venus, so similar in mass and size to Earth, is on a completely different path of evolution.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone in the exploration of Venus, because no probe has been on its way to find this planet since the early 1990s.
The latest findings, already presented in several "Nature" papers, are not only proving the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system, according to the researchers.
"They also point out that the resemblance of the neighboring planet to Earth is greater than we first assumed," Esa said.
In addition to the well-known North Pole cyclone, the researchers also discovered a much faster moving cloud vortex at the South Pole.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the Earth’s winter hemisphere, according to a team led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica in Italy.
The second innermost planet in the solar system is almost the same mass as Earth, and with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, it is almost the size of Earth.
The star, also known as the Morning Star, orbits the Sun in less than 225 days.
However, it rotates much more slowly around its own axis: a Venusian day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus’ surface temperature, combined with a pressure of 92 bar, barely resembles Earth’s, scientists assume that both planets formed under completely similar conditions.
Both of them accumulated water, which remained on Earth as an ocean, while on Venus it left for the universe.
And while on Earth carbon dioxide is bound in carbonate rocks, on Venus it forms a large part of the atmosphere.
K<0xC3><0xB6>hler defends Merkel's meeting with Dalai Lama
German President K<0xC3><0xB6>hler has called for an end to the bipartisan debate surrounding the reception of the Dalai Lama in the office of chancellor.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for attacking the chancellor after a reception in September.
German President Horst K<0xC3><0xB6>hler is concerned about Germany’s prestige and has called on the Grand Coalition to end the controversy surrounding the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“We should not be seen as a divided nation on this issue,” K<0xC3><0xB6>hler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, K<0xC3><0xB6>hler expressed his understanding that Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) received the Dalai Lama in September.
“Human rights for me are universally valid, even if I respect the differences between cultures,” he said.
Everyone is aware that Germany must take care of the delicate balance of foreign policy, the President of the Republic stressed; however, Merkel defended the accusation that the Chancellor would pursue a new China policy.
“The Federal Chancellor has not broken with the traditional ‘one China’ policy.
China is aware of this," K<0xC3><0xB6>hler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly voiced his displeasure with the reception of the Dalai Lama and thus became the target of attacks in the ranks of the Union.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the EU’s “opening policy” in the field of foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama in the chancellery office, there were fierce disturbances in the German-Chinese relationship.
Not only did the Chinese government reject the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck (SPD), but, according to SPIEGEL, it also froze the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the two countries’ foreign ministries.
Chinese President Wen Jiabao has now called on German Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that receiving the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China will refuse to let European politicians receive the Tibetan religious leader in his official capacity, Wen Jiabao confirmed.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama have shown that he is trying to separate further Tibetan areas from China, including Tibet and other present-day provinces.
Schäuble warns of riots similar to those in France
Street clashes with police, shootings, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots similar to those in France.
Every effort must be made to prevent social unrest in Germany from escalating into street violence, the interior minister said.
Barricades blazed, rioters fired shot shotguns at police: Following severe riots among young people in France, Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) in Germany fears similar developments.
“We have to make sure that the social explosives don’t accumulate in us and don’t end up in violence.
We have to take this seriously,” he told the Neue Presse newspaper in Hannover.
Not all young people adapt to the rapid changes in social reality.
Alliances, provinces and communities are currently working intensively on problem cases, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
“From the integration summit to the Islam conference, the first successes are already visible.”
However, it is still too early to resolve the emergency.
Schäuble at the same time referred to the fact that there are no urban and sociological problems in the German suburbs as there are in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people fought heavy street battles with police in recent nights.
Cars and public buildings were also burning in Toulouse.
Taking all this into account, Kenan Kolat, the leader of the Turkish Communities in Germany, demanded more activity from the federal government in terms of integration.
In the wake of the riots in France, Kolat warned of the “danger of imitation”.
Although the situation in Germany is not as sensitive as it is in France,
Still, action is needed.
Kolat said the unemployment rate among young people under the age of 25 from immigrant families was "higher than the average."
Above all, more educational facilities should be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We need to provide a perspective for young people."
However, the head of the Turkish Community added that “family social supervision” is much more present in Germany than in France.
In addition, many young people from immigrant families do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat warns, "Nevertheless, we must be on our guard."
Young people must be given the opportunity to work and be educated as quickly as possible.
Meanwhile, in the suburbs of Paris, Villiers-le-Bel, during the night, there was complete calm.
Hundreds of policemen were standing by, a helicopter with headlights sweeping the area.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as some flaming trash cans and cars.
Since the reporting, a security unit of around 1,000 people has ensured peace of mind.
Police are ready to intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie said after a visit to the suburbs.
Over the course of the night, about 80 police officers were injured as a result of the riots in Villiers-le-bel.
The next night, the riots spread to Toulouse.
The riots were sparked by a traffic accident in which two young people died on Sunday.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
A Cloudwalker in Angela's Empire
The chancellor's realistically far-fetched action is proof that the coalition is coming to an end - and nothing is expected of him either.
What country does the Federal Chancellor live in?
After the Bundestag’s bleak general debate, its indifferent and meaningless action in terms of content, it must be said that it does not live in the country whose government it is supposed to govern.
Angela Merkel has rejected the accusation with a very pompous sentence, saying that she would focus too much on foreign policy.
This is provincial, he replied, and in this way only expressed that he did not want to understand what his critics were talking about.
At the Federal Assembly, he made it clear to everyone how appropriate the reproaches were.
At the same time, there was no concrete interest or empathy for the country’s problems.
Instead, Angela Cloudwalker emerged: a politician who is detached from reality, who is on the run from foreign policy, and there is only uncertainty.
An example of climate protection: He praises himself unrestrainedly for the Heiligendamm Resolutions, but is silent on how to achieve the climate goals in the country.
At all, as far as self-glory is concerned, two years earlier, the President of the CDU would not have allowed such modesty.
He now clings to the phrase that prosperity has a positive effect on people.
This harms his reputation as a pragmatic person who offers solutions to problems instead of flowers of words.
However, in Angela’s cloud-hosted empire, domestic political problems are only incidental.
Child poverty and low-income problems?
This is only appreciated by a few half-sentences.
In this respect, it is telling how often you err on the side of the tongue when it comes to family allowances.
Merkel will have to push three times to put together a half-right sentence.
When it comes to specifics, he stumbles on foreign territory.
Roham Division
During the debate between Republican presidential candidates on YouTube, the two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, were hit hard – and now they have to worry about an outside candidate.
Tensions between the candidates have already surfaced on the first issue.
Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani of making New York a “safe haven for illegal immigrants.”
“I would say that his own house was a refuge for illegal immigrants,” Giuliani replies, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of employing undocumented immigrants as private individuals.
As the Republican camp continues to lack a unanimously supported favorite, the eight presidential nominees use the debate on CNN above all else to undermine their opponent’s credibility.
The self-shooting 30-second videos submitted by internet users via YouTube are little more than short summaries.
“This is the kind of isolationism that brought Hitler to power,” said John McCain, who is the only one in the circle to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney’s head is also thoroughly washed by a Vietnam veteran who is reluctant to condemn so-called “Waterboarding” as torture, a method of interrogation that simulates drowning.
The fact that the important topics of the campaign are, in the meantime, outside of Iraq and the debates on torture is shown by the reactions of the public in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Loud applause breaks out in the room in praise of conservative values and rejection of future tax increases.
Meanwhile, the weaknesses of the two candidates are becoming more and more apparent.
“I was wrong at the time,” Romney said, apologizing to supporters and television viewers for choosing abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, is shaken when asked for his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf governs for the first time as a civilian
A day after his withdrawal from the army, he was sworn in as President Musharraf, who was in power in Pakistan.
This marks the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf was sworn into office for a further five years on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live from the capital, the Presidential Palace in Islamabad.
Musharraf has sworn an oath to act for the good of his people.
On Wednesday, he handed over his position as military leader to his confidant, Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus succumbed to international pressure, above all from the United States.
Eight years after taking power without bloodshed in the form of a military coup, the former general now governs for the first time as a civilian head of state.
Musharraf’s resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces met a fundamental demand from the West and the opposition.
A further important demand is the lifting of the state of emergency declared by Musharraf on 3 November.
Prosecutor-general Malik Muhammad Qayyum said Musharraf would end the state of emergency soon after he was sworn in to meet a further demand from the West.
The country's Supreme Court, in which Musharraf has placed lawyers sympathetic to him since the declaration of a state of emergency in early November, has rejected all protests over the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, an attack on a military convoy in northern Waziristan, a tribal area in the north, killed five soldiers and injured four others.
An army spokesman said the bomb had been detonated on a road near the Afghan border.
The Krautrock Fathers are Back
The German supergroup of the seventies is playing again: Three members of Harmonia dusted off their instrument again for a concert in Berlin.
During the reunion, a cut of their heyday, Live 1974, is released.
They were well known abroad at the time.
The announced sensation manifests itself in the person of the three agreed-upon gentlemen around the dinner table.
In front of each one is his own instrument, his own cable and, above all, his own buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, sits in a snow-white shirt in the middle.
Michael Rother, 57 years old from the left, is accompanied by a laptop and a guitar.
From the audience’s point of view, 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius leans and concentrates on the console.
Each of them produces some kind of noise, and occasionally a rhythm.
Sometimes it just happens to be traditional music.
But all this does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
It was a great excitement for fans of krautrock music that the Harmonia band was making music again.
What we can tell you here: As a result of proper research, we can conclude that the name has flown through the collective pop memory, but in no way has it left us with such lasting traces that we miss this band painfully after 32 years.
Why can't the Germans celebrate the legends of their seventies?
Especially that what we misleadingly call krautrock has always been valued more highly in England and America than in our own country.
When the music industry awarded the remaining members of the Cologne band Can the Echo Award for their oeuvre in 2003, the German pop figures sat in the hall with their unintelligible faces.
When he thanked both La D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf and Neu! in the laudation of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, the amazement became limitless.
At concerts, Michael Rother sat on stage as an old friend with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Domestic rejection and foreign acceptance are two sides of the same coin.
Memory is overburdened by Harmonia because the trio only existed for two years, during which time it exerted far less influence than others have attributed to it.
Moebius and Roedelius have already performed with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
Initially, they played in the basement under the Schaub<0xC3><0xBC>hne Theater in Berlin.
Then in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf, for economic reasons, to a church-funded record company.
Rother helped Kraftwerk for a short time, and at the same time became famous as a guitarist for Neu!, perhaps the most radical German band at the time.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the musicians of Cluster into exile at Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in Alter Weserhof, they lived in 16th-century Rom as an escaped communard.
Less ideologically than in the First Commune, where Roedelius was still struggling as a babysitter.
Their lives are more like idyllic artistry.
It is said that the flag of the Harmonia Ottenstein singing troupe was found from the rubbish and thus they found a name for their art.
Some of these things were recorded by Harmonia.
The first album is called "Musik von Harmonia" and the next is "De Luxe".
Despite his loose and modest music, the band was in financial need.
Collecting the woodpeckers alone did not ensure finding oneself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record-breaking audience of just under 50 people, so one remembers.
It was Rother's idea to force Harmonia and occasionally practice it at the time.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this is an immoral demand.
The band announced their break-up in 1975.
Rother ended up in esotericism and supported himself from albums such as Flammende Herzen.
The Cluster was revived in the 1980s, and has since been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
The live album Griessem was created by Herbert Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nemeyer.
His Greenland record company has set itself the goal of taking care of krautrock as a specific German addition to live music.
Within this framework, Neu! was excavated in the same way as Roedelius’ solo work.
The resurrection of Harmony will take place in the House of Cultures in Berlin.
Public money, within the framework of the Woldtronics Festival.
Also present is Julian Cope, author of the handbook "Krautrock Sampler".
The founder of Loveparade, Dr. Motte, is also present.
All this roughly outlines the influence of krautrock on the subsequent pop music era.
In this regard, Harmonia fills the empty space reserved for the super team.
Brian Eno once said, “The only true music is his future.”
There are pictures of the producer with Harmonia in the room of a farmhouse.
Additional black-and-white photos of tangled wiring equipment are projected for legend building.
In the foreground, the three veterans are once again engaged in improvisation.
This simply means that microphones are attached to the organ and the drum kit with the intention of tricking the instruments out of sound effects never heard before with the help of instruments that produce sound effects themselves.
Today, electric music looks like electric music.
Three tech-savvy tinkers.
All of this, even the house choir, does not change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, they cough and sneeze, and sing "Aaaaaaaah!" with a feeling in a beautiful part.
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
The roots were less sought in the blues than in the colleges of music (Can), in technical knowledge (Kraftwerk), or in flight from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
If anyone here shouts "'68!", he is not entirely on the wrong road, and Harmonia will not allow itself to be disturbed by this even now.
Even the most self-explanatory thing is thought through carefully on stage.
Where does the music begin and where does it end?
This can either make you nervous or give you a fleeting moment of exceptional luck.
Richard Gere is not a cynic.
Through "Hunting" and "M<0xC3><0xB6>rderischer Frieden" again two films deal with the Balkan war.
But none of them are convincing.
The basic idea is either too focused on action and shooting, or too sentimental.
Even Richard Gere can't help you with that in "Hunting."
First, the good news: Although the two war criminals, Karadzic and Mladic, are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, they found the actor Richard Gere there, in the dark background of the Bosnian war.
Lately, we’ve lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because of his many good-for-nothing roles in emotional films for women and the many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism.
And suddenly, Richard Gere is the most compelling reason to watch "Hunting" after all.
In essence, the war correspondent Simon Hunt is exactly what Gere would have been if fate and the film industry had not been so kind to him: A man who had long since left his best years behind him, but whose decline has preserved much of its former charm as a ruinous monument.
However, the film "Hunting" and the German production "M<0xC3><0xB6>rderischer Frieden" that also started this week continues the endless series of failed films about the Balkan war.
The film "M<0xC3><0xB6>rderischer Frieden" does not have to waste much words: The film is about two German soldiers (Adrian Topol, Max Riemel) serving in Kosovo, who rescue a Serbian woman from the Kosovar snipers, and one of them suddenly falls in love with her.
While it is to be welcomed that, for once, Serbs are not portrayed as the sole cause of all evil, the film, which carries the shallowness of TV films, is too quickly lost in shootings and eventful scenes.
"Cobra 11" carries the character of a war instead of a highway.
On the other hand, in the case of "Hunting", it can be examined as an example why not a single really good film has been made about the Balkan war.
The story of three U.S. war correspondents who set out to find the Serbian war criminal known as "The Fox" with a different director, a different screenwriter (both in Richard Shepard's personal union) might have turned into a new "Apocalypse Now" at another time.
The stories have a surprising resemblance: In both cases, small groups set off into the forest to accomplish what the military can’t—and in both cases, it’s a maddening journey.
One of the reasons for the fall of “Hunting” is that he simply won’t let Simon Hunt be the depraved cynic he first introduces him to.
No, and in the script, he even spends a romantic relationship with a Muslim Bosnian woman who was later murdered.
“Hunting” slips away when reporters in the last five minutes of the film achieve what NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters around the world have failed to do in five years: capture the war criminal and then hand him over to the Muslim Bosnians for just revenge.
This is so bad that one would prefer to go to the International Criminal Court in The Hague for a crime against the logic of cinema.
The purpose of the film is deeply human.
He intends to discredit the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and accuses the Americans and the French (who are supposedly still exceptionally united) of not pursuing the persecution intensively enough because of secret political bargaining.
But sometimes good and evil are so similar that you think of a famous Brecht poem.
In it, the poet writes of a wooden mask depicting an Asian demon on his desk: "I gaze intently at the bulging vein in his temple, which betrays how tiring it is to be bad."
Films like "Hunting" have the same oversized, human-headed masks that show how tiring it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the genre of films about the war in the Balkans.
Recently, it was reported in the newspaper that all the Hollywood films about Iraq were a failure.
We can add: There is not a single good film about South Africa yet.
It’s almost always true: when a star roams the world’s hotspots or minefields, it turns out to be something like “On the Paths of Freedom” with Patricia Arquette, “Without Borders” with Angelina Jolie, or “Blood Diamond” with Leonardo Di Caprio.
It is possible that these conflicts are simply too close in time.
After all, it was decades before Hollywood was able to make a good film about the Holocaust with the film "Schindler's List."
There are probably a few films left to make, as the classic films about the Vietnam War, such as "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" were not universally celebrated as masterpieces in their day.
But it’s possible that today, when all the mass killings arrive in our homes in real time, right through two screens, we simply know too much about the world’s conflicts.
And it robs screenwriters of the reality of ignoring what it would take to tell good stories.
After all, “To Be or Not to Be” or “The Dictator” was so successful because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how terrible the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn't pursue the good if you want to make a good movie.
Perhaps we need to take a sarcastically distant artistic view of novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When questioned about the parallels between his historical novel The Lexicon of Lempri<0xC3><0xA8>re and the Balkan War, he replied: "It depends only that certain things never change.
Big cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be horribly murdered, and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust has been criticised for resigning from the Olympics.
The mayor’s decision to withdraw from Hamburg’s bid to host the Summer Olympic Games has drawn heavy criticism from political and economic circles.
Many want to continue to fight for the organization of water games.
Von Beust, however, strongly warns against the realities when looking for an opportunity.
Hans-J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Schmidt-Trenz, chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, described the withdrawal as "unfavourable to the economic environment" on Wednesday.
No other project has recently unleashed such powerful motivational forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
“Without this goal, we would not be able to keep the momentum of sports policy at an even level.”
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to develop a long-term initiative “based on modified time coordinates.”
Mayor Ole von Beust has insisted that Hamburg’s ambitions for the Olympic Games are not realistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on the Olympic bid, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation in early December on the bid for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in Munich.
“For us, giving priority to this means that we will not have a realistic chance in the period up to 2028 that we have thought of so far.”
“We don’t give up on the dream,” Von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) expressed regret at von Beust’s statements.
This gives the impression that Hamburg does not intend to compete in the Olympic Games for the next 25 years.
“It’s too early to miss an opportunity by burying our plans right now,” HSB president G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Ploss said on Wednesday.
Moreover, the withdrawal from the application is contrary to the statement made by the President of the Senate at a reception held at the General Assembly of the German College of Sport.
There, von Beust’s bid for the 2015 Universiade of Hamburg was described as not being a substitute for the Hamburg Olympic Games.
The College Sports Association launched Hamburg as a city participating in the competition only last week.
The SPD civil faction complained to the Senate that it had left valuable time unspent in the construction of housing in Hamburg.
"The development of Kleiner Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it voted in favour of the Olympics and did not build houses," said SPD representatives Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD continuously spearheaded the integrated plan of the Olympic and later housing utilization in relation to Kleiner Grasbrook, the CDU unilaterally focused on the "event factor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games was a huge success in Hamburg at the time.
However, Hamburg fell in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's crates.
Anyone who associates the concepts of Sweden and the wooden box with each other is thinking of Ikea, not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, wooden chests made in Sweden cast a dark shadow on the list of Warhol's works.
Most of the ninety-four "Stockholm-type" Brillo Boxes listed here are forgeries.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" doubted the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo Boxes a few months ago, now the internal investigation of Moderna Museet in Stockholm has come to a sobering conclusion: The six "Brillo Box" copies donated to Moderna Museet by Pontus Hultén, a former museum director, in 1995 - and most likely one hundred more "Brillo Boxes" on the international art market
The prehistory is a long and complicated, confusing chain of artistic and curatorial feats.
Warhol created his first "Brillo Boxes" in New York in 1964 - painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard box of "Brillo" soap powder.
At an exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968, with the approval of Warhol, hundreds of cardboard Brillo boxes were exhibited: These (for cost-saving reasons) did not come from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
It was not about works of art, but about their templates and simple pieces of exhibition.
At the same time, in 1968, Warhol gave permission to produce some of the Brillo wooden crates in Sweden, which, however, were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
The witnesses of the time now speak of about fifteen chests which, at that time certified as the Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box, were rightly included in the history of art and auction under the designation "Stockholm type".
Some were auctioned for more than $100,000.
The problem, however, is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that about a hundred wooden crates were manufactured and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol left to him.
In fact, Hultén’s 105 chests were only manufactured in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time, however, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Bystr<0xC3><0xB6>m, the main monumental caretaker of Moderna Museet, examined six Brillo Boxes, owned by the museum, as well as three Swedish privately owned boxes, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: The pressed chipboards were first flattened and polished, then the white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, shows that the paint was applied directly to the chipboard with a paint roller, without a foundation - and this is not an oil paint, but an acrylic paint.
“These crates are not certified by the artist and should therefore be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo Boxes,” says Lars Nittve, director of Moderna Museet: “Unless the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York decides otherwise, Moderna Museet will classify the six crates in its collection as copies/exhibition material.”
The Authentication Board announced in June that it was investigating "serious allegations" of soap dust crates.
Since then, however, they have been indulging in inexorable silence.
Rebel forces in Manila surrender
Soldiers in the Philippines who barricaded themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He cannot be held responsible for the carnage, said Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud.
Prior to this, the hotel was stormed by government soldiers using tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had barricaded themselves in the building for hours.
Half of the team were on trial on Thursday for the 2003 failed coup attempt, including Trillanes.
He used the trial to get rid of 30 sympathizers all of a sudden.
The military police charged with guarding the man apparently switched to him and joined the mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government units have sealed off the area around the prestigious hotel.
The president has called an emergency meeting of the security cabinet.
Security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiers' actions.
"People have had enough," said Trillanes.
"We invite people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who had previously commanded the Scout Rangers, stated that other units of the army wanted to join the march in a short time.
Critics of the government on Friday called for a strong protest against the president.
The government has been facing corruption allegations for several months.
As early as 2003, the financial district of Manila was the main scene of an attempted mutiny against Arroyo by about 200 members of the military.
The uprising failed after less than 24 hours when the army refused to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempted coups in the Philippines against democratically elected governments.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder in Versatel
United Internet has acquired more than 20 percent of Versatel.
As the company announced on Wednesday evening, the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
This represents a 20.05 percent stake in the share capital.
There have been speculations about the takeover before.
The possibility of increasing the share acquired in Versatel remains open.
The move is aimed at consolidating the German DSL market, according to United Internet.
Earlier on Wednesday, assumptions were made about a possible merger, after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf network operator by a further 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The financial institution reserves the share only to a third party, it is reported on the financial market.
On the previous day, United Internet already owned just under 10 percent of the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch issued 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
United Internet bought 5.15 million shares for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies initiated a dialogue on cooperation on the launch of DSL and mobile phone products.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a spokesman for the United Internet said.
The two companies jointly established the MSP joint venture to take over the competing Freenet.
The two companies are initially content with a good 10 percent stake in Freenet and will not exercise their right to take over another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies are leaving all options open, in particular to increase their shareholding in Freenet AG.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on the strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
The poker game around Freenet, which has been going on for months now and which can only be seen with ease, is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million contracted mobile phone customers and 1.27 million DSL and fixed line access customers.
The holding company formed by United Internet and Drillisch has so far held a direct 6.01% stake in Freenet.
Now it has been agreed that Drillisch will bring in an additional round four percent.
The acquisition of 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas was agreed in August.
