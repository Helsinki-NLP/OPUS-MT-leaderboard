28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping mall this week.
The victim's brother says that he did not know anyone who wanted to harm his brother. "He had finally got his affairs in order."
The body found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco man Frank Galicia, according to the San Francisco Forensic Medical Office.
San Francisco police say the death is being investigated as a homicide.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC’s KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a chef in Boston, had found his dream job when he became the chef of the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said the death was a shock to all of them.
"We are a small and tight team, like a family, and we miss them very much," says the representative.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia says that Frank first lived in hostels, but that he had finally got his affairs in order.
"He found an apartment, and he had a girlfriend," Louis Galicia told KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn’t know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
"He was kind and big-hearted.
His way of being with the family was to cook for all of us,” says Louis Galicia.
"He never wanted to get into a fight with anyone.
He was a man who walked with the flow.
Despite all the injustices happening in the world, he was an uncut diamond that shone every day,” she says.
Anyone with knowledge of the incident is requested to call the San Francisco Police Department at 415-575-4444.
Young doctors on strike call for new industrial action
Representatives of junior doctors in the UK (who in Finland are mainly responsible for specialised doctors) have appealed to their trade union to request permission for new industrial action in a dispute over a new employment contract.
The junior medical committee (JDC), which is part of the British Medical Association (BMA), is asking its entire government for support for further industrial action starting in early September.
According to the JDC, the ministers have not solved the problems concerning the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected a contract with the BMA in a vote in July.
58% of the members who voted rejected the agreement.
Ellen McCourt, chairman of the Junior Medical Committee, posted on Twitter on Thursday night a letter to JDC members in which she said the government had “stubbornly silenced” the issues that, according to McCourt, led to her rejection of the agreement.
The letter reads: "In light of this, the JDC government has voted to reject the entire new draft agreement and insists that all of our concerns be renegotiated.
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC government has today submitted a formal request to the BMA government to request permission for incrementally expanding industrial action beginning in early September.”
Junior doctors have been on strike six times this year, including the first complete layoffs in the history of Britain’s public health system.
Johann Malawana, the BMA’s junior medical director, resigned after voting against the negotiated terms of the contract that the BMA had recommended.
Malawana told BMA members at the pre-vote meetings that the agreement was good and should be approved, with 54 000 junior doctors and medical students taking part in the vote.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the agreement would come into effect and apply to British doctors.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of outsiders?
It was a gesture that put an end to the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands for reconciliation and to formally end an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counterpart in the golden hall of his palace in St. Petersburg, I got the clear impression that Ankara had a greater desire for reconciliation.
The two sides shook hands,
But Putin’s smile looked thin, and he didn’t radiate much warmth, even by his own reticent standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke about his “good friend” Mr Putin – five times, according to one report.
I myself did not keep count.
In addition, he promised that relations with Russia will return even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country reported that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I understood his enthusiasm quite the opposite.
But the constant coolness emanating from Putin showed that the Russian Head of State has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was furious.
Putin attacked Ankara and accused him of stabbing him in the back.
The insult was all the greater because it came from a supposed friend.
It will be difficult, if not impossible, to regain true trust.
The public opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media campaigned extensively and aggressively against Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were the allegations by top officials that Erdogan’s own family has profited from illegal oil trade in ISIL-controlled areas of Syria.
Erdogan has strongly denied the accusations.
The official message from Peter, however, was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting was arranged only to get the apology that Putin demanded from President Erdogan.
In this way, Russia could gain some kind of victory.
The benefits of declaring a truce are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost ousted from power last month in a failed coup.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly shaken him, too.
There is also an economic incentive to the settlement.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard, especially the charter flight ban, as several million Russian tourists normally travel to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has dropped by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly breathe a sigh of relief when air travel can finally be resumed.
They put their faith in a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state television has predicted that the price of fruit and vegetables will fall as Turkish agricultural products are allowed to be imported again.
"You touristed there, tomatoes back here," the article in the financial magazine Vedemosti said.
But the visit also had greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because it believes that the West has reacted tacitly to the attempted coup.
Not to forget the old grudge against Turkey’s snail-paced EU accession negotiations and Putin’s meddling in the affairs of a Putin who is eager to take advantage of cool relations and break Turkey’s ties with the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support for the elected authorities after the attempted coup.
This was self-evident to Moscow, which has its own preoccupation with the change of power.
Thus, at their summit meeting in a gaudy seaside palace, Russia and Turkey were able to convey what one analyst described as an "alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel abandoned and mistreated by the West joining forces.
Despite public reconciliation, the two continue to have major differences.
The most significant is Syria, where Moscow has created an image of itself as a peace-builder, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposing sides.
It is very telling that, after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents told the press that they had not addressed the issue at all.
The Turkish President deliberately refused to answer the question of the disagreements between the two countries, while Putin, in turn, stressed them.
There is no clear consensus among the countries on where they could seek consensus in Syria.
In view of the possibility of a complete catastrophe caused by the shooting down of a Russian fighter plane by NATO member Turkey, it is undoubtedly better that, after months of open hostility, the two Heads of State should at least be speaking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing from customers outside Scotland
According to the Governor of RBS, the bank's operations outside Scotland will be reduced so that in the future it will only offer business services, i.e. back office services.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
The bank was forced to backtrack when it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued.
During that time, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsors international sports for millions of pounds, including Six Nations rugby and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to let more national brands come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will continue to be used by Scottish customers, but will not be known as RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are changed to NatWest except for headquarters and stock exchange listing.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a customer and staff presentation in Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: “RBS is becoming an investment brand and the one that our staff are employed by because we are now becoming a bank of many more different brands.
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our aspirations are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in their own community, and our staff works with customers under these brands.”
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations rugby, and it has raised the profile of various brands in sports sponsorship.
“Now is the right time to move to a multi-brand bank, because it’s fundamentally about how we can make the bank better for our customers,” he said.
“It would have been very sarcastic three years ago if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and introduced brands.
But our work and focus on our customers’ needs instead of our own has changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.”
Frankie Dettori rode the Predilution to victory at Newmarket and scored his 3,000th win
Dettori sprays champagne after winning twice in a row at Newmarket, marking his 3,000th win.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th win in the British Championship at Newmarket on Friday.
He achieved this milestone by riding his horse to victory twice in the same evening on the track in his locality. Predilution is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in flat track racing.
He has previously been joined by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who previously won at Ghayyar, says, “This is special.
My feelings are high because my family's here too.
I am very happy that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I ended up 30 years ago.
It’s not a big event, not a Royal Ascot, but a normal Friday night and a crowd of 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and humbled.”
Dettori accepts cheers with Predilution after his win
Two jockeys have reached a milestone in steeplechase racing, and they are master jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won more than 4,300 times in his record career.
Lester Piggott, 9-time Derby winner, 4,493 wins
“Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the time, and it’s no surprise that he’s the one who reached this milestone that few have reached.
He is elegant and strong, but his tactical prowess is what sets him apart from the rest.
He is a fantastic representative of horse racing, and his enthusiasm and pruning has brought fans to the sport for years.”
“I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have won 6,000 races by now if he hadn’t been racing only on the weekends and only in the big races!
Frankly speaking, Frankie’s riding career in the UK has been a triumph for almost 30 years, which has been great to follow.
He’s a lively person, which is good for British racing, but most of all he’s an incredible jockey.”
Frankie Dettori aired his achievement in his signature way by leaping off his horse.
Frankie Dettori has been a prime example of British racing for two decades.
There have been ups and downs along the way.
He has won a number of major championships, including his famous Ascot victory in 1996 in the "Magnificent Seven", but he has also survived a plane crash and been banned from the competition due to drug abuse.
When the ban on competition ended three years ago, he initially had start-up difficulties, but he showed admirable strength of character, showed his skepticism and returned to his best.
And he’s not going to end his career for a while – Dettori has recently said he wants to continue racing until he’s at least 50.”
Putin sacks head of administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin abruptly fired his head of state, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s inner circle for many years.
Ivanov, 63, has now been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
According to a Kremlin statement, President Putin “decided to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration”, but the reasons for the dismissal were not disclosed.
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov’s deputy manager since 2012, was appointed to the position.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn in 1972, Vaino graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he headed the Presidential Protocol Department and the Cabinet Office, according to the Kremlin’s Russian-language website.
He thanked Putin for his appointment, saying: “I am grateful for your trust.
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your actions as Head of State, which means making draft laws and monitoring how the instructions you give are implemented."
Putin told Russian television on Friday that Ivanov himself had asked for his resignation and recommended the persecution as his successor.
Are the smiles real?
This move has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov has long been close to Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, has a KGB past.
As head of administration, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
In a televised meeting with President Putin, both said Ivanov was withdrawing at his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, few are convinced by the explanations, especially in the run-up to the parliamentary elections.
Are they the result of a power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been extremely suspicious of the official claim that the man, who has been lauded as a potential president, suddenly wants to lead Russia’s environmental policy.
Ivanov's words to Putin are displayed on the Kremlin website, where he says: 'It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to give me responsibility for this very complicated and, to some extent, even difficult task for four years.
I’ve been president for four years and eight months.”
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB.
When Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted the most.
At one time, it was thought that Ivanov might become President of Russia after Putin’s second term, as the Constitution would have prevented Putin’s election for a third term.
However, the task went to another member of Putin’s immediate circle, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister and returned to office just three and a half years later.
'Criminal Minds' 'FBI Investigators' star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producer
Gibson was involved in a violent fight on set in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios said in a joint statement.
Gibson, known as Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
“We had creative differences.
I regret that this has happened," he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson's character will be written out of the next series of FBI agents will be released later, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios said in a statement.
Gibson, 54, who previously starred in the comedy series Dharma & Greg, has been a part of the series since its first season in 2005.
“I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the past twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement.
“I was hoping to see the series through to the end, but that’s no longer possible.
I want to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our great production team and most importantly, the best fans the show could have ever hoped for.”
Season 12 begins in the United States on September 28.
The Mysterious Landing of Fish in the Banff Garden
Banff resident Kevin Bain has asked for help identifying fish that have appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects that these 75 fish are sandeels that have been sucked into the earth by a hurricane.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the seashore, published footage of the sight on Periscope, hoping to get a response to the appearance of these five-centimeter fish.
Queensferry overpass now connected to Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern deck and land bridge of the Queensferry overpass, which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of the four sections between the "lid-vessels", which are now almost complete around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It contains 10 000 tonnes of steel and 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 cable cars.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was one of the first to walk from the land to the bridge.
Brown says: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry overpass.
We are all witnessing a truly significant step forward in the construction of the bridge, which alone has been constructed using more than 30 000 concrete and steel.
Despite its massive size and weight, the construction of the bridge section between the land bridge and the bridge deck is a subtle operation that requires extremely precise installation tolerances.
Almost 79% of the entire bridge deck is now in place, and the rest of the deck is getting its concrete cover cast in Rosyth today, which means the deck is ready to be lifted into place.”
Michael Martin, project manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, says: “The completion of the first section of the bridge is always a significant urine column in any bridge project.
In this fantastic project, this section represents the pinnacle of the civil engineering industry.
After the last part of the road deck was installed and attached to the North Tower column, we had to close the remaining gap on the north side (i.e. on the ground side).
This was done by pulling the north side land bridge 700 mm southward.
This was a massive and at the same time demanding operation.
Massive because the bridge is 222 metres long and weighs about 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up at an angle of about 3%.
And high-precision, because the tolerances that the work team had to follow were extremely small – only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went well.”
Moelfre Bay Rescue Department reveals three men miraculously rescued
In Anglesey, three men were miraculously rescued from a fishing boat.
The Moelfre RNLI marine rescue station raised the alarm at 1:20 p.m. local time on Friday after its crew spotted an accident in Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety while their boat continued its reckless course without a pilot.
“We saw the boat circling right next to them and imagined the worst,” says Vince Jones, who drives Moelfre’s lifeboat.
"By the time we got to the water, the strong winds had fortunately carried the boat away from them."
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while a third, aged 60, was found exhausted with a buoy and no life jacket.
They were all taken on board a coastal lifeboat and taken to a rescue station.
Vince Jones says, “It’s a miracle that these three men who were immersed in the water are still alive and well.
The boat’s engine had an emergency extinguishing cord on it, but it had somehow been disconnected from the man who was driving the boat during the crash.
They were really lucky on their way.”
Pokémon Go Hunt for Health and Happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
Over the past decade, many have complained about why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, preferring to stay inside and stare at their screens.
Pokémon Go gets people off the couch and on the move.
Initially, screen time was limited to watching TV, then video games, and most recently smartphones.
So it’s great to see that technology and outdoor exercise are not mutually exclusive.
Pokémon Go is a game app that features characters from a video game that was created in the 1990s (which later became a series of cartoons, playing cards, and other related products).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this also ended a bit before the new game became available in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was delayed by a huge interest that overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, Pokémon Go surpassed Tinder and was almost as high as Twitter.
How does the game work?
In short, players go out to look for Pokémon on their smartphones, which are tracked by GPS. When a Pokémon is found, it can be "photographed" (using the screen of the phone) or "captured".
The fad has swept away a generation that played video games when they were younger and lifted their butts off the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps that the "average" person takes per day.
The Washington Post recently reported, on the Apple Watch smartwatch Cardiogram app, which found within two days of the launch of the game that the number of people moving 30 minutes a day suddenly rose from 45 percent to 53 percent. Cardiogram tracks 35,000 users.
The company doesn’t know which user is playing Pokémon Go, it only sees the raw data of the amount of exercise.
Many public health campaigns encouraging people to get off the couch and exercise for at least 30 minutes a day have fallen on deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertisers have looked unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Regular exercisers are less likely to develop cancer or depression.
Exercise helps in weight management, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a large number of other benefits.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it gets people out to do something they enjoy.
In this way, it achieves three basic health benefits – exercise, fresh air, and the sun and joy.
During the hunt, it is even possible to make new friends.
As usual, this phenomenon is frowned upon by spoilers of joy.
And yes, someone can walk through the door.
What's the big deal?
A breakthrough is made.
Because while smartphone apps like Fitbit may have tracked your activity in the past, they didn’t give you a reason to get going, like Pokémon Go does.
The novelty will disappear, and in time the use will decrease.
However, the success of the Pokémon will result in more games that combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, increasing the physical activity of the people who go hunting and improving their fitness and health.

Simone Biles wins gold in women’s multi-sport competition
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
Dynamic jumps.
Easy on the boom.
Jaws dropping on the floor.
Excellent in everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast won the multi-match championship on Thursday and grew the distinction between herself and the rest of the world in the spotlight of the Olympics.
His overall score of 62,198 was clearly better than that of silver-ranked "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States will perform at the bar in the women’s artistic gymnastics individual competition finals on Thursday at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth consecutive and fifth American woman to win the multi-match title, cementing her reputation as the best of her generation, or even the best of all time.
Biles burst into tears as his final score came to light and his long journey to this moment ended.
The achievement takes the sport to a whole new dimension and puts it in the same category as other superstars in the sport, such as Michael Phelps:
Having won 15 world titles, including 10 gold medals, Biles has earned such an ambitious and precise program that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the greatest artistic gymnast of all time".
In Brazil, there was still one last race left, between Biles and himself and the burden of over-expectations, rather than between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Spring, Texas, with less than a handful of gold medals would be a disappointment.
Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman from the United States hugged after winning gold and silver in the Women's Artistic Gymnastics Singles Final on Thursday at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a point on top of i for the farewell party of Martha Karoly, who is now retiring and coordinating the national team.
While Biles claimed that he never thought of anything in advance when he was at the top for a long time, this is not entirely true.
Part of his permanence program – which includes a series of volts known as his trump card – has been adapted to Latin music that might well be heard on the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
Having been adopted by his grandparents as a child and discovered by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman, Boorman found the girl while she was on a daycare tour of the gymnasium where Boorman coached.
He has not lost a single multi-match match since the summer of 2013, and the winning streak is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina got into a small lead with two twists, it was like a mirage.
What was left were the boom and the floor, where Biles is the defending world champion.
He regained the lead after scoring 15,433 points from the pole position and crowned the result with 15,933 points from the floor.
Raisman hugged her gently as they waited for the final dots—a mere formality—and tears began to appear around Biles’ red, white, and blue glittering liner when the dream he had once written in his scrapbook came true.
Raisman’s performance was a small revenge for the competition four years ago, when he first split the third place but then lost the bronze to Mustafina in the re-round.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, whom the Americans call the team's "granny", was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent air kisses to the audience after his landing program and thus rose from a losing position to a winner, which at times seemed uncertain.
As for Biles, the widespread tweeting of this 19-year-old earlier this week is now taking on a whole new meaning:
Police say three serial killers who listened to music in the car were killed
Two women and a 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix’s most devastating massacre in 10 years, while the victims sat in a car chatting and listening to music when they were shot, police said Thursday.
Authorities say a car parked on the side of the street on June 12 was shot and killed by Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah.
The shooter stood on the passenger side of the car, fired eight shots with a handgun and then fled in another car.
Police suspect that the triple murder was not the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take any handbags or the $2,900 found in the possession of another adult victim.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said police were now investigating whether the killing was related to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two injured in nine attacks that have taken place in areas mostly populated by Hispanics within four months.
“What these events have in common is that they happened in residential areas in front of homes,” Howard told KPHO, a subsidiary of CBS.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The researchers do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are linked and that the perpetrators are the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to a hospital for his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah were killed at the scene.
A witness told police that the three had often sat in the car listening to music.
In addition, the police issued a statement announcing the shooting of an empty pickup truck just half an hour before the triple murder, and the shooter is believed to be the same in both cases.
Investigators found shell casings and recovered bullets from the car seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old boy with microcephaly: “Things are getting better”
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most people of his age, Edmund has microcephaly, or congenital microcephaly, caused by a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, was unaware of when she was pregnant.
“When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was that I wouldn’t get away with this.
I'm not gonna make it.
I didn't commit to this.
Which isn’t true at all – of course you’re committed to it,” he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and might not survive at all.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest that the child be institutionalized.
“My first reaction was that I didn’t think there was such a practice anymore,” says Picciuto.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
Edmund didn't start crawling until he was three years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's moving slowly at his own pace.
He walks with assistance and rides a bicycle.
He loves to play with his two brothers and he loves to sing.
Elizabeth introduces Edmund's idea of a sign that means "sing to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it is not just ordinary sign language; it also includes signs invented by Edmund himself.
Microcephaly can be caused by several different diseases: hereditary, as in the case of Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zika virus.
The symptoms and prognosis vary greatly.
It is still too early to assess how it will affect the lives of people infected with Zika virus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional storm caused by an uncertain future.
“I kept saying, ‘What will happen to us?
What will happen to us.”
And he still doesn't know.
"I haven't asked for a forecast in a long time because I don't think anyone can give it."
But Picciuto has hope-inspiring advice for mothers whose children have congenital defects caused by the Zika virus.
“Things are getting better.
Things have a way of working out.
You love your child, and your child loves you.”
Heavy rains and floods have led to large-scale rescue operations in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi
The governor of Louisiana on Friday declared a state of emergency due to heavy rains and widespread flooding. More rain is still expected in the state on Saturday.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flood their banks and spread over a wide area as a result of heavy rainfall.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help is on its way to flood areas.
Mike Steele, spokeswoman for the National Security and Emergency Response Agency, said the agency received requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags.
According to Steele, only Tangipahoa County has requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood warning will remain in place until Saturday in most of southern Louisiana.
According to the weather service, a further 76–127 mm of water may enter the area.
A flood warning was issued in southern Alabama on Friday as rain continued to fall in the Mobile area.
Over the weekend, the Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both of which in Louisiana, are projected to reach record highs.
According to weather forecaster Alek Krautmann, many houses along the rivers could be flooded in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
In addition, he says, downstream flooding in Ascension County poses a threat as flooded rivers slowly drain into Lake Maurepas.
In Liverpool, Louisiana, just south of the Mississippi border, the Tickfaw River had risen higher than ever at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue efforts continued in the Amite and Wilkinson counties of southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster earlier on Friday.
Hansford, 62, reports that the Beaver Creek River, which is normally more than 120 meters from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
The other half of the boy nearby had warned him.
“We got up, and the water came in on a constant feed,” Hansford says.
"It reached my waist."
She had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years she had lived in the area.
Hansford says that he and his family all have injuries and that he is the only one who can swim.
Rescue workers had rescued all three in a large army-style truck and taken them to a fire station in Gloster, where they held shelter on Friday.
Weather forecaster Krautmann says the floods are spreading rapidly as heavy rains continue, and authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He tells of a report from an observer near Livingston that it had rained nearly 350 mm between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil had become heavily wet after the rains that began Wednesday.
Authorities say heavy rains and street flooding have forced residents of Tangipahoa County to be rescued from their homes and school hours have been canceled in five school districts.
A member of the Tangipahoa City Council had told WWL, a subsidiary of CBS, that 200 homes were flooded.
Residents had been evacuated to two churches, but now both have been flooded.
County manager Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets who had been captured in the flood.
Shelters have been opened for the evacuees in the towns of Amite and Hammond.
"They get to go back to their homes when the water starts to recede," he says.
In the town of Hammond, nearly twenty streets in Tangipahoa County were closed due to flooding, and residents were offered sandbags to try to prevent water from entering their homes and businesses.
“The last time we experienced a major flood was in March,” said Lacy Landrum, a city council member.
"This flood appears to be similar."
In Mississippi, rain continued to fall steadily along the Gulf Coast, said Rupert Lacy, the emergency director of Harrison County.
Lacy said a handful of people were reported to have been flooded on Thursday, but so far no reports have been received on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods, says he has lived in the Amite area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places I’ve never seen it before, and it’s raining all the time.”
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown survives a Philadelphia shooting
According to police, a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, the second six-year-old boy to have been shot in the city this week.
The child's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia that the boy was Mahaj Brown.
According to the grandparents, the boy had multiple gunshot wounds to the groin, leg, arm and stomach, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He was hit many times, his little body was full of bullets," Delores Melendez, the boy's grandmother, told television.
"I can't believe this is happening."
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the television network that they believe the boy will survive.
He was starting first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people who were shot in the Germantown neighborhood.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man were also shot.
The other 29-year-old was reported to be in critical condition and the other two were stable, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found in the front seat of a car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are now investigating whether one of the wounded men may have been the shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crossfire between several armed men.
The scene was full of assault weapon-type shell casings, which come from different types of assault weapons.
“It is clear that this was an ongoing battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
There have been several armed fighters there and they have been actively involved in the shooting,” Chief Superintendent Anthony Ginaldi of the Philadelphia Police Department told the television station.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and police are reportedly going through surveillance videos.
Another six-year-old shot in the city this week was a girl who was hit by a stray bullet while playing outside her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood on Tuesday.
The girl is recovering and police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That’s what I call the women’s Olympic gymnastics team, and there’s more than one reason.
First of all, I’ve been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as overwhelming as it is now.
Secondly, the three gymnasts of this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many girls of color.
The team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team represents America at last.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latino women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the best female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were ranked 1st and 2nd.
This is awesome.
At the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas became the surprise winner of the Games, and all of America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the amazing performances of three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as well as surprising and masterful artistic gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth consecutive American to win gold in a women's singles multiple event.
Teammate Aly Raisman won the silver medal.
This is the view at the top of the sport, but it is not the same in gymnastics classes all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed in the same footsteps as Aly and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the last five ("Final Five"), as the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as a coach.
However, the reality is that artistic gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts mainly train in private artistic gymnastics clubs, which are maintained by their parents. Parents are responsible for the training costs, facilities, trips, performance outfits, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnasts and family members), etc.
Most of the artistic gymnastics clubs are located in prosperous residential areas that are able to support their activities.
The training of gymnasts takes place in these clubs, and it means an expensive and long-term commitment for the families of gymnasts.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both been coaching amateurs since they started gymnastics.
We need to provide cheaper and more accessible art gymnastics education to the countless young girls whose enthusiasm has been aroused by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
My organizations in Harlem have provided free or low-cost access to artistic gymnastics for more than 15,000 urban youth (mostly black and Hispanic), some of whom have won national and international championships.
In September, we will expand to my home city of Detroit to offer high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Artistic gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings lifelong benefits and supports good health and success in school and work.
This team has inspired thousands of young girls who now want to start gymnastics, and it’s absolutely amazing.
Participation in any sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the true "girl power" you showed in winning the Olympic gold medal, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start their journey to becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior Doctors Reject Jeremy Hunt's Proposal and Prepare for New Strikes
Ministers hoped to resolve the dispute over changes to pay and working conditions by approving a revised agreement with the British Medical Association (BMA), but 58% of the 37,000 junior doctors who voted rejected the proposal.
In July, Health Minister Hunt announced plans to force a deal and said the UK’s public health system (NHS) was “no-man’s-land” and that any further delay would be detrimental to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will move to a new agreement that includes changes to night and weekend work practices to improve health care during unsocial times.
Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA's junior medical committee, said in a statement last night: "Junior doctors remain very wary of the proposed agreement, with particular concern that it will exacerbate the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
It is only eight weeks until the first doctors are transferred to a new contract, so we need to move forward now, because time is running out.
The BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by talking, but the government has been reluctant to respond to the attempts at discussion, and sometimes even without reacting in any way.
Jeremy Hunt made a promise last month that his door would always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, reverse the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this does not happen, junior doctors will be ready for new industrial action."
The previous strike at the end of April delayed nearly 13,000 routine procedures and 100,000 appointments when nurses and consulting doctors were asked to join the strike guard in support of the striking doctors.
The ministers hoped to bring the dispute over the changes to an end by concluding a renewed agreement with British doctors' union officials.
The BMA wants a better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be covered by the agreement.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS employees, called on junior doctors not to strike again.
Mortimer says: “Work-related actions achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services that are already on the edge and cause concern, distress and disruption to patients, care workers and their families.
Over the last two months, we have been negotiating with the junior medical committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of supervisor and the disclosure of malpractices.
The employees were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics – such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from outages, training costs, curricular mutual recognition, study leave and the gender pay gap in the care sector – were a sign of how seriously the employees, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health want to stick to the agreements with the BMA concluded in November, February and May."
A drug that costs $2.40 a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack.
Thousands of heart attack patients are getting access to a drug that costs around €2.40 a day, when authorities recommended it be given to more people and for longer-term use.
The anticoagulation medicine ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The medicine is already being given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of having a stroke or another heart attack.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), a member of the NHS, has advised that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), now part of the NHS and evaluating the introduction of new treatments, has advised that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year in England, a quarter of whom have a heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty substances that build up in the walls of blood vessels and cause plaques.
If the plaque ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that prevents blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if a blood clot breaks off, it can travel with the blood stream and block the flow of blood to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new attack is higher in people who have had a heart attack once.
The ticagrelor manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the brand name Brilique reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of plugs.
The draft NICE guidance published today recommends that ticagrelor be administered at a dose of 90 mg for the next 12 months, followed by a reduction to 60 mg, and that aspirin be administered twice daily for an additional three years.
Carole Longson, professor at the Center for the Evaluation of the Advancement of Clinical Practice (NICE), says: “While there are effective treatments available that effectively prevent the progression of the disease and the onset of symptoms, up to a quarter of people who have a heart attack will have another attack or stroke – often with fatal consequences.
The fear of relapse can have a very negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
We have found evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation of temporary use of ticagrelor increases treatment options for the thousands of people who benefit from it."
Due to limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, in particular with regard to the risk of bleeding, when used for more than three years, the draft guidance does not recommend a longer duration of use.
The political correctness climate in Muslim areas has led to voter fraud
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was sacked last year for corruption, resulting in a government report.
A climate of political correctness has led to widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities, according to a government report released today.
Sir Eric Pickles, a former government minister, severely criticised the police, election observers and city councils for turning a blind eye to electoral fraud "because of hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
According to Mr Pickles, a former Minister of Regional Administration and current anti-corruption figure, the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that the police should have been allowed to form chains of guards outside the polling stations in order to protect the intimidated voters.
He suggests that voters should present an identity card in order to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At the moment, voters only need to state their name and address.
In addition, the report proposes that the fingers be dipped in indelible ink after voting, so that no one can vote twice.
Whistleblowers should be better protected, says Sir Eric.
He calls for improved access for journalists to government documents and to the decisions of informal committees and working groups.
"The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to combat corruption and fraud against financial interests and the culture that favours them more widely in local governments," he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report on East London after the Tower Hamlet voting scandal.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled that the then mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be dismissed for corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The court ruled that Rahman “sarcastically misrepresented” the religious sentiment of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and anti-Islamism.
Rahman was said to base his campaign on the fact that it was the religious duty of every Muslim believer to vote for him.
Up to 300 of the votes were questionable or given fraudulently, so that the person voted by pretending to be another person.
According to Sir Eric, there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about the post-election fraud in which senior members of the Muslim community were reported to have pressured people to vote for a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric (pictured) made several suggestions to clean up the voting system, including requiring identification at the polling station.
The report says: 'There is evidence that some vulnerable members of ethnic minority groups, in particular women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of older members, especially in communities with a Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.'
"There was concern that ... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such practices because of their "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including banning political activists from handling postal ballots in order to prevent “voice harvesting.”
The Theresa May report currently under consideration also calls for stricter checks on registration in order to prevent the use of the voting register for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consideration of alternatives to requiring voters to present an identity card before voting.
Immersion of fingers in indelible ink after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to verify the nationality and voting rights of voters.
Setting a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibition of political activists from handling filled-in votes sent by post and envelopes for voice mail.
The police have the right to form security chains around polling stations.
Amending the Act to make it easier to prosecute intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Ban on photography at polling stations.
Only allow English at polling stations (excluding Wales).
Reinforcement of training to ensure staff control over the rule that only one person at a time is allowed to enter the voting booth.
Sir Eric strongly criticises the London police and finds it "astonishing" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlet incident.
"The electoral court dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representative from office for corruption and numerous illegal practices," he said.
“He was found guilty without any reasonable doubt and the criminal evidence threshold was exceeded on many grounds.”
He also criticised the ineffective "cross-checks" of the City Council's electoral directorates.
“The Court’s decision last year in the Tower Hamlet case was a wake-up call,” said Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its heritage as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the disturbing and cover-up of electoral fraud and its denial by some."
Olympic cyclist's resemblance to Duchess Catherine and other doppelgangers at Rio Olympics
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics went wild this week with French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge is astonishing.
But according to discussions on social media, this 24-year-old Olympic representative is by no means the only champion athlete with a resemblance to a well-known person.
In honor of the Rio Games and all the well-known faces flickering on our screens, FEMAIL compiled a list of all the Olympic champions whose resemblance to Hollywood celebrities is obvious.
The Hunter and the Wolf: The U.S. men’s archery team Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to the duchess Catherine’s doppelganger on the cycling tracks, many people have listed on social media how one archer could be the twin brother of actor-favorite Leonardo DiCaprio.
The U.S. men's archery team Brady Ellison caused a storm after pictures posted on Twitter of him, in which he bears a striking resemblance to the star of the Wolf of Wall Street movie.
Ellison was aware of the social media noise and admitted hearing from a young age that he resembled DiCaprio.
“I personally don’t see the resemblance as big, except maybe for the beard and the mustache,” Brady told The Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take this as a compliment."
At the London 2012 Games, the similarity between the British long jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris was raised, which will no doubt be highlighted even more in these competitions.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina has been described as the doppelganger of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Matthew Morrison for years.
This user says Nathan Adrian is the "athlete version" of the actor in the film Inception.
Similarly, the resemblance between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett has long been noted, which is highlighted by the powerful eyebrows and lips of both.
Russian swimmer Yulia Efimova resembles actress Annalynne McCord, and not just because of her beautifully tanned skin and blonde hair, while US team Nathan Adrian is, according to fans, an "athlete version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt".
The two iron women, football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter series actress Jennifer Carpenter (right), resemble each other in facial shapes and eyes.
Not only that: this Twitter user was delighted when others saw the resemblance as well.
This user is wondering if there is a good reason for the pair resemblance.
One tweeter recently expressed his delight when "others on the internet agree on the resemblance between Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter".
The American football star and the actor of the Dexter series really strikingly resemble each other in the shape of their faces and eyes.
Many have also noticed a resemblance between the smiles of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney and the wide smiles of gold-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas and the star of Let’s Go! Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic Commentator Apologizes for Saying Chinese Swimmer 'Dead Like a Pig'
Byron MacDonalds’ analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan’s fourth place in a women’s 4x200m freestyle relay shocked viewers of CBC’s live Olympic report on Wednesday.
Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "disappeared smelling" and "died like a pig" during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone had been turned off when he began to express his own opinions at the end of the women’s 4 x 200m freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who was brought into the CBC commentary team to bring color, was heard to say, "This little 14-year-old Chinese dick, baby.
He was too excited, he left fast, and he died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the message at 1:57.79, and missed 1.61 seconds of Taylor Ruck in Canada, allowing Canadians to swim into China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly after being shocked by the tone and language of the commentator.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC reporter just say a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig???
The idiot didn't realize he was on the air yet."
In the final of the women’s 4 x 200m freestyle relay, Ai Yanhan, a Chinese swimmer, was described with the following words: “This little 14-year-old Chinese dick, baby.
Twitter was quickly filled with furious criticism of Byron MacDonald, and many called for his dismissal.
The tweeters didn’t hold back when they heard how reckless Byron Macdonald was.
Tweeter Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a racist bunch.
CBC host Scott Russell quickly apologized for MacDonald's remarks, saying: "We apologize for the comment on the swim performance.
It was an unfortunate choice of words and we are sorry that this has happened."
The CBC eventually had to apologize more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Commentator Scott Russell was forced to apologize on MacDonald's behalf.
The CBC then copied and glued its apologies to more than 90 other tweeters complaining about MacDonald’s remarks.
The company quickly issued a public apology.
"We sincerely apologize for these statements and for their inclusion in the broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on last night’s broadcast, and we also apologized to our social media followers.
To be clear, Byron’s comments had to do with the swimmer’s performance, not him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was unfortunate, and Byron is very sorry for his words."
On Thursday night, MacDonald apologized on the air and tried to justify his remarks by saying he didn’t mean it personally.
“I want to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women’s relay swim,” MacDonald said on CBC’s Olympic broadcast.
"I was referring to the swimmer's performance, not the person.
Needless to say, I didn’t mean anything derogatory in what I said, and I’m very sorry.”
In Primark, uninhibited underwear in the middle of the store arranged by a woman shocked customers
Customers didn’t know where to look when a woman undressed in the middle of Primark to try on underwear.
He further exacerbated the situation by assessing what he looked like in his underwear, taking them off his feet and putting them back on the shelf.
He went on touring and finally tried on four pairs of underwear at a store in Folkestone, at Bouverie Place.
A Primark chain store in Folkestone’s Bouverie Place shopping mall, where a woman tried on underwear in front of everyone and put it back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two who was in the store at the same time, says that after trying on underwear, an unknown woman dressed up and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He said: “People couldn’t believe their eyes.
The woman stood in the middle of the store, took her underwear off the shelf, took off her own tights and underwear and put them on.
He did not try to do it unnoticed, but he did it without shame.
Everyone stared as he took off the underwear he was wearing, and apparently he didn't like it because he put it back on the shelf.
He did it three more times before finally deciding he didn’t like anything, got dressed and walked out.
He didn’t seem to care about looks – nor did he think of a person who would eventually buy the underwear he had tried on.”
Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent Town, said: “How disgusting it is to think that someone is taking home underwear that someone else has worn and hasn’t been washed.”
The incident occurred Tuesday afternoon.
“I understand that the store staff tried to remove those items of clothing from sale after the woman had left – which is correct.
It would be terrible to take your new underpants home and find that someone else has tried them on without washing them afterwards,” adds Davidson.
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark is aware of the situation at its Folkestone store on Tuesday 9 August.
All these products have been withdrawn from sale."
How to defend yourself from an armed attack with Krav Maga
The world is full of dangers, but this video at Dailymail.com can help make it a bit safer.
We interviewed the Grand Master of the Krav Maga League in New York, Rhon Mizrach, and asked for advice on how to cope with a robber or abuser waving a gun at close range.
The video shows you how to defend against an attacker, depending on whether the attacker approaches you from the front or from behind.
If the attacker approaches from behind, the first thing you need to do is turn around to see the attacker and get off the firing line, says Mizrachi.
Then grab the weapon between your elbow and upper arm and strike the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Then kick the assailant in the groin with his knee, and when he goes out of pain twice, slap him in the face with the barrel of the gun and back away by holding the gun aimed at him.
The technique is equivalent if an armed attacker approaches from the front. You need to move away from the firing line, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, place your weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest. Turn the gun away from the attacker, retreat and keep the gun aimed at the attacker.
Does that sound difficult?
Watch the video to see how Mizrachi does it.
However, remember that the safest way to get rid of a robber is to hand over your cash – unless you are a Krav Maga Grand Master.
World travel guide Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe
The British globetrotter put his resistance and gag reflex to the test by licking the dirtiest and most repulsive places in Europe.
Ian Wright, 51, a Suffolk presenter and travel guide, wanted to prove the strength of his resistance by licking a euro banknote, a handrail in Piccadilly Circus, a toilet flush button on a train, and a Russian public telephone.
Before licking, Wright measured the objects with a luminometer to see for himself and show viewers where he was sticking his tongue.
The experiment was turned into a documentary film, Ian Wright: The Traces of Inner Power, and the results were surprising.
The idea of licking the toilet flush button on the train can be disgusting, but in fact, more germs are in the kitchen sink.
On his journey across Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals about strengthening the good bacteria in the gut and about his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked caused anything but a foul-smelling mouth.
Ian Wright was originally known for his travel program in which he tested his gut endurance by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
No doubt, licking the railings in railway stations and the flush button in the toilet challenged Wright’s resistance.
Wright says in the documentary, "I've been pretty carefree about my health since I was a kid, and I've put stuff in my mouth like dirt and worms and mud."
In the film, he proved his worth.
The border was met only in a filthy public toilet in Russia.
The luminometer measured more than 4,000 units of the sample.
For comparison, the number in newly washed hands is usually less than 60.
The border met in a Russian public restroom, where Wright refused to lick, when the luminometer measured 4,000 units – in freshly washed hands the same number is less than 60.
Wright and Valio co-produced the documentary Ian Wright – Traces of Inner Power, which makes visible the amount of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the documentary, "This is almost the worst smell I've ever smelled in any bathroom.
4000 units, nothing is dirtier than that!
The place is so disgusting that I don't really lick anything here."
Wright produced the documentary film Ian Wright – In Search of Inner Power in collaboration with Valio.
Wright received Valio Gefilus from Valio, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which helps to strengthen the gut’s good bacteria and resistance.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio’s category manager for snacks, juices and new products, says: “We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time tells about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time brainstorming something crazy, and we ended up thinking about asking Ia to come along.”
Intestinal health has become a global trend.
“Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to bring them into a wider context and talk about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it relates to resistance.
Intestinal health has become a global trend, and the document allows us to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
The film also tells about our sense of humor!”
Tom Hakala, the director of the film, adds: "It is said that I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked certain items we asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet that is also shown in the film.
Naturally, some of the items were easier for Ian to lick, while others were pretty bad.
I'm glad we were able to get some of the dirty licks on tape."
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 per cent of the respondents associated lactic acid bacteria with the well-being of the stomach and intestines in particular, and 58 per cent said that they had used products to which lactic acid bacteria have been added at least occasionally.
Before being evicted, a dysfunctional family destroyed a town-owned tenement in Saltash, Cornwall.
The family left behind <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 in damage to a city-owned tenement building after being evicted for neighborhood terror.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock have been evicted from their flat in Saltash, Cornwall, after numerous complaints against the couple.
When the couple had been forcibly removed from the apartment, the representatives of the rental housing company stated that the apartment was in a state of renovation.
There were gaping openings in the walls, floorboards had been torn off, debris had been spread on the floors, and the walls had been stained with graffiti.
The couple have now moved in and are believed to be living in a private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, head of Cornwall Housing, said she feared the house could no longer be salvaged.
He says, “This has been a complete nightmare for the people who live here, no one should have to put up with this.
There’s a lot to weigh up, as the property is likely to become known as a less-than-pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, as is its name."
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment from time to time. According to police, the family’s reign of terror included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, use and care of drugs, and loud shouting, arguing and swearing.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the lease, was ordered to behave antisocially in June.
Old waste was found in several rooms of the house under demolition threat.
Previously, drugs had been sold in the house, and floorboards had been torn off.
Neighbors said the family was fighting on the street and police had to be called on a regular basis.
The couple were forcibly evicted by Cornwall’s Housing Department this week after being given an 11-week extension to voluntarily emigrate.
Reliefed neighbors were grateful for the eviction —they said their life was hell on earth.
One of the neighbors says, “They didn’t care about anybody.
We’ve lived next door to them for 20 years, and it’s been hard all that time.
The police have been here an incredible number of times.”
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we are not used to it!
It will be wonderful now that they have finally been evicted."
Adam Fitzpatrick, director of enforcement at Cornwall’s Housing Department, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which time the police were regularly called.
Trash and old toys had been thrown on the wild wall of the rental house.
Fitzpatrick adds: “It is a pity that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his or her own and their family’s behaviour, as eviction is always the last measure that the Cornwall Housing Department is considering.
This incident was extremely difficult, as the behavior was extreme and their actions must have been shocking to the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my team, the Devon and Cornwall police and community members who took part in the work and bravely offered to give us information.
I hope that this progress will improve the well-being of our neighbours and send a message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated."
Fitzpatrick says that the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but were already in their twenties.
Dirty mattress found in one bedroom after eviction
Housing workers must now clean up the piles of rubbish surrounding the house.
Police raided the home in 2014 and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, as well as scales and other supplies, and <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was found guilty of possession of a Class B drug for the purpose of selling it.
He claimed the money was for the gravestone of his son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Since becoming homeless, Skeldon and her husband have been reported to have moved into a private apartment in Plymouth.
The walls of many of the rooms were covered with graffiti.
Police say they are demanding eviction of tenants who violate the lease rules.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police says this eviction serves as a clear warning to tenants who are constantly defying the rules.
"This is a clear message to those who think they can behave the way they want to without being prosecuted, as well as to those who have to suffer from such behavior," says Crow.
The Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour, and will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
A low-flying, beach-gripped military jet scared tourists off in Portugal
Sun worshippers experienced the shock of their lives in Aveiro, Portugal.
The P-3C Orion jet of the Portuguese Air Force crashed at a staggeringly low altitude.
According to the Air Force, this was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The image shows a moment when tourists panicked when a low-flying jet crashed over a full beach.
The dramatic images show how an army plane comes within almost contact with tourists sunbathing on the sandy beach in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers got up on their feet, understandably worried by the roar of the jet engines that began to sound before they could see what was coming through the clouds.
The incident took place yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
One of the vacationers who photographed the dramatic flyby and posted the videos on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who says, “It passed the beach twice really low, and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash to the ground.”
Nuno Arroja adds: "I was surfing and I was sure that the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on the beach at Aveiro were shocked when the plane suddenly came into view and flew at a staggeringly low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify coastal fishing vessels, which is why the plane had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly slightly lower than normal, because the smoke caused by nearby forest fires impaired visibility, but according to the Air Force, this did not threaten anyone’s safety.
The fires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that due to the poor visibility caused by heavy fog and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The plane was on a training flight, during which the pilot was asked to identify the fishing boats.
Eksote’s first half-year result better than expected
The Social and Health Care District of South Karelia (Eksote) reported a EUR 3.4 million better-than-planned result in January-June.
Eksote posted a surplus of EUR 4.3 million in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has enabled the dismantling of institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was fulfilled in all operations.
Eksote aims to shorten the waiting lists this year.
Eksote covers the previously created deficit by covering the surplus.
The remainder may be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The full-year result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
Eksote’s Board of Directors will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special border soldiers take military oath in Immola
The 70 conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School took the military oath on Friday.
The Military Ceremony of the Border and Coast Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Special Frontier Jaeger Course was held on the garrison’s sports field.
Seventy soldiers were sworn in.
Special Border Guards are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for the position.
250 of them were invited to the tests.
Special Border Jaegers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans of the wartime frontier forces were present at the meeting organised in connection with the oath ceremony.
The average age of the participants is now 90 years old.
The oldest veterans who participated in the event were born in 1918.
Criminal intelligence helps to solve crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
Each of Finland’s 11 police departments has had a Criminal Intelligence and Analysis Unit (RTA) since the beginning of 2014.
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
At the Häme Police Department, the unit consists of a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's run by a sergeant stationed in the Bay.
The Chief of Staff is Lieutenant Lahti.
In addition, the unit’s strength includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in civilian clothes.
The unit has proved its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides the rest of the police with various reports.
In Häme, it has, among other things, obtained information on asylum seekers.
Reform of the latest working methods
The establishment of analysis units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. that the police would not leave the swamps until they received an alert.
With the help of the information collected and analysed by the unit, daily policing is targeted where it is most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, a criminal intelligence centre was established in the country, with less than three national units and a criminal intelligence unit for each police station.
The PTR Centre, which operates in connection with the Central Criminal Police in Vantaa, leads operations nationwide.
As the name suggests, the PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and the Border Guard.
The RTA units, in turn, work in areas divided by police departments and have the task of providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Inquiries extend beyond your own territory
While an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is happening throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the borders of one’s own institution, because so does crime.
Those working in the RTA unit have computer skills better than the basic police.
The unit aims to draw the police’s attention to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes with the help of registers, alert task databases and observations.
This is called serialization and is one of the most important criminal intelligence tools.
Everyone has their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it is honest or criminal.
Based on the method, a certain image is formed of the perpetrator.
The serialization can be done either on the basis of the method or on the basis of the person, depending on which of the police has more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not walk around the city with their collars up, but their work is not completely public either.
The methods used by both criminals and criminals are not disclosed, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus trying to prevent the police from trying to combat crime.
The police will publicly disclose the methods if they pose a threat.
Such an incident was, for example, the marking method used in home burglaries in the early summer.
In it, the workers put a stick, pin, or piece of tape on the front door of the apartment to test whether the residents were really traveling.
The pre-trial investigation material is public at least to the parties.
The Analysis Unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they make.
The cleverest ones order the district court’s minutes, which may indicate, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the place.
Next time, we'll go to the thieves with gloves on.
The interviewees were Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppä from the Häme Police Department, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police Department, Inspector Sami Joutjärvi from the Joensuu Police Station and Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police Department.
The police collect and analyse information to plan practical actions.
This is due to a decrease in the amount of labour and funding.
The first steps towards a new way of working were taken already 30 years ago.
The most recent change was the three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation is used to collect information from outside the home institution and Finland’s borders.
A London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria.
It is reported that one of the three British schoolchildren who joined ISIS last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family heard that Sultana died in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in a Russian airstrike on Raqqa, an ISIS base in Syria, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, was planning to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"One can only hope that this will serve as a cautionary example and a testament to people's understanding that this is a real risk when they go into a war zone - and one that makes people give up their decision to leave," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London schoolgirls boarded a plane to Turkey and continued by bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and had become a widow only a few months after the wedding.
Reid Says Clinton Will Support Garland's Appointment to Supreme Court if He Gets Elected
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is convinced Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court of Justice if he is elected president.
Senate Republicans have refused to confirm Garland’s nomination since Barack Obama appointed him in March.
According to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the next president will select the person to fill the post of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a teleconference on Thursday that he predicts Clinton will choose Garland “with some degree of certainty.”
Reid's spokesman later clarified that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly with Clinton about whether he was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said the Clinton team would not want to "rock the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reid said the Republicans blocking Garland's nomination were "commanders" and "helpers" to presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is not fit for office.
Treats magazine says nude calendars belong to women as well as men
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere and launches a calendar for 2017 inspired by Pirelli, made in the style of the 1970s.
Instead of celebrity cipher models, they want to find the next generation of high-end models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats CEO Steve Shaw said earlier this year that his nudity-filled magazine was different from the old-school Playboy, saying: “Playboy is for men.
I do this for women.”
Apparently, he thinks the same way about the calendar.
“We need to bring back a timeless and classic nudity where women, just like men, can effortlessly enjoy and be inspired by these images that glorify the female body,” Shaw said in a press release.
"Women will definitely want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful work of art."
As a model for the calendar, you can submit your photos online or participate in open selections in Los Angeles and New York.
The charm of vinyl: who buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyl.
Before you can post your angry protest in the comments section, under the name of NotAllLonelyMiddle-aged Men, this claim is based on actual research data.
According to the research company YouGov, the reason behind the much-discussed re-emergence of vinyl records is not the millennial generation’s boom, when millennials want to feel a physical object in their hands, but instead the underlying nostalgia of middle age.
The person who recently purchased a vinyl album is most likely between the ages of 45-54.
In fact, those in the 18-24 age group are the least likely buyers.
It’s also not just a matter of hobbyists wanting to grab records, but it’s an emotional one: older vinyl record buyers are a little more likely to hide their feelings (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog was a televised newscast, the camera would follow me as I walked along bustling Soho Street, wearing a glamorous gray jacket. I would gesture briskly, bend my hand into a cup, and say something traditional like, “Let’s find out.”
So let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and roughness, as hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over before the holdings owned by private entrepreneurs, there are still a handful of specialty record stores left.
I would probably ask the cameraman to stop the camera for a moment as I get very close to the men visiting these shops and try to observe their age and temperament.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, who I follow from Sister Ray (currently two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (currently eight middle-aged men, one woman probably in her twenties) is on a meeting trip to London for the afternoon and spends his extra time exploring the shops.
I asked if he was a collector.
"I think I am," he says.
"I've got about 3,000 to 4,000 records."
These plates fill his living room walls, as you can see from the photo. (Stuart sent the picture to me by e-mail, I did not follow him home.)
The reason why he has acquired such a large number of albums and singles is partly due to his disposable income. He is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they first appeared, and again buy things that he had to sell when he was young and penniless.
"I get a lot of late '60s and early '70s stuff that came up when I was 11 or 12 and probably too young to get them," she says.
He agrees that those who buy vinyl records are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and adds, “I don’t smoke and I don’t drink much.
It's my vice."
Wez, 25, who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of their customers fit the YouGov profile.
However, he has noticed a new kind of flow of people who have been affected by media hype. These people have heard of vinyl records coming back and now feel compelled to buy their old records back.
"Based on the conversations I had, people tended to give up their collections around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their vinyl back,” he says.
This may explain the boom in vinyl-whiskers of a certain age.
What, though, about the supposed emotional significance of records?
In just a few seconds, in a movement like Phonica, you realize that they provide a comforting community for like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers are particularly upset about the contactless payment system.
The digital world may overwhelm some vinyl fans, for whom going back to their familiar record cases means permanence and reminds them of the happy days of their youth.
“I think it sometimes fills a gap or acquires material possessions for some kind of comfort,” says Wez.
"I see it as a collector myself, and I think so do many others.
It’s an easy way to get your mind off things.”
“We’re like social workers!” yells Wez’s co-worker from behind the pile of records.
An ICM opinion poll conducted in April revealed that nearly 50% of those who bought a vinyl album the previous month had not yet listened to the album.
The poll also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, and 7% of vinyl record buyers don’t have a record player of their own at all.
At this point in the newscast I would probably show a serious face while browsing through stacked bossa nova collections.
The re-emergence of vinyl records is also accompanied by the "pocalypse" phenomenon that Jonny, 42, a salesman for the Sounds of the Universe movement (currently three middle-aged men), has observed.
“A customer recently came into the store and said he doesn’t have a record player, but he wants to buy a Radiohead record so he can put it on his shelf,” Jonny says.
“It’s not a big deal, but there are customers.
For them, materiality is more important than music.
Some of our customers say they don’t have a record player yet.
They’re younger, not older, mostly teenagers who are just starting out.”
The customer base is much more varied in Foppi, where I will arrive next. The store has dedicated a whole layer to vinyl records.
Customers include couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The variety of customers delights, even if the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in the previous stores: instead of rocking jazz, the speakers are buzzing with the latest sex-filled synthesizer pop from Wild Beasts.
None of the customers seem particularly lonely, but it is difficult to detect the gnawing psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fopp for a few minutes and looking at different discounted albums.
He's more interested in watching than shopping.
He says his income is low, so collecting records is not possible for him.
"They cost a lot.
It is easy to listen to music on the computer or otherwise, but the fineness of the wine is ..." he sighs with delight and continues:
"I can't explain it, they're so unique."
My last stop is the store that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I see a bunch of teenage girls who think they're jumping around in denim shorts, but who instead gather around the Polaroid cameras for a moment, and I see a father and a daughter thinking about buying a Crosley turntable.
On the left is a staircase, the wall of which is filled with records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, central records for any average collection.
No one looks at the wall, maybe because they are just a decorative element and some of them are so high that they can’t even be reached.
They are pure "art vinyl" interior.
But given that all the means to get attention on these boards may mean more money for the industry and sending a few customers on a search trip to Soho, there’s little to complain about.
It’s no surprise that the population group most likely to have more time and money than most is also the group that spends the most money on luxuries like vinyl records.
While my research shows that YouGov’s findings are true, at least in Soho’s record stores, they don’t rule out the large number of female collectors and vinyl fans that actually exist in both record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely involved in school or work.
They certainly do not spend their Thursday mornings hanging out at the Berwick Street record stores, browsing through records and avoiding the 30-year-old who plays a TV presenter who looks frighteningly at and glances at unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holkeri is the longest living vertebrate – video report
According to scientists, the longest living vertebrate on Earth is the ice shark.
According to shark researcher Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice shark in the study was found to be between 272 and 512 years old, a five-metre-long female.
French Court Rejects Request to Dismantle Jungle Camp Stores
A French court has rejected a request from the Calais authorities to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in a jungle camp populated by thousands of refugees.
In a court hearing this week in Calais, the authorities argued that the state should be allowed to break up the 72 temporary shops set up in the refugee camp, which sell various goods from tobacco to energy drinks to the residents of the refugee camp and offer haircuts. In the temporary restaurants, you can buy tea for 50 cents or basic meals for a few euros.
According to the prefects of Calais, these shops and restaurants must be dismantled because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent the grey economy and because they present fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian aid teams told the court that shops and restaurants are essential to the camp, as the free meals provided by the state-sponsored organization and others are not enough for the growing population of the camp.
They say that temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need.
The Court of Justice of Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of the 72 temporary dealers, but considered the concerns of the Prefect of Calais "fully understandable".
Justice Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said the camp's grocery stores, cafes and restaurants were "much more important than just providing food to people living in extremely unstable conditions."
He says they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet.
One of the places under threat of demolition was the camp’s Jungle Book Kids café, which is non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, and asylum advice for the hundreds of unaccompanied minors in the camp, who are in the most vulnerable position.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition demanding that the children's cafe be preserved.
According to a letter to the Guardian, closing it “would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old.”
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that after a sharp increase in arrivals this summer, the population of the jungle camp has risen to a record high of more than 9,000.
Food prices in Finland fall clearly faster than the EU average
Food prices in Finland are falling sharply to the delight of consumers and the annoyance of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by nearly five per cent in three years, while in the EU countries, on average, its price has fallen by 0.9 per cent.
Meanwhile, in Germany and Sweden, food has become one percent more expensive.
Over the past three years, the price of food in Finland has fallen to second place among the EU countries with wage levels similar to those in Finland.
In comparison, only in the UK has the price of food fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are based on an article by Ilkka Lehtinen, Head of Development at Statistics Finland, published on the Tieto & Trends blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices that are related to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data are from June of this year.
In the early 2010s, the price of food rose sharply.
In 2013 prices were close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
“We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership,” Lehtinen says.
Then came a turning point, after which the food has become cheaper year by year.
The price is now being weighed down by Russia’s food import bans, which have halted food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have decreased.
“Putin’s policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term,” Lehtinen says.
Tighter price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
The large retail chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For consumers, price competition has been reflected in spectacular advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not a haven for cheap food, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland among the EU countries with wage levels similar to those in Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the comparison countries had the same VAT rate, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with the same wage level.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, the UK, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate in comparison countries were seven per cent, only Germans and Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finns.
“If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in the price of food, VAT must be halved to the EU countries’ average and the price competition will continue,” Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that his calculations on the VAT rate are indicative.
School is no longer what it used to be.
Those who return to school may notice that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been prepared for schools, which will be introduced in all primary schools at the beginning of the semester.
It is a guideline that all Finnish schools should follow.
The schools themselves decide the details, but the plan states the official goals.
The new guidelines have been prepared for several years, and they differ from the old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, learning cursive writing will be abandoned, and instead schools will begin to practice coding.
Swedish education begins in the sixth grade at the latest, and social studies begins in the fourth grade.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of students.
It used to be thought that teachers teach students, but now everyone has to be active and learn from each other.
This is how we try to make school more interesting.
World's longest vertebrate found, ice shark may live up to 400 years
The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) does not reach sexual maturity until it is 150 years old.
It could live another 250 years, according to a new study.
These numbers make it the longest-living vertebrate in the world today.
In the animal kingdom, it is only passed by an Icelandic mussel, whose oldest known specimen is dated to 507 years old.
Greenland sharks swim across the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than males, they can grow up to five metres tall.
Because the rate of growth is slow, according to surveys only about one centimeter per year, adult individuals have by necessity lived for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He measured the ages of adult ice sharks from 28 females caught in fishermen’s nets.
The age of the fish was revealed by radiocarbon dating.
The average age of the sharks tested was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 493- and 502-centimeter-long Amazon fins, were found to be about 335 and 392 years old, respectively.
Since previous studies have found that ice stork females reach sexual maturity only when they are over four metres tall, the researchers calculated that they are around 150 years old at that point.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann sacks nearly 300 - sellers not reduced
Nearly 300 employees will be laid off from the department store company Stockmann.
The joint ventures in the troubled company ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of the negotiations, about 300 jobs will be cut, the majority of which will be implemented in the form of redundancies," Stockmann said in a statement.
According to this, the number of sellers of department stores will not be reduced, so that customer service will not suffer.
In addition, around 80 employees in support functions will be offered new jobs as sellers.
Stockmann’s co-operation negotiations concerned approximately 3,000 employees.
When they started, the need for reduction was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The population reduction is aimed at annual cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million, which are expected to be realised during the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme that aims to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background is Stockmann’s difficulties in making department store trade profitable.
Although the Group’s adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the department store trade is still loss-making.
According to Stockmann’s acting CEO Lauri Veijalainen, sales in department stores have not met the company’s targets.
"Unfortunately, personnel reductions are necessary to ensure a positive operating result for Stockmann Retail in 2018," said Veijalainen.
The second quarter result improvement was mainly due to the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best ever second-quarter revenue and result.
Lindex’s operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
In the same period last year, the entire Stockmann Group recorded a loss of 4.1 million euros.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday will be the rainiest in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees throughout the country
The low-pressure centre in the northern part of Finland will keep the weather rainy on Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
There will also be rain showers in the central part of the country, but there will be cascades further south.
The temperature is not very summery anymore, as the mercury is below 20 degrees Celsius in the whole country.
In the rainy areas of the north will remain at 10-15 degrees.
Kenya's athletics team is rocked by doping scandal - a strange explanation for the coach's action
Kenyan athletics coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it was revealed that Anzrah appeared as a national team athlete in a doping test.
The Associated Press reported that the athlete Anzrah was trying to appear in is the 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya's national team, said Anzrah's identity was revealed after he gave Rotich a sample in a surprise test.
Doping officials reported to the authorities in Anzrah.
Soi said Anzrah was sent home because he "committed his crime against the Kenyan national team".
He posed as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour," Kenyan Olympic Committee chairman Kip Keino told Reuters.
The Olympic track and field starts on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run at that time.
It is not yet known if the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth at the World Championships last year and is Rio’s favourite pre-winner.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan athletics team claimed that Anzrah traveled with the athlete’s accreditation card only to receive free meals at the race village.
When anti-doping officials confronted him, they assumed he was an athlete and took him to a test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials, because he was afraid to be revealed," the source said.
Where's everybody at?
Rio’s athletics stadium is empty
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium watching athletics.
Rio began the fight for the athletics medals on Friday, but the world’s top individuals were allowed to showcase their skills to a bewilderingly empty crowd.
Rio organizers said Friday that only 58 percent of the first day’s morning and 65 percent of the evening’s tickets had been sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium was full of cheering people.
Tickets for the finals are already sold out in Rio.
The loss of spectators at the Rio Olympics has attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been seen in the stands of rugby, canoeing and horseback riding.
When Brazil’s Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the stadium was full.
After the Brazilian pair, the Netherlands played against Russia, and only about 30 percent of the 12,000-seat crowd was full.
The poor performance is at least explained by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with economic difficulties, is far from home to European and Asian competition tourists, and many Olympic sports are strange to Brazilians accustomed to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team did not complete the football stadium.
Race organisers spokesman Mario Andrada said at the weekend that 82% of the tickets had been sold at the time, which is clearly lower than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million left to sell," Andrada said.
Of the 8.5 million tickets sold at the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, although tickets cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have ranged from around nine euros to over a thousand euros at the opening.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but in Rio this is not yet allowed, because the organizers need money and are trying to sell tickets until the last minute.
However, in Rio, organizers have given 240,000 tickets to school children in the country for lesser-known sports such as golf and rugby.
Rio’s stadium had plenty of empty seats this morning.
Not even a beach volleyball on the sands of Copacabana has interested the audience.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.
The people in the gallery were enough.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation in new ways.
The foundation, established last year, acquires ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, private individuals, companies and communities can use the money to redeem the title rights to the land.
The foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land is virtually divided into parcels, which can be acquired by those who wish to acquire the right of ownership for a fee.
The holder will be given the right to veto its 187 square metre block, which in practice means that approval from each holder is not required if the use of the land is to be changed.
You can also acquire holder rights for more than one block.
The acquisition of the right of possession is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or a gift.
You don’t have to carry banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature,” says Juha Leviäkangas, who has acquired the right of possession for his company.
A person who has acquired the right of possession receives precise location information from the block, which enables, for example, a visit to the block.
The Foundation’s website displays the names of the holders on the same map as the parcel of land.
Leviäkangas sees only the fact that the Foundation’s operations will change from its original idea as a risk in its nature conservation procurement.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a non-profit foundation with the purpose of promoting the protection of the environment and nature.
There is a risk that the foundation would act in some way unethical or commercially, but this should not be possible.
Helsinki Foundation’s Haltija project is based on the idea of protecting nature areas so that they can be untouched and in peace.
The Foundation acquires land either by purchase or as a donation.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of property rights, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims beyond Finland’s borders and plans to acquire land in Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop-up forest at the Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
Bike thieves are the worst tormentors of big cities in Turku - see the situation in your municipality
Bicycle thieves torment Turku the most of Finland’s big cities.
This year, more bikes have been stolen in proportion to the population than in nine other major cities.
Based on the bicycle thefts reported to the police, Helsingin Sanomat investigated how many bicycles and their parts were stolen in the ten largest cities in January-August of this year per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to police, there were four to five bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
In Espoo and Kouvola, on the other hand, only about two bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants were reported to the police.
It's a big difference, isn't it?
“In some cities, in proportion to the population, there is a double number of thefts compared to others,” Tommi Reen, a police inspector at the National Police Board, describes.
The police are wondering why the city is at the top of the rankings.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
"The frequency of theft can be affected by how many people ride bikes in the city and how many bikes there are," says Sergeant Teemu <0xC3><0x84>ikäs.
The National Police Board’s Tommi Reen considers it highly expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will rise to the top in the comparison.
The number of bike thefts largely depends on the cities of study and cycling.
Turku has a dense city centre, short distances and plenty of bikes available for thieves.
"Espoo, for example, is a completely different type of city, where urban centres are far apart and bicycles are not necessarily the primary means of transport," Reen says.
In the whole of Finland, slightly fewer bicycle thefts were reported to the police in January-August than in the corresponding period of last year.
But there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police report a little over 20,000 bicycle thefts a year.
That means 50-60 bikes every day and in Helsinki alone about 4,000 bikes a year.
“It’s a lot of money,” Reen said.
In reality, thieves take more bikes, as only some of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen calls on people to report a bicycle theft, even though fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police survives.
A typical solved bicycle theft is one in which the police are informed of the theft immediately and the thief is caught red-handed.
"Cases are also revealed in connection with other investigations, when, for example, in a drug case, stolen bikes can be found in the apartment," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly in the act itself or in connection with a police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bicycles are stolen, for example, from bike racks in shopping centres, courtyards, warehouses and bicycle cellars, i.e. practically everywhere where they are usually stored.
As in previous years, most of the individual bicycle models are stolen Jopoja.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take the bike for short-term personal use, for example, but a large number of stolen bikes end up on sale, for example, online.
They remain in the domestic market.
"At least the police have not been informed that the stolen bikes are going abroad very much," Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
Some people buy a stolen bike without even knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of a used bike must be careful, as he or she may be guilty of a hide-and-seek offence or misdemeanor.
"The alarm bells should be ringing if a good-looking bike is sold at a price well below that," Reen says.
Special library clerk Severi Hirvi carries his colourful Nopsa to the Kallio Library in Helsinki for the duration of his working day.
He has had five wheels, but not one has been stolen, says Elk. "Never been taken, there has been a good monk."
"Perhaps this doesn't attract thieves so much, there's not necessarily any hipster value in this either," the Helsinki-based Hirvi ponders.
Siiri Valve, who quickly visited a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked her bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now the bike was hanging up against the wall, but usually Valve locks the bike to something fixed, such as a bike rack.
"It's a lot to think about, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," says a student from Helsinki about his white bike, the frame of which alone cost about five hundred euros.
"You hear from your friends all the time that the bikes have been stolen."
"Mostly bad bikes, those kind of snot-nosed joggers."
A bicycle was stolen from the inner yard of a housing company a year ago.
The bike had been left unlocked, so Valve expected it to be stolen.
Children under the age of 15 are responsible for their crimes.
Helsinki to test out U.S.-familiar jurors
In Helsinki, a so-called peer jury is being tested to prevent young people from being caught in a criminal cycle.
Initially, the experiment will apply to children under the age of 15, who are now left without criminal responsibility.
The peer jury intervenes in the first crime committed by a young person.
The idea is that the peer jury will discuss the incident with the offender and impose a sanction.
A week later, the offender can join the peer jury to make amends.
Other consequences may include a letter to the family explaining what has been done and what lessons have been learned.
The head of the youth department, Tommi Laitio, says that the model is not strict.
We have other models of mediation that are used in parallel.
“Everyone steers the young person’s activities in a more responsible direction so that everything would not be ruined by the first mistake,” Laitio says.
The peer jury has been modelled on the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after their first crime a young person is not in front of an adult panel, but reflects on what happened with people around the same age.
The model was tried once.
Iikka Lovio, a service designer at Palmu, who followed the experiment, says that it was an assault that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first offences committed by persons under 15 years of age may not have been dealt with at all before.
“It’s been a message to continue down the path you’ve chosen,” Lovio says.
The peer jury is part of the Immigrant Youth Helsinki project, which is supported by the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new ways of working are offered to all those in need, not just to young immigrants.
More Than 70 Republican Leaders Want the Party to Stop Funding Trump’s Campaign
More than 70 powerful Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the U.S. newspaper Politico, which had received a draft to see.
The letter is addressed to Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party’s money to be diverted from Trump’s campaign to Congressional elections.
“We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, along with his recklessness, incompetence, and record-breaking disapproval, threaten to bring an avalanche of votes to the Democrats in this election,” the letter said.
Only directing all possible funds to Congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning with a Trump-adorned anchor around their necks.
The letter said the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election are diminishing day by day.
Politico says the letter is due to be sent next week.
The signatories include politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organizers of the letter is prominently anti-Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
Weinstein said the letter comes from “people who want the party to protect its majorities in Congress” and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several actions by Donald Trump that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
He is also said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton pledges relief to U.S. families
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton gave details of her economic policy on Thursday night.
I'm running for president so the U.S. economy can do well for everyone.
“Donald Trump is running for president so the economy can do well for him and his friends,” Clinton said.
At the heart of the Clinton plan is a massive, $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure — roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be financed partly by tax increases for the rich, partly by private money.
The construction programme is a handshake for the American workers who suffered as factories moved to low-wage countries.
Clinton called the program the largest investment in high-paying jobs since World War II.
We are a nation of builders, we must return to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to ease the situation for working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders when he stressed that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it has to pay the exit tax,” Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he once supported.
“As president, I will oppose any trade deal that works against workers or wages,” Clinton said.
According to speculation published in The Washington Post before Clinton’s speech, Clinton was going to criticize the economic program announced by Republican Donald Trump on Monday that it “only favors millionaires like this one.”
Trump’s proposed corporate tax cut has been dubbed a “Trump loophole.”
On Thursday, Clinton said she was the daughter of a small business owner.
He reminded the audience of the small business owners whose bills Trump has not paid, and the clothes that Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
“If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making his own products in America,” Clinton said.
These are Rio’s ratings: The Games haven’t glued Finns to the screens, but I’m interested in the mobile app
Usually sports competitions appear in television viewer statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
The Olympic Games in Rio have so far not reached huge numbers of spectators.
At one time, the games have glued 12 per cent of the population to the screens: 615,000 viewers watched the Tuesday evening swim on the Yle olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
By way of comparison, the European Athletics Championships one month ago attracted almost 800,000 viewers to TV2, and the European Football Championships well over a million.
The most interesting Olympic sports so far have been Sunday night cycling and the gymnastics that opened the fifth day of the competition, both of which reached almost half a million viewers on the Olympic channel at a time.
Yle’s sports director Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the attendance figures, and reminds that for the first time in Rio Olympics, the spectators will be divided into several different instruments.
In addition to television, Finns watch the Olympics from the Rio Arena.
We are pleased with the proportion of television viewers who actually choose the Olympic Games.
Even on the television side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem.
The Rio Olympic Games are the first sports competitions to which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When a broadcast is broadcast 24 hours a day and the total number of viewers is from 20,000 to 500,000, it is a good basis.
The number of spectators is lower than at the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio's broadcasts come from Finland at night.
Another reason for the feeble interest - if anyone thinks it is feeble - is surely the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken some surprise medal from the opening competition, the interest would have bounced up with it.
In addition, athletics is just beginning, as are other sports of interest to Finns: sailing and horseback riding.
According to Pokkinen, the number of spectators at the beginning has been close to what was expected.
When athletics starts, the ratings explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the Games, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland in the first days of the Games in the Apple App Store.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I’d say we’re now at around 200,000.
"We'll get the online ratings later," Pokkinen says.
Rio Arena has not worked as expected for all users.
Pokkinen says that feedback has been received and faults have been corrected.
The use of the Rio Arena has been accompanied by delays and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
Updated versions of the applications have been received, which should correct the errors.
The Olympic Games in Rio can be seen on Yle’s canals and in the arena more than any other sporting event ever.
You can watch some sports on the Yle Fem channel, and Yle Puhe broadcasts games on the radio every day.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborious for Yle ever, but also the last, which can only be followed from Yle’s channels.
From 2018, Olympic sports will be shown on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, which is 95.3 metres deep in Riistinselkä.
It may be even deeper.
Technical dive instructor Matti Kannela found a depression of about 20 square meters in Ristiselkä, the depth of which the dive computer showed to be 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Institute tried in vain to confirm the observation by sonar scanning.
The method may not find a small recess in a hundred metres,” says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes include Lake Inari (92 metres) and Suvasvesi (90 metres).
Lake Saimaa, Lake Toisvesi and Lake Pääjärvi reach over 80 metres.
They haven't been studied as closely as the Päijänne.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been surveyed.
"There could very well be unknown depths there," Kannela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by the mean depth, it is Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
Viewed in this way, Päijänne does not make it to the top ten and Suvasvesi is even further away from the top.
Correction 12 August at 2:29 p.m.: Last paragraph corrected, where the deepest lakes at the mean depth were wrong.
Ihalainen on tax ale: Pensioner taxation still tighter
Pensioners are still taxed more heavily than wage earners.
Ihalainen says that the grievance came to light before the parliamentary elections, and the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to that of wage-earners.
The government’s proposal does not include this.
We think it should definitely be there.
The promises made should be kept after the elections, he tells Lännen Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received labour income deductions that reduced taxation.
The case heated up opposition MPs in Parliament, who scolded then-Finance Minister Alexander Stubb (ECR) for his election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
According to Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo, Ihalainen’s policy on tax cuts is mainly about safeguarding purchasing power, not increasing it, because next year wages will not be increased.
He says that the tax cut will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people’s uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with the messages from Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party) and Orpo, who want to honour the competitiveness agreement that has been achieved with great effort.
He says that keeping the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy measure of the government term.
It has been done by the labour market organisations, so it should not be ruined by questioning.
It comes in handy because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people’s own belief in the future.
Long-term unemployment must be tackled at the grassroots level
Ihalainen calls on the government to tackle long-term unemployment in the budget session, at least to stop its growth.
The number of long-term unemployed was around 17,000 higher in June than a year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government’s goal of raising the employment rate to 72% will be dashed.
He warns that if the challenge of long-term unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social bill.
Ambassador: No Finnish victims are known in the attacks in Thailand
At least four people were killed in the bombings in Thailand last night and last night.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to pay attention and avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists planning to visit Thailand should not cancel their trip due to the explosions, but the embassy’s instructions should be followed with caution, Westphalen says.
Very few people in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although it is difficult to estimate their exact number.
Finns travel to Thailand at the turn of the year.
The majority of tourists from Thailand come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Embassy of Finland has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach out especially to the Finns in Hua Hin to get information about the situation in the city.
However, many of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be going well, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
According to Westphalen, the perpetrator of the attacks has not yet been identified.
The ambassador speculates that the events may be related to the political unrest in Thailand’s divided society and last week’s referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who said they were against the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, there is an ethno-national conflict related to the Muslim population, Westphalen says.
Muslims want more self-determination.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today is a big, local holiday in Bangkok, Westphalen says.
She says the city celebrates the Queen’s birthday and Mother’s Day.
Traffic in the city is very limited.
The attacks are likely to affect the course of the day, so that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai police: Attacks are not about international terrorism
According to police, the attacks are “local sabotage” and are different from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been ruled out, Thai police said, according to the Associated Press.
At least four people have died in Thailand in the past 24 hours, with 11 bombs exploding across the country, including in tourist-friendly Phuket and Hua Hin.
Four bombs exploded in Phuket, a popular tourist destination for Finnish tourists, according to the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current information, there were no fatalities.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, injuring one person, according to the newspaper.
In Hua Hin, a popular tourist destination, four bombs were detonated yesterday and today, according to local authorities.
At least one person was killed in both double-bomb attacks.
In addition, at least one bomb went off in the village of Surat Thani and in the town of Trang in southern Thailand.
At least one person was killed in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it takes you to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The perpetrator of the attack is unknown
Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of Thailand’s ruling military junta, said the perpetrator of the attacks was not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
“We should not incite people to panic any more,” he told reporters.
Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan said that at least the Hua Hin and Trang attacks are linked.
He told the Thai BSB that the perpetrators had aimed to destroy the country’s tourism because all the attacks had taken place in tourist areas.
The Embassy of Finland urges Finns in the country to pay attention and avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns planning to travel to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to the explosions, but the Embassy’s instructions on caution should be followed, says Westphalen.
Injured Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks that took place during the Finnish night and their victims.
A little more information about last night's attack in Hua Hin.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
The injured include at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were injured in the second Hua Hin attack.
Two bombs exploded near a bell tower known as an attraction.
Thai PBS says police have sealed off an area in Hua Hin where it believes it has found another bomb.
Surat Thani's bomb was hidden in a flower bed, according to the governor of the province.
A municipal worker was killed in the attack.
At least one injured.
A police chief told CNN that two bombs were also used in the Surat Thani attack, which exploded about every half hour.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles wins women's quadruple scrimmage
Alexandra Raisman of the United States finished second with 60,098 points and Aliyah Mustafina of Russia third with 58,665 points.
Biles, 18, is still aiming for the scaffolding championships at the Rio Games with floor, jump and boom.
Biles has dominated women’s gymnastics in recent years.
He has won eight personal world championships.
He has won the four-match and floorball championships three times in a row, and the boom last year and the year before.
In the United States, Biles has won two World Team Championships.
Biles has the faintest World Cup medals in jumps and booms.
Finnish entrepreneur in Thailand: "Isku has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand, and a children’s play club in the same property, is not worried about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I don’t think there will be any more surprises,” says Huovila, who has worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen up close many of the tragedies that have affected Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then there was bird flu, and last year there was a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these haven’t driven away the tourists before, this probably hasn’t either.
The company’s office is located a few hundred metres from the site of the explosion.
Huovila heard about the attack from his own employee.
An employee called around 9:00 a.m. local time and said it's not a good idea to come to the office.
Huovila says that both the embankment and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed in the early morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought it was because of the Queen’s birthday,” Huovila said, referring to Friday’s holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and shops on the main street were allowed to open at around 10 a.m. local time.
Many on the beach had never heard of the attack.
By 2:30 a.m., the traffic in Patong had normalized, and most of the shops had opened.
Based on the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, Huovila says.
The car was later seen on the Jouxholmintie road in Kruunupyy.
When police arrived, the car was set on fire.
The patrol spotted two men matching the description, hiding in a nearby spruce forest.
The other man was caught immediately.
One escaped, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected of theft, theft and aggravated damage to a motor vehicle.
Police thank those who tipped them off.
Research Director on Russia’s leadership changes: Clear redeployment
Russia on Friday made its highest-ranking leadership change in years when President Vladimir Putin fired his head of government Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov’s successor is 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He is an ex-diplomat and served as Ivanov's second-in-command.
Kangaspuro says the reason for Ivanov’s dismissal may be Putin’s desire to prevent strong people around him from accumulating too much power.
He adds that the rotation of leadership positions is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from accumulating power independent of the President.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has gotten into trouble with other leaders or screwed up.
Drop-off for Ivanov
Ivanov, who was part of Putin’s inner circle, will take on special duties in the fields of environment and transport.
In a video broadcast by state media, Putin said the change would be a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other positions and proposed to replace him, Russia Today said.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov’s point of view, this is a clear loss of position.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high on the agenda in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most prominent people at the peak of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the Presidential Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, for example, governors, have been replaced in Russia recently.
Katri Pynn<0xC3><0xB6>niemi, a senior researcher at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, says that it is more interesting than the heir to Ivanov’s place that Putin changes his inner circle to be younger.
ISIS militants use civilians as human shield in Syria retreat
They used civilians as human shields to flee to the city of Jarabulus so we wouldn’t target them,” said Sherfan Darwish, a spokesman for the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters captured about 90 percent of the city of Manbij, which is important to ISIS.
Dozens of jihadists remained in the city.
Corrected earlier news at 7:30 p.m.: Earlier, we erroneously reported that civilians were fleeing the city, in fact, civilians were abducted by ISIS fighters while fleeing the city.
Professor: Ministry of the Interior's document disclosure policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior’s policy on public access to documents is unlawful, says Professor of Public Law Tomi Voutilainen from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells STT that public access to documents cannot be based on the authority’s own policies, but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants to Ilta-Sanomat.
The Minister justified the decision on the basis of instructions from the Prime Minister’s Office and on the grounds that the information had been recorded in the Minister’s calendar and not in accounting material.
The Ministry’s Director of Communications tells STT that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's final Olympic show begins in Rio
As in previous years, Bolt has been running against the clock.
He injured his hind legs early in the season and was forced to miss the Jamaican Olympic qualifiers.
This hasn't been perfect preparation, but I'm in much better shape.
“I’ve trained well and that’s the key thing,” Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
That press conference included scantily clad samba dancers and fan-turned-journalists.
Around Porina Bolt, it is underlined that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when athletics has struggled with doping scandals and falling interest.
Bolt's last defeat at the 2004 Olympics was in Athens, where he was eliminated in the 200-meter preliminaries with a time of 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise held back by injuries and a loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, he began his reign at the 100-meter mark, breaking the world record and the confidence of his rivals with a time of 9.69.
This is more difficult
A year later at the World Championships in Berlin, Bolt reached the pinnacle of his career.
The Berlin world records of 9.58 meters and 19.19 for 200 meters are still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a world record of 200 meters and 19 seconds, but no one but Bolt believes that it will happen.
Bolt’s biggest challenger is Athens 2004 Olympic 100 winner Justin Gatlin.
In the Beijing World Cup final last year, Bolt defeated the American by a mere one-hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has never lost in the World Cup finals, if only to make it to the top.
In Daegu 2011, Bolt missed the 100m final due to a bad start.
Bolt turns 30 in just over a week.
He is an old man in the young men’s sport, and the Rio Games will be his last Olympics.
Bolt has set next year’s World Cup in London as the final finish line of his career.
These are the Olympics that set me apart.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But whenever I’m down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Rio: Two Athletes Suspected of Doping
According to the Chinese state news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi found traces of banned substances in a doping test.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan athletics coach was sent to my home because he gave a doping test on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping test showing signs of the hormone epo.
She finished fourth in the women's 100m butterfly in Rio.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has taken his doping case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).
Xinhua said a sample of Xinyi's body on Sunday showed signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
There are also other allegations of doping in Rio.
Bulgarian female runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping test showing signs of the hormone epo.
Kenya has sent home an athletics coach from Rio for doping offences.
The International Olympic Committee said on Thursday that the Kenyan coach had posed as an athlete in a test situation and had given a doping test on his behalf.
According to media reports, this is Kenyan sprint coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used a race pass from the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotichi.
Phelps is unstoppable - historic gold became a showpiece
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swam in the 200-meter medley in his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps became the first swimmer to achieve Olympic gold in the same sport in the fourth consecutive Games.
Phelps had a winning time of 1.54.66.
Kosuke Hagino of Japan finished second before Wang Shun of China.
“I’m just trying to have a little fun,” Helen Skelton, the BBC’s Olympic swimming commentator, laughs in an instant interview with Iltalehti.
The story about Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read on this week’s Iltalehti website.
Commentary by Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn’t get a lot of stress if there’s a little noise in social media or the British press about his revealing and special outfits.
Television is a visual medium, he says.
Skelton is dressed in high-heeled shoes and a short dress that is sure to have at least enough exposure - at least to the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
However, there are no backward steps.
It’s important to look good, and small judgments are just a fun thing to do.
Skelton wants to impress, perhaps even startle, but he insists that he does not want to be in the lead role.
This is not about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus has to be on the athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the controversy has reached as far as Finland?
“I can’t, but anything that focuses on how hard these swimmers work and how much they sacrifice is okay with me,” Skelton said.
You know what, man?
It's a hassle from nowhere if it comes from (the host's) clothing.
I'm a little amused if someone's been hit by one of these.
Rio police make two arrests over suspected terrorist attack
Rio police said on Thursday that they had arrested two people on suspicion of terrorism.
The police made the arrests in connection with security surveillance of the Games.
At the same time, police made five more arrests and interrogated two people before they were released.
All the suspects were Brazilians.
According to the G1 news website, those arrested for terrorism belong to the same group whose members were already arrested by police in July.
The suspects are believed to have ties to the Islamic State group.
The detainees were known to incite violence on social media.
The calls for violence had been circulated, among other things, on the popular WhatsApp service.
At the Rio Games, 85,000 police officers are responsible for safety.
Police detonate suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria were forced to start their first round of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
The police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed it to the public.
The police let the public in after detonating the package in a controlled manner.
This is the third time during the Rio Olympics that police have carried out a controlled detonation mission.
The police closed the arena because of a suspicious package found there.
The public got in after the police had controlledly detonated the package.
The audience could not get to the auditorium by the start of the match because the police closed the arena for a while due to a suspicious package found in the hall.
The police detonated the package and let the public into the hall only after that.
The drink woke up the Spanish team, who started the games sleepily.
Spain, who started the race with two losses, won Nigeria 96-87.
In the last two races, Spain won the silver medal.
The police carried out a controlled blasting mission for the third time during the Rio Games.
The last time police had to blow up a suspicious discovery near a road cycling destination was last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started the Rio Basketball Cup in front of empty stands.
An Argentine lady pounced on Petäjä-Siren - a Finn pondered the protest
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
Wind Petäjä-Siren went through a rough patch on Thursday.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren was greeted by an Argentine lady in Rio on Thursday at the opening of the women’s surfing day.
The wind was clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the violation.
He got stuck because of the accident, and the others ran away,” Finland’s head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
The athlete thought long and hard about protesting.
It was not worth it, because it would have been useless according to the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water to get a refund,” Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn hung on his board to the last because he didn’t want to get into Rio’s dirty water.
When the car crashed, the Finn came in 27th place.
Overall, the London 2012 Olympic silver medallist is the eighth.
With regard to the tip, the accident did not have much effect.
Friday is an important day for the race from 10-12.
Edited 0.39: Contrary to the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not make a protest.
7 Strange Things That Science Says Will Lengthen Your Life
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to add years to a person’s life.
Some things are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health so that his life lengthens.
On the other hand, sometimes things that a person cannot control themselves can bring him extra years.
These include, for example, a tendency to obesity in the middle of the body or social status.
Regular shopping can extend your life.
You don't even have to spend money - just getting a milk carton is enough.
The secret of long life has been discovered in many studies.
Medical Daily reported on seven of the strangest findings.
According to science, all of these things can add years to your life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Drinking coffee has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.
A study by Harvard University found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a “reduced risk of death,” especially in the case of neurological or cardiovascular diseases.
Studies have shown that moderate consumption – one to three servings a day – can prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular flossing can extend a person’s life by up to six years, according to one study.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
This can lead to other diseases in the rest of the body.
A study conducted in Norway found out how laughter affected a person’s life span.
The seven-year project monitored more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be alive at the end of the study.
Sex, when it comes to protection against sexually transmitted diseases, is good for health, according to many studies.
In addition, it can also prolong life.
Unfortunately, just having sex is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years of life, he must also have an orgasm.
Of course, mobility will add years, there is no denying that.
However, reaching a long life does not require absolute gracefulness.
A University of Oxford study found that women with large buttocks had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega-3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality.
Whether you’re an Olympic medallist or an Oscar-winning actor, you’re more likely to live longer than a regular bun.
Many studies have tried to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that adds years to his or her life.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that a long life is due to a person's social status - which, for its part, makes it possible to seek recognition such as the Nobel Prize, for example.
A study of the shopping behaviour of people over 65 years of age found that a person who shopped daily was likely to be a parent who shopped less often.
This is due to the fact that spinning in concrete shops reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may precipitate death.
So put your credit card down - online shopping will therefore not have the same effect.
Drunk driver crashes into truck after crashing
On Friday evening, a serious head-on collision between a truck and a passenger car took place in Koske, Southwest Finland.
The accident took place in Koske, halfway between Koskentie and Sorvastontie, on Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the car that had come to meet it had drifted into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
The truck was left in its lane after the crash, but caught fire.
The driver managed to put out the fire himself.
The car crashed into a ditch and then over the ditch onto its roof.
A woman who was born in 1972 was trapped in her car.
The rescue service removed the injured driver from the car and he was transported to the Turku University Central Hospital for treatment.
Her breath test result was 2.02 per mil.
He is suspected of aggravated drunk driving.
Postcards sent to the wrong city
There were shortcomings in Salon K-Citymarket’s bulk candy selection, because the post office had delivered some of the cargo to Seinäjoki by accident.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perni<0xC3><0xB6>, was shopping for candies at Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when she saw a funny sign.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in loose confectionery, because Posti delivered our cargo to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when Posti gets the delivery!
So unless you're busy mowing the lawn, the sign said.
The merchant’s sign is related to the fact that last spring Posti expanded its services to include grass cutting.
Grass cutting will be available at Posti until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing and decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update surprised me.
Representatives of the media have also been calling all the time, and the attention raised by this issue is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia’s update had over 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia got her own favorites in a bag of loose candy, even though a few boxes were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who is responsible for the business operations of Posti’s Corporate Transport Services, apologised for the damage to Ilta-Sanomat.
The background is that three of the five stages strayed to the wrong place yesterday (Seinäjoki) and we didn't go to make a partial delivery (Saloo) with three, but took five stages only today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanomat.
This was first reported in the evening.
Teija Halti was not upset by the sign, because she found all her own candy favourites from the selection.
30 kg lighter Lotta Backlund published a photo of her change
The comedian-producer has lost dozens of pounds since the birth of her baby.
Lotta Backlund has lost dozens of pounds as a result of the change in her life.
Lotta shared a couple of photos of her change on Instagram on Friday.
In the spring, Lotta was on a fitness course and aimed for a normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014
Comedian and TV producer Lotta Backlund started her weight loss project already in 2009.
She has undergone a comprehensive lifestyle change and gradually lost about thirty kilograms.
On Friday, Backlund posted a pair of photos of her stunning performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed over the years.
Backlund’s Before and After photo pair has gathered many compliments from fellow dieters.
You're gorgeous.
We’re on the same journey, motivation is hard!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Let's Do It Now project.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures when I’m on my way,” says another.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last kilos while working on the Let's Do It Now project.
At the time, he told Iltalehti that he wanted to finally reach a normal weight, which at that time was ten kilograms.
Over the course of three months, five kilos were lost.
The family of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Commemorations of the victim for the benefit of police dogs
The family of a 42-year-old woman murdered a week ago in Loviisa hopes that the victim will be remembered not with flowers and petitions, but with a donation for police dog work.
Sipoo Veterinary Centre has published a Facebook post in which it conveys the wishes of the victim’s family for donations for the benefit of police dogs.
The publication says that the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipoo Veterinary Station and had also completed her nurse training there.
The veterinary clinic remembers the woman with words that touch her.
Happy, smart, humorous and fearless.
My good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that all donations go to police dogs, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old woman from Loviisa was murdered in her own home yard in Loviisa, Koskenkylä.
The woman’s neighbors told the newspaper that the victim was very fond of animals.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens, and a rooster.
The 27-year-old man did not know the woman and had no connection with her.
Police dog B<0xC3><0xB6>rje was involved in the tracking of the killer, who was fatally wounded in the arrest.
B<0xC3><0xB6>rje, however, survived and is recovering.
The District Court issued a judgment against Posti for violation of the Non-Discrimination Act
Posti was not entitled to withhold the salary of an employee who refused to provide orientation for a temporary agency worker, the Kanta-Häme district court assessed in its judgment.
The district court ordered Posti to pay the employee most of the wages withheld and EUR 2,000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only a part of the instructor’s salary that corresponded to the part of the induction work during the whole day.
According to the District Court, contrary to the Non-Discrimination Act, an employee was placed in a less favourable position on the basis of trade union activities.
The employee had complied with PAU’s organisational decision on the ban on orientation.
During the postal strike in November last year, PAU made a decision according to which Posti’s employees do not familiarise rental workers who violate the strike.
This was first reported in the People's News.
Turkey must return to a path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic development that respects human rights, Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (Centre Party) wrote in their response to the Federation of Journalists.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party) and Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (PS) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
The Union of Journalists has previously asked Sipilä and Soini to express their concern for freedom of speech and freedom of the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland has repeatedly highlighted to Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and freedom of speech.
Putin sacks head of administration, replaced by Estonian-born Persecution
Russian President Vladimir Putin has sacked the head of the Russian presidential administration, Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin said.
It will be replaced by Anton Vaino, grandson of Soviet Estonian Communist leader Karl Vaino.
Vaino is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as the deputy head of the presidential administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, the Interfax news agency reports.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his government.
According to a Kremlin statement, Ivanov, who was a close member of Putin’s inner circle, will take on special tasks related to the environment and transport.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other positions and proposed to replace him, Russia Today reports.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era on spying for the KGB.
Ivanov was seen by many as a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed to the post in 2011, ahead of Putin’s re-election in 2012.
BBC: ManU's massive acquisition of a ban - will not be seen in Premier League opening
The world record for football transfers will not be seen on the pitch when the Premier League kicks off this weekend.
Paul Pogba was banned from playing in England.
Manchester United's Paul Pogba has been suspended from playing for Manchester United as the club opens its season against Bournemouth on Sunday, the BBC said on Friday.
ManU paid Juventus €105 million for Pogba, according to British media.
However, the FA keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was suspended from Juventus.
He received two warnings last season in the Italian Cup and will be suspended for one game.
That ban has been moved to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next match will be in the League's second round on 19 August, when ManU will face Southampton.
In Flow, megalomania is a virtue
Precise criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established Flow Festival’s status as an internationally acclaimed event starring the world’s top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festivalgoers have typically expressed themselves in distinctive dress.
One of the main stage artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
Flow Festival’s event area is styled with artificial turf and art installations.
It has never been enough for us to have only a main stage and a beer tent, says the artistic director of the event Tuomas Kallio.
Flow Festival, held in Suvilahti, Helsinki this weekend, has grown from a small block festival to an event for tens of thousands of visitors.
Behind the success lies a simple question: What kind of event would the authors themselves like to go to?
It is quite different in event productions to think this way.
Often, the goal is to reach the level of necessity and act in accordance with official regulations, says the artistic director of the event Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was going to sell out again this year.
The goal was to increase the number of visitors by 5,000 last year’s 70,000 people.
This year, the festival hosts a number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists.
An increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because the activities must be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle guided by huge avenues.
We don't want that.
For 13 years, the ideology of the successful event has been inflated to include 130 performers, art installations, numerous restaurant points and drink bars in the area, partly decorated with artificial grass.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stages, this year there will be a tent for 15,000 people.
I agree that the event could be done more simply.
Maybe I'm a little megalomaniac, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve Flow's spirit.
If you lose it, this isn't our thing anymore.
For Kallio, the greatest joy and reward for the work done is that nowadays even great visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event, in the mid-2000s, operations were highly dependent on the City of Helsinki’s support of approximately EUR 20,000.
Last year, the turnover of the limited liability company operating Flow was approximately EUR 6 million.
It can be used to produce “crazy things,” such as the construction of that 73-meter-wide tent.
Flow’s visitors have typically expressed themselves with a distinctive dress code.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about a trendy community of young adults.
The event, however, has not been consciously profiled as particularly fashionable.
Above all, we want to stand out with content.
Yet, fashion also fits Flow’s values: curiosity and a desire to interact with the environment,” says Kallio.
This year, one of the artists on the main stage is the legend of punk, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
He has a huge fan base in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer at a festival that combines indie rock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time this will be seen at a gig in Finland.
We're interested in everything, history and the future.
It's not just what's on the commercial radio.
Iggy’s latest album is damn good and she’s done damn good gigs in the last few years.
Thailand’s tourist parade bombs were hidden in flower pots – tourists fled in terror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flowerpot and detonated using mobile phones.
The bombs were placed on a street where most of the customers are foreigners.
They were detonated at the same time as tourists began leaving the bars and returning to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumran told CNN.
Edwin Wiek, a wildlife protector who has lived in Asia since 1989, tweeted a telling image of the attacks.
If you can't see the tweet, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of the injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran up to me and said that a bomb had gone off at the bars.
It happened on one of the biggest bar streets, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of injured is not yet known.
Shortly after that, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, which was also popular among the Finns.
As far as we know, no one died.
A second double bomb attack was also carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one person was killed and three were injured.
In addition, one bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police said they had found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely to be insurgents behind the bombings, who are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently seized on the activities of criminal organisations that traffic in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new readiness forces will first go into battle in a war situation
In an acute war situation, conscripts are ordered to combat only after several months of taking the military oath, says Keskisuomalainen.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, the Chief of Training of the Finnish Defence Forces, who was interviewed by the newspaper, only those conscripts who are in the final stages of their training are eligible for combat if they serve for 5.5 months in a war situation.
According to the Head of Training, reserve members of the response forces are first recruited.
No conscript or reservist is ordered to perform a task that has not been given the required training, Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Finnish Defence Forces will begin training conscripts in immediate readiness units from next year.
If necessary, units can be used in military operations already during conscript training.
Pamela Tola received huge compensation from the mould house
Actress Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a major dispute over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of the two-storey detached house had been EUR 330,000.
After the sale, however, a serious moisture problem was discovered in the house, which caused a microbial growth that was dangerous to health.
The couple had to sell their home in 2014.
The sale price had fallen to EUR 132,000, which resulted in a financial loss of no less than EUR 198,000 for Tola and Waroma.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the district court and the court of appeal.
The court handed down its judgment on Wednesday.
It upheld the judgment of the district court ordering the seller to pay a price reduction of EUR 150 000 to Tola and Waroma.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 344 in court and settlement costs.
The right to a reasonable price reduction slightly because the buyers had been aware of the need to repair the apartment already at the time of the sale.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the construction defects that had appeared were substantially more serious than had been presented.
Tola was looking for a good home
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically been looking for a home in good condition because they did not want to undertake repair work.
He had the impression that the building had been renovated and in good condition, and that there was no harm in the matters mentioned in the condition inspection report.
The condition inspection report mentioned the risks and shortcomings of ventilation and the fact that the management of rain and melting water flowing along the rock surface is not sufficient.
However, the discussions did not indicate that there was any urgency.
Tola and Waroma were left with the idea that the rainwater coming from the rock should perhaps be controlled a little in a few years.
The transaction was completed in October 2009.
Within a few years, it turned out that the moisture problems in the apartment were much more serious than expected.
Inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 revealed microbial growth in the building, which, according to witnesses, were caused by both the rainwater in the rock and the capillary increase in soil moisture.
According to the inspector’s assessment, air contaminated by microbes on the west side of the house could also enter the interior through the porch.
Mould or yeast that exceeded the limit values and enabled a health risk were found in the laundry room, basement staircase, living room window heater and basement washroom.
Terraces were built without permits
The court also questioned whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The court found that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo to make changes to the apartment contrary to the permit before the transaction.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, although there were no proper permits yet.
However, mold problems were a central issue in court.
According to the Court of Appeal, buyers could, on the basis of the information they had received from the seller before the sale, assume that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no immediate need for major repairs.
In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, Tola and Waroma had no particular reason to carry out a more extensive inspection than usual.
Buyers have not failed to comply with their obligation to provide information, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children to Nazis – including Finns in the register
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in a recent Dagens Nyheter article that the U.S. National Archives in Maryland has microfilmed documents about a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also American, French, Dutch and Russian women.
At least 65 Danes, 86 Norwegians and 14 Finns as well as 31 Swedish women wanted to be a Nazi bride.
The documents and registration cards are from a breed agency in Nazi Germany.
The Office was under the command of SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he was examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true even more so for women who had to be able to bear more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were subjected to gynecological examinations to investigate the matter.
The Office investigated women’s backgrounds, for example, by examining church records.
The purpose was to make sure that there were no Jews in the women's pedigree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and hand over handwritten biographies and good recommendations from loved ones to the breed bureau.
The Office wanted guarantees that women were "child-loving," "sparing," and "good National Socialists" who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as brides for SS men.
The story does not say what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
The SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that every SS man should have four children, whether married or not.
Lebensborn homes look after children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not actively promoted, according to the website of the American Holocaust Museum.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on the family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by offering loans and supported the birth of children.
The German Mother’s Cross of Honor was awarded to women who had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum said.
Petäjä-Siren sixth, Nirkko got up and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third in the first start of the Finnjolls’ day at the Rio Olympics, but he was left with the best of luck at the second start of the day.
Weird finished eighth after five starts, but the failure of the second put him in 14th place.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren fought 17th and 3rd places in the RS:X class day.
In total, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In the 470 class Joonas and Niklas Lindgren were 23rd in the opening race of the day.
The Lindgrens are ranked 19th overall.
Jari Sillanpää's Satulinna was recorded with a couple of hours of sleep: "I was so hungover"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of Finland’s favourite artists for over 20 years.
Sillanpää, the bartender of the cruise ship, became the Tango King of 1995, Finland’s best-selling solo artist, and the star of dance stages and festivals, is still on the rise.
The book Jari Sillanpää - Paljaana, written by Mari Koppinen and about the life of the favourite singer, was published today on Thursday.
In the book, Sillanpää talks about his life and career in both good and bad.
Sillanpää’s career took off when he won the Tango King’s crown at the Seinäjoki Tango Market in 1995.
Sillanpää sang tangos in the competition, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango piece for Sillanpää at his request, which Kassu Halonen arranged in a slightly different form.
Satulinna became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so hungover!
The bridge reminds me of the book.
From the recording of the song, which has become a huge hit, one would not immediately guess that it was sung in a hangover.
Even though I wasn’t physically at my best, the track was still good.
I learned that you don’t always have to demand perfection and excellence from yourself.
Another incident involving the man’s most popular songs, described in the book, occurred nearly twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his then-partner and the case eventually ended with the lyrics of the song “You deserve gold”, which was released as a single in 2014.
According to the book, the lyrics ordered from Saara T<0xC3><0xB6>rmänen were not what Sillanpää would have wanted.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making an album that would tell a true story about his life, but the words to the song about the divorce were not true, but it was written based on the news of the 7 Days magazine.
In the newspaper’s news, the reason for Jari’s and his ex-lover’s breakup was excessive partying and alcohol consumption, but Jari said it was complete nonsense and not true.
According to the book, Jari called the record company in a rage and refused to sing the song, but ended up singing it anyway - and that's fine.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters were in favour of leaving and 48% would have stayed in the Union, even though polls during voting week predicted the opposite.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in their support of remaining in the EU.
Not a single respected research institute or university flagged for the difference, even though a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The slogan of former US President Bill Clinton’s recent election campaign, “It’s the economy, stupid,” was thrown into the dustbin by Britain’s Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Curly language (economics)
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics asks the industry for answers to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economists were not listened to, because this time the voters made the decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation for the loss of economic status among economists is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the illusion that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in employment, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's for the real Brit.
Many also have the impression that a fall in the value of a currency would be a good thing, because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the economists, the voters did not believe the economic arguments, because the consensus of economists did not come out sufficiently.
They were particularly struck by the BBC's neutrality, which gave as much room to economists who were in favour of leaving the EU as to the overwhelming majority, representing only a few per cent of the economy.
The EU-hostile press was not interested in telling what the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other capital combinations of the economy thought about the consequences of the separation.
Those distant letter combinations spoke facelessly about economic growth, trade relations, sovereign debt, and currency.
And if the economists’ messages were both listened to and understood, they were ignored because economists represent an elite with whom, in their opinion, the voters do not share common interests.
Academics in big cities, such as economists, would have remained in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas, the message was not effective.
Immigration is an economy.
The overwhelming argument for victory in the Brexit vote was immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant congests your hospital, an immigrant takes advantage of you.
These arguments work.
There are foreign workers in every cafe.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
You can see immigrants in the waiting room of every health centre.
How much easier would it be to get a doctor's appointment if it weren't for them?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for real British children to get a place in school if they got rid of them?
Foreigners live in every municipality.
How much more space would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
Economists, however, failed to respond and, if they did, their answers were not given any visibility.
Economists failed to explain that thanks to immigrants, Britons have more jobs, fewer waiting lists, and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and EU migrants in particular - are net contributors to Britain's public finances and their spending creates jobs.
Aberdeen real estate fund prepared for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Pertti Vanhanen from Finland.
In Aberdeen, he said, preparations for Brexit were made in good time by drawing up plans A and B.
A few weeks before the vote, more detailed preparations were made for Plan B, the victory of the camp in favour of leaving the EU, in case the result would be a leave.
The concern was that investors would begin to withdraw their funds from the market.
Real estate funds do not normally have large amounts of liquid assets, but they could be needed now.
We started to raise cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd, we had 25 percent of the fund’s investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says of Aberdeen’s only open daily-quoted real estate fund that was covered by the news.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20 percent.
The fund was worth <0xC2><0xA3>3.5 billion at the time.
The total value of the company’s funds is approximately <0xC2><0xA3>20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open-ended real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all open-ended real estate funds in the UK.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained at 10% or even below.
Real estate funds prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
The funds shut down trading.
When the pro-divorce camp won, Europe went awry.
However, the two weeks that followed the voting in the real estate market were quite calm, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first real estate fund, Standard Life, froze its trading.
Together, they brought the situation to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
Snowball began to spin, and one fund after another had to close its doors.
Aberdeen was in a good position due to the cash raised, but was also forced to freeze its trade for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close the trade, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether they should now pull the money out in a panic.
Aberdeen’s message was that if you are not forced to take your money out now, it is not worth it, as it would result in losses.
It calmed things down, and most of them withdrew the notification.
Since then, it has been fairly steady, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, Vanhanen says.
He points out that, for example, there has been no similar upheaval in Aberdeen’s continental European funds.
However, there were a lot of questions.
Unnecessary attention to real estate funds
According to Vanhanen, the closures of real estate funds received undue attention.
The open-ended funds affected by the closures control around four per cent of UK property.
The Aberdeen lockdown lasted six days and the company sold less than ten of its 80 properties in London.
Other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned investors this week that it might keep its fund closed for 2017.
At the moment there is uncertainty in the air and economic growth forecasts have been slashed, but the situation does not look "more timid" from Aberdeen's point of view.
The main questions now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities for some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The pound-dollar exchange rate is at its lowest level in 30 years, and there is a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30 percent cheaper.
There are a lot of willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit brings downsides to London real estate market
At two in the morning, the situation did not look very good.
But at four o’clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, who is in charge of real estate investments at the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the word for it.
I realized that this now goes to Plan B,” Vanhanen says in his second home in Helsinki.
He immediately went to work.
The City of London was already fully alive in the early hours of the morning.
TV screens, normally muted at the office, greeted the news, and usually the loud crowd was completely silent when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to announce his resignation.
When the market opened, the display terminals flashed only red.
It was the kind of morning you never thought you’d live,” Vanhanen says.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain’s largest real estate funds, finalized two real estate deals the day after the Brexit vote.
The mood was confusing.
However, the company had prepared well for the alternative, which is why the situation was kind of calm,” Vanhanen says.
The Brexit vote has begun
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership went on exchange.
The market began to anticipate sharp declines in the UK real estate market, especially in London.
The London office space was projected to be down by up to 20 percent in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trading one after another.
Aberdeen did the same for six days.
Now the storm has subsided, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it doesn't show on the face of Vanhanen, who spent his last days of summer holiday in Helsinki this week.
It is far too early to say much about Brexit.
So much remains to be done: how will the separation take place and how will Scotland react to the situation, for example.
Initial data on the development of the London property market have already been obtained.
The real estate services company CBRE’s data on price development covers about one third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
The City of London’s office buildings accounted for 6.1 per cent of the negative, Vanhanen says.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have been worse, Vanhanen says.
All of the same falls occurred in the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is also interesting because Brexit was quickly compared to Lehman’s downfall and the global economic crisis that began in the US real estate market.
Mr Vanhanen said that the comparison is not entirely accurate, as this is now a home-grown crisis in Britain.
The mood is different.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales like that at the time, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, Vanhanen says.
Funding is normally available.
The repair could have been done anyway.
In fact, a price correction is no surprise to him – it could have happened without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that real estate prices in London and other top cities in the world have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years now that City and especially the offices are overpriced,” Vanhanen says.
The fall started really high.
London prices have risen for four reasons, according to Vanhanen’s list.
The British economy has grown strongly, as has the population of London.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last ownership category that is globalizing, Vanhanen says.
New players from the Middle East and Asia have entered the market, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which have forced pension companies, for example, to look for returns on new assets.
On top of this, loans have been readily available - although, according to Vanhanen, the leverage has now been clearly less than during the pre-crisis boom of 2008.
Distribute, Distribute
In London, the rise in prices levelled off last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen also began to lighten its holdings in London, and last year was a net seller.
There was some kind of twist to be expected, and now it has come.
What's next?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhanen says.
Not much he dares to estimate, but he says that there is hardly any upswing.
The mood indicates that there is a downward or even trend ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen several moves up and down, as he has been in the real estate industry since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that you can work your way out of a hole.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in decentralization.
If you invest in one market, you are too much of a victim.
If it is decentralized, the risks are also decentralized, Vanhanen says.
S Group starts to register purchase data more accurately than before
Soon, S Group will know what you are eating, as the trading group announced today that it will begin to collect more detailed information on its regular customers’ purchases.
After collecting data on the total amount of the receipt so far, the group will start collecting it at the beginning of May also from the purchased products.
S Group will follow Kesko in this, as information on goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years already.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data is collected with the customer’s consent and used for marketing purposes subject to authorisation.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have banned the use of product information, says Riitala to Taloussanomat.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to the S Group's registration change.
Kesko already categorises its regular customers into ten groups based on food purchases alone.
The classification is updated monthly.
Loyalty customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for customer-oriented marketing.
Product-specific purchase data is collected only from K Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty programme and is not currently planning one.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own Ykk<0xC3><0xB6>sbonus loyalty programme, which can be joined at Valintatalo, Siwoi and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect product- or group-level information, we will keep to the total amount of the receipt.
That is, we know in which store the purchases were made and on what day and the total amount of the customer’s receipt.
We have not gone to that level like K Group or S Group,” says Commercial Director Anu Ora.
According to him, the loyalty programme will be renewed in the future, but Lähikauppa will tell about it later.
However, Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
Initially, the experiment
SOK’s co-op member and customer register has been relatively extensive so far.
In addition to personal data and address data, basic data have also included occupation, education, type of residence, and the years of birth and previous personal data of children.
People in the same household and their roles are also registered.
The S-Etukortti card purchase records the date and time of purchase, place, total amount of purchases and payment method.
In addition, the S-bonus partners’ information has been obtained from their cashier systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
In S-markets, Prisms, Kodin Terroi and ABC chains, however, the data are recorded at the product group level for the time being.
For some time now, customers have been hoping that marketing could be targeted more precisely, says Marjaana Saarikoski, SOK’s Head of Co-op and Partner Operations.
S Group says it will inform its customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific data for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored in the cash registers anyway, whether you like it or not.
You can check your stored data on the S Group website.
For example, cashiers do not have access to the data, Saarikoski emphasises.
Video: Heila-puppy is the newest dog confirmed by Customs - Puppy will be the first explosive dog
Black Labrador puppy sniffs vigorously five similar boxes lined up on the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It won’t be long before it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog for playing with his favourite toy.
In the box next to which Heila was sitting, a jar of cartridges reeking of gunpowder gas was discovered.
Gunpowder gas is the first smell that has been practised with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and e-commerce main reasons
Heila is Customs’ first dog specialising in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed at Helsinki Airport next year.
If necessary, work assignments may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossing points and ports.
However, the airport will be Heila’s main workplace, as the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused measures at Customs, and after the attacks, surveillance has been strengthened, says Mikko Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nberg, Senior Officer at Customs.
Another main reason for training a gun and explosive dog in Customs’ duties is postal deliveries via Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the increased internet sales, as many as 40 million postal items pass through the airport each year, which may include weapons and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made around 300 discoveries at Helsinki Airport related to weapons, weapons parts, ammunition and explosives and their precursors among online purchases, luggage of passenger aircraft and air freight.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It will examine checked baggage and mail.
In ports, it will be of great benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nberg.
Based on Heila’s performance, Customs will assess whether more weapon and explosive dogs will be trained in the future.
Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nberg is optimistic about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
Heila-puppy training is coordinated by Customs dog school in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio and Heila will also attend training sessions with the police and Defence Forces experts.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Finnish Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, will decide what smells Heila will be taught to recognise.
Heila is always further trained as needed, says Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nberg.
Heila’s colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Customs’ six drug dogs and the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador Retriever Heila has been selected from a litter of ten puppies.
The criteria for choosing a dog at the airport include cheerfulness and hunting instincts, as well as calmness, because the dog is involved with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives in Suntio’s home, is a close colleague of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can’t get anywhere at home without Heila, Suntio laughs.
Subtle orders go to Heila once and for all.
The cameraman of Ilta-Sanomat loses the mic cover of the camera to the fast dog, but Heila returns the mic cover, which looks like a soft toy, immediately after the "disconnect" command.
Tough competition for working dogs
Heila’s initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next in October, to assess whether the training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heila can be seen working at Helsinki Airport next year, if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers are not allowed to iron a dog wearing a work vest, Suntio reminds.
The cost of one working dog to Customs is approximately 60000-70000 euros per year.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire in the care of their owner.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active work sessions only last from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
Working dogs are in fierce competition at Customs.
About 20-30 Customs employees applied for ownership of Heila.
She was lucky to meet Suntio, who has never had a working dog before, but she has years of experience in dogs and surveillance duties at Customs.
Mini-state gets its first Olympic medal – people get a day off
With a population of less than one million, Fiji’s Olympic gold in rugby is so highly valued in the country that the government has designated 22 August as a national holiday.
The Fijian government confirmed the case after the championship was decided.
The day off is the day after the team returns home.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
The Fijian rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country watched the final in the capital Suva, where a screen had been set up for the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even the Chinese restaurants were watching the game, I heard them cheering, said Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru to the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - a Finnish buyer fainted after a wild performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola made his last attempt at 175 kilos after a hard fight.
Tokola is a special and life-threatening feature for a lifter.
During, or immediately after, severe withdrawals, he has fainted many times.
No one has really been able to say why.
Tokola gained 175 kilos from the push and 145 kilos from the rally in Rio.
His total score was 320 kilos.
Tokola tried to push 175 kilos last time, as did the other one.
On the third attempt, the weights rose accompanied by fierce roaring.
The body shook under the weights until the jury approved the lift.
The Finnish buyer’s joy was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquires Estonian forward Prosa - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
Rovaniemi Palloseura, who plays in the men’s football league, has signed an agreement with Estonian forward Albert Prosa that will last until the end of the season.
We are looking for a top player in our team who has power and whose threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
We went through over 50 players from all over the world with more than ten players agents.
Gradually, Prosa started to stand out as a good option,” RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flora, Tallinn, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 games.
He also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is scheduled to be with RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where Rovaniemi residents will meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new striker when last season’s land king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
Proud Modern Family Star Shrugs Again: Teen Star’s Shorts Reveal Almost Everything
Ariel Winter, who is known as Alex Dunphy from the Modern Family comedy series, once again shows off her voluptuous body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs, but also his buttocks.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and behavior to be much bolder.
She has posed for pictures on social media in very few clothes and has had numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very scanty outfits.
Winter, who is on the verge of adulthood, has also recently published several pictures of herself celebrating.
If you don't see it, you can watch it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his public image so radically.
Amy Palmer, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, suspected that Winter was undergoing a “typical Hollywood transformation” from child star to adult.
He has been on television his entire life and has grown up in the Kardashian era.
He’s learned that the more exposed the surface looks, the more publicity and attention Hollywood gets,” Palmer told Fox News, adding that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter first appeared in the Modern Family series at the age of 11.
The actor has angered some of his longtime fans with his image change.
It’s not hard to guess where she’ll be in ten years, when the downhill is already so hard, says one woman on Winter’s Instagram.
Some of her fans, on the other hand, defend the actress and urge her to ignore the criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what anyone says.
You are an inspiration to many women, says the young woman.
The Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted by the Northern Lights: In autumn, it is possible to see the fairytale-like mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to encourage the Japanese to start their aurora borealis journeys already in the early autumn, says Visit Finland.
The main destinations of the Japanese northern lights are Inari and Levi.
The Northern Lights are the trump card of our winter travel, and they are strongly associated with the heart of winter and snowy landscapes.
There is a great demand for Lapland’s winter aurora borealis trips, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Lights season starts early in the autumn and continues well into spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the Northern Lights, making the sight twice as fairytale-like, says Visit Finland’s Acting Marketing Manager Anne Lind.
The main target group of Visit Finland’s Northern Lights campaign are wealthy 25-35-year-old Japanese women living in the city, who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, for example, through online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the Universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
The Japanese, however, would like to see more unique sights from Finland, and this is where the Northern Lights have huge potential, according to Lind.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists have grown clearly more in Finland than in the other Nordic countries.
Last year, they spent more than double the number of nights in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
From the point of view of Finnish tourism, the Japanese are an interesting target group, as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain had to settle for silver in Rugby 7 when Fiji’s champion team won gold
The UK’s impressive success in the seven-player rugby tournament was shattered when Fiji defeated it in the final at Deodoro Stadium in Rio on Thursday, 43–7.
Fiji gave the champions lessons in ball handling, transfers, side diversions, support play, running lines, and brutal force, and won gold—if it was the country’s first Olympic medal in its history.
The loss meant silver, which was a slightly meagre consolation for Britain, as it was the country's third silver of the same day. They can be proud of their success as an Olympic sport in the first-ever rugby-7 tournament, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A tight victory from the South African Boxes in the 7–5 semi-finals earlier that day could have had a negative impact on the team in the finals.
Despite this, Fiji’s team in this form would have beaten the British, even if the 15-strong team had been at full strength.
It may be a comfort for the UK that at least one Briton will receive a gold medal tomorrow: Fiji’s head coach Ben Ryan, a former English rugby-7 coach from Wimbledon.
It has been quite an experience for the UK.
Eight years ago, they lost all the games at the Adelaide Sevens in Ryan's coaching session.
In Rio, they only lost one game.
Losing is painful, but progress is startling.
Fiji got off to a great start and showed off its tackle skills to the UK as if for fun.
It looked as if Captain Tom Mitchell and his team had collided with a group of moving buses, and the world champions took the lead 5-0 when Osea Kolinsau made a dive into the corner.
With four minutes left on the clock, Jerry Tuwai scored another goal to the right of the goal kick.
The score was 12–0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's stunning tackle prevented the stalwart Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third goal, but it didn't slow down Fiji for long.
After seven minutes of play, Jasa Veremalua scored in the right-hand corner, leading the UK to a 17–0 loss.
Nakarawa scored a second goal from the start, with more than a minute left in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then plunged through the team's increasingly feeble tackles and swerved across the finish line.
After the penalty shootout, the opening period ended with 29–0.
It seemed that Fijians were born to play seven-player rugby, while the British are still in the role of apprentices.
Which is largely true.
Great Britain made large-scale changes in the half and managed to hold the Fijians for a whole four minutes, which was a good performance compared to the first half, until Josua Tuisova scored thanks to the excellent team play of the Fijians.
Dan Norton managed to narrow the situation down to 36-7 by scoring for Great Britain in the left corner, but the game was long lost to the South Seas archipelagoers, whose fans in the stands sang, waved flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire Fiji’s purely joyful attitude.
Mata Viliame made the final touch to the Fijian cake by scoring in the last moments.
The whistle rang, the Fijians embraced each other and the British fell on the field, completely crushed.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had won Japan's semi-final by 20–5 and the UK had slipped past South Africa in a tight semi-final, where the tie was decided by a British goal kick.
Kyle Brown led the South African Boxers in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with his dazzling footwork and plunged under the goalposts in the second half.
Marcus Watson, the brother of England’s 15-man rugby player Anthony Watson, sealed the victory and eventually the silver medal.
Coach’s fight against cancer spurred Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to row gold
The gold in these races couldn't be more emotional than this.
From first to last bet, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning rowed through history with 220 winning bets and found an additional purpose for their golden moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
Despite the fact that they were two in the oars, the third voice echoed in the boat, the voice of coach Robin Williams, which encouraged them to their second consecutive Olympic gold medal in the women's doubles. This makes them the first women in the history of British sports to achieve a similar feat.
Their superiority was undisputed, the victory for them was already the 39th in a row and once again a record.
What we see, two brilliant athletes bonding on the surface of the water like swans to age, does not fully match the nature of success.
Behind every rowing gold there is a large number of helping hands, each of which has contributed to the achievement of the pair. However, the most important of the assistants is the coach who was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago and who at that time did not know if he would see today.
Williams said the situation was tough at the time.
"I had bladder cancer, and the tumor could be removed.
Without the surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
And it would have been pretty bad.
It changes my mind a bit.”
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky to be able to start their treatment in the off-season in early 2014, when the suspension caused as little harm as possible, if one can even say so in such circumstances.
"I needed money, so I had to heal quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walking around the ward 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said a few steps is enough.
That's where it starts.
The rowing in itself is a journey, but this made it a bit bigger."
Immediately after the win, the duo's thoughts were with Williams, who had spent a nervous morning and talked a little more than normal in an attempt to overcome his own anxiety.
Captain Stanning of the British Royal Artillery, who had a tour of Afghanistan behind him, says: “At an emotional level, I’ve been in ruins this week, which may be a bit extreme, but it means so much.”
“It just goes to show how much this means to me and how much we’ve worked with Helen and Robin.
The last three years of Helen and Robin's coffers have been fantastic.
Without Robin we would be nothing, so huge thanks to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have asked for a better coach or a better coach.”
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The two have found a superior rhythm that their rivals have not been able to match.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the New Zealand and Denmark doubles began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
“We were very close in an instant.
Helen kept saying, "Stay with me, stay with me."
It is very important not to stray off the path.”
"We were able to leave well, and at the same time we didn't try to do anything amazing.
We weren’t looking for the sky today, we just wanted to do a good rowing and win the race that we did.”
The two think for a year before deciding on their future.
Glover will be celebrating his wedding next month with Steve Backshall, who is familiar with the nature shows on TV.
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say it was my last race.
That would have been too much pressure.”
“It took me about six months after London to realise that I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
This time it took about four minutes.
“It feels so much better,” he says.
Iceland to change government after Panama leaks
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which protesters, angered by Panama leaks, called for in the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that a number of Icelandic politicians evaded taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but that was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election date has now been set for October 29.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the popular outrage last spring will affect the election results in the autumn.
In the June presidential elections, the critical attitude towards those in power was clearly visible, and Gudni Johannesson, a non-political candidate, was elected president.
Trump says he was sarcastic when he accused Obama of being the founder of ISIS
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump retracted his latest rant.
He said he was being sarcastic when he claimed that President-elect Barack Obama was involved in the founding of the terrorist organization ISIS and that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was also involved in the founding of the organization.
The Democratic Party was outraged by the remarks and demanded an apology from Trump.
No one should ever be allowed to become the commander-in-chief of an army who can sink so low.
In the south of France, the mayor of Cannes has banned Muslims from wearing burkini swimwear on beaches, according to the Guardian.
The resolution, signed by Mayor David Lisnard, states that access to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not have a bathing suit that respects good manners and secularism.
The decision also says that swimsuits, which show a high degree of religious affiliation, may increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating French National Day.
In late July, two men linked to the Islamic State group attacked a church in northern France and killed an 80-year-old priest.
The quality of bathing waters in the Oulu region passed the screening - Blue-green algal haze in Pyyk<0xC3><0xB6>sjärvi
The water samples taken from the official bathing areas in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements set for bathing water.
Only blue-green algae turbidity has been observed at the Pyyk<0xC3><0xB6>sjärvi beach.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region’s Environment Department took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public beaches in the Oulu Region.
With the exception of Meriniemi beach, the concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococci in all bathing waters were below the action limits set in the decrees of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and enterococci concentrations in Meriniemi beach water were confirmed on Wednesday, when the bacterial concentrations had fallen below the action limits.
The blue-green algal bloom observed at the Pyyk<0xC3><0xB6>sjärvi beach does not yet make the water unsuitable for swimming, but in favourable conditions the situation can quickly change to blue-green algal bloom, when blue-green algal mass forms on the surface of the water as rafts.
The environmental action will monitor the situation through intensified inspections.
If the blue-green algae clouding turns into blue-green algae bloom, this will also be announced separately on the beach information board.
See the results of bathing water samples here.
MTK’s Hakkarainen on forest gift reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside
The forest gift deduction is one tax change in the Ministry of Finance’s budget proposal for next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax deduction that would be granted on the basis of gift tax.
The Ministry of Finance’s proposal for forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote the generational changes of forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest holdings and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry’s objective is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
A forest owner would make a deduction from forestry’s pure capital income.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote generational renewal of forest holdings is good,” says Juha Hakkarainen, Director of Forestry at the Federation of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners (MTK).
However, there is some criticism of the tax reform proposal.
A forest gift deduction is proposed from the forest owner’s pure capital income.
It is capital income from which all other deductions have been deducted.
According to MTK and Hakkarainen, the tax deduction would be more effective if the deduction could be made directly from the sales revenue of the timber.
The Ministry of Finance’s proposal is based on the premise that by making a deduction from forestry’s pure capital income, the loss of forestry’s capital income would be prevented on the basis of the deduction, which would be deducted in other taxation.
Such a person would receive a tax benefit even if he did not sell the tree.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner is unable to perceive it, says Hakkarainen.
The model also applies to only a small number of forest owners.
The tax deduction limit linked to the yield value of the forest is EUR 40,000 in the proposal.
It has been pulled too high in the opinion of Hakkarainen.
As such, it removes 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners from the scope of the deduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10 per cent of forest owners, he says.
According to the Ministry of Finance, the border guarantees the goal of increasing the farm size.
According to Hakkarainen, forest policy has been reducing forest gifts for decades.
This is due to the ageing of forest owners.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60, and about half of the forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful hailstorm surprised motorists in Himanka - two cars plunged into a ditch and collided with each other
There was a strange chase in the Himanka of Kalajoki on Friday morning.
According to the rescue services, two cars that had driven in a row ended up in a ditch, after which the one behind collided with the one behind.
According to the on-call fire marshal Harri Pyyhtyä, it is suspected that the fall into the ditch was caused by a strong hailstone.
There were two people in the back of the car, both of whom were taken to the hospital for treatment.
There is no specific information about their injuries.
The driver of the car was not injured.
The accident happened on highway 8 from Himanka to Kalajoki, a few kilometres away.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
New research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help develop cancer treatments to be even more effective.
The findings made by Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska’s research group show that the hardness of a cancerous tumor increases the malignancy of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow normally in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of the cancer could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer therapies may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells.
The results of the study have been published on August 4 in the prestigious journal Nature Communications in the field of cell biology.
Muhos’s family home murder continues to be discussed at the court, prosecutor also demands a murder sentence for another perpetrator
The murder of the Muhos family home continues at the court for both convicted offenders.
In June, two young men were sentenced to prison for the murder of a family home in Muhos.
One was given 8 years and 4 months for, among other things, manslaughter as a young person and aggravated robbery.
The second is sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
A person convicted of manslaughter was also convicted of aggravated endangerment of traffic safety as a young person and of driving a vehicle without a right as a young person.
The district court’s decision was appealed by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs and the man who received a harsher sentence.
The prosecutor is seeking a lesser sentence for murder of a young person, to 12 years in prison.
They were in full understanding at the time.
According to the district court, a 17-year-old young man who worked as a director of the school’s child protection unit was killed in July last year.
The 17-year-old convicted of murder attacked the director sitting on the couch in the living room from behind.
The director had let go of his grip and led the young man to his room, where one of the young men hit him with a vacuum cleaner.
Among other things, the director was strangled, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to the mental health survey, both of the convicts were in full understanding at the time.
According to the court, the young people had planned to flee the family home at least from the previous day.
The ice shark is the world's longest-living vertebrate, breeding only at the age of 156
The world’s longest living vertebrate is the ice shark, according to a study published in the journal Science.
An ice shark, or holker, that swims around Greenland in the northern Atlantic Ocean can live up to 400 years.
The female does not reproduce until she is 156.
The life span of an ice shark is increased by the fact that it only grows by one centimeter per year.
Only one species of shellfish is known to outlive ice sharks.
The researchers found out the age by radiocarbon dating.
Due to nuclear testing in the 1950’s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
The researchers were able to estimate the age of the sharks.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years old - although the throw in one direction or the other can be as long as 120 years.
Donald Trump's economic wisdom - People's News
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need anything else.
As much as a third of the country’s total tax revenue would be lost if the corporate tax change advocated by Donald Trump is implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular through tax reliefs benefiting the wealthiest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he unveiled it in Detroit on Monday.
The corporate tax rate would fall from 35% to 15%.
We would be missing out on a huge sum of $1,000 billion a year.
The top income tax rate is now 39.6 per cent, after Trump’s proposed reduction of 33 per cent.
Inheritance tax would be abolished.
Trump accused the U.S. of over-regulating the economy and bankrupting small businesses.
The environmental standards decided on in haste must be re-established and the energy sector deregulated.
Barack Obama’s health care reform needs to be addressed again.
We need to appoint “experts” instead of “bureaucrats”.
“Destructive” trade policy is one of the main causes of U.S. problems, Trump said.
Free trade agreements should be abolished.
Imports from China would be subject to a 45% penalty, while imports from Mexico would be subject to a 35% penalty.
We offer a new future.
“Americanism, not globalism, is our creed,” Trump said.
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need anything else in the world:
American cars will drive through the streets, American planes will connect cities, American ships will control the seas, American steel will lift new skyscrapers all over the country.
Contrary to his habits, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by his aides, even though it was interrupted 14 times by well-organized protests.
Economists—including those close to Republicans—see Trump’s program taking the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own program on Friday.
A tsunami from the past - Kansan Uutiset
The sea is turbulent, but a tidal wave strikes amid the hustle and bustle of Madrid - the reckoning with the past can begin.
That is the essence of Pedro Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var’s new story.
Almodovari’s previous directorial work, Travel Lovers (2013), was a satirical comedy with a funny and raunchy side, preceding the film The Skin I Live In (2011), which was one of the highlights of my Spanish career.
Julieta (2016) is somewhere between those two works.
It is a conventionally serene love, relationship and family drama that focuses on the relationship between mother and daughter.
The story is simple and is largely seen as a long flashback.
Life seems to be going well for the middle-aged title character (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a random encounter, her new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) is left in awe all the way to the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta repeats the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
He begins with the time before his daughter is born, the moments when he met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher from the series Between Stitches (2013-2014), will rise to the second leading role.
Julieta’s aging has been handled in a way that can be considered a mess, but I would say quite neatly and literally with a single swipe.
Julieta has a fair distance to the flamboyance that is often so characteristic of Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var films, even in humour.
It is an equally strong, subdued film with good music and quite melancholy in some places, with elements of elegia as such.
On the other hand, the visual saturation typical of the Spanish director is still there, and in a way that slowly begins to catch the eye as a pure formality rather than a functional dramatic effect.
The characters of the film suffer illness, death or other sudden losses, but the surface remains just as Korean.
This is especially true of costumes: in the case of the title character, the outfits change from one scene to another, and the same is true of spectacular earrings.
Mr Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var is precise in these matters, but the main point, the settings of the current scene, does not get much better from this.
When repeated mechanically, the impression is external and a little inanimate.
Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var has written a screenplay based on three short stories by Canadian novelist Alice Munro, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2013.
The short stories have been published in The Fugitive: Stories.
Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var has invested in dialogue, resulting in a little bit of literary filmisation.
There would have been a lot of material for even the most emotionally robust drama, so many big things - especially the gnawing guilt - that the theme of the film deals with.
Written and directed by Pedro Almod<0xC3><0xB3>var.
Based on three short stories by Alice Munro.
Starring Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao and Dario Grandinetti.
The film premieres on August 12.
Government tries election rigging - People's News
There will be no further cuts, ministers keep repeating, so that the Finns Party does not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring are being carried out profusely.
There will be no further cuts.
The four billion savings already decided are enough.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (National Coalition Party) say during the budget session.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the Ministry’s proposal, because cuts in social security were already decided in the spring’s spending limits discussion.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index will be cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment security will be reduced from 500 days to 400.
The educational cuts continue.
Muntavaalit
Why are the ministers so keen to emphasise precisely that no further cuts will be made on top of these?
Because next year is an election year.
The municipal elections will be held in April and they are the most important thermometer of the parliamentary term, not the polls.
It has been seen before that the result of the municipal elections of the government parties in different directions will ruin the atmosphere of the government for a long time.
However, the polls indicate that the government party expects the Finns Party to lose out, even though the result of its previous elections was a modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns Party received 752 new councillors, most of whom will receive the right-wing government’s fee next spring.
The lifeblood of the government of three parties of approximately equal size depends on the persistence of the Finns Party.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted for the party had had enough of government policy already in the first year.
The first signs of the party’s parliamentary group’s fermentation have also surfaced.
The 'no new cuts' rhetoric, firstly, obscures the fact that next year they will be carried out drastically and, secondly, attempts are being made to soften the blow awaiting the Finns Party.
Major cuts in 2018?
A year from now, everything will probably be different – if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The Government has set itself the target of reducing indebtedness during this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo’s budget proposal will take out EUR 5.9 billion in debt next year, which is more than this year.
After the elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands at the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to follow its own programme: the debt will not be reduced or even slowed down.
The other is to stick to the program.
This means even tougher cuts in the 2017 budget.
The budget would be pushed at least close to balance during 2018, and then in the spring parliamentary elections will decide what comes next.
With these measures, indebtedness does not bend
It is quite clear that with the current measures, indebtedness will not be broken, even if Juha Sipilä tries to create a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäki at the budget awareness event prove this irrefutably:
Forecasts of global economic growth have repeatedly proved to be overoptimistic, i.e. there will be no pull from the international economy.
Finland’s national economy has not risen much since the collapse of 2008 except temporarily during the stimulus policy of the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in the last decade, with an average increase from 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion a year more than in 2008.
With the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60 per cent limit in 2014, will rise to 70 per cent in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt rescheduling proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost about six billion euros, which will be practically covered by taking on entirely new debt.
This is the view of the Centre Party, the National Coalition Party and the Finns Party of what is responsible.
Questionnaire: Municipalities should be given a lot of tasks
Three out of four believe that organising child day care, youth work and physical activity is the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by the KAKS - Foundation for Development of Local Government.
A clear majority of the population also assigns responsibility for libraries, culture, civic schools, building supervision, upper secondary school education and waste management to an individual municipality.
The county is most clearly responsible for regional planning, specialised medical care, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for the mentally disabled.
There is no wish to delegate any of the tasks of the municipalities to the state.
Underage drunk driver ends up running away from police
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu ran away from a police patrol on Ilomantsitie in Joensuu on Friday night at 1:30 a.m.
A police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle without lights, but the young man ran away from the police at a fair speed.
The chase continued to Sonkajanrantie, from where on to Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle ran off the road.
Still after this the young man ran away, but the faster-footed policeman caught the fugitive.
The breath test for the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a driver’s license to drive a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated as, for example, an aggravated endangerment of traffic safety.
A truck in a pile of rock fell into a ditch.
A truck loaded with stones fell into a ditch at Kaavintie in Polvijärvi on Thursday evening at 9.15 p.m.
The truck had driven off the road in a bend to the left and had fallen on its side into a ditch.
The rescue service lifted the injured driver out of the crashed truck through the door above, together with the rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
Lifting the vehicle was left to the car owner.
Hydraulic oil was spilled on the road from the crashed truck and the rescue department sucked it into the peat.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon.
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since this afternoon in the village of Lahdenkylä in Ilmajoki, South Ostrobothnia.
Police are looking for a woman who is about 165 cm tall, thin and well-groomed and has white hair under her chin.
You can call the Ostrobothnian Situation Centre on 0295440513 for observations and hints about the missing person’s movements.
Elements of a major accident in the air - see photo gallery Parafest's devastation
The surge that knocked down the Parafest festival tents caused extensive damage.
Arto Pippuri, President of the Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will get on its feet financially, and the event can also be held next year.
The last performer of the Parafest was Kalle Salonen.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with performances at the City Theatre starting at 1 p.m.
There is a Parafest exhibition at Ahjo Art Centre between 1pm and 3pm.
The programme will be organised as planned.
The surge current is generated in a thunder cloud when the rainwater and its weight initiate a descending air flow.
Changes in the water state of a thunder cloud bind heat, and thus the falling air mass cools and its speed towards the ground accelerates.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, several surges occur in Finland during the summer.
The route of the surges is difficult to predict.
The surge hit the back yard of the Joensuu Art Museum, which was the venue for Parafest, on Friday afternoon before 5 p.m.
Three of the tents fell down, and the total number of people in the tents was about 200.
Four people were slightly injured in the accident.
Among them was one child who was transported with minor injuries for further treatment.
Air pollution is ageing Londoners
According to research, the skin of Londoners ages faster than usual.
The cause of skin ageing is air pollution.
The British study is called the Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyses the most toxic particles in London’s air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that many retired Londoners have skin two and a half years older than, say, their rural counterparts.
Skin-aging fine particles are a very fine form of dust pollution that originates from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, kill nearly 9,500 Londoners every year.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early ageing is a risk, especially for Londoners who walk to work in crowded streets.
Residents of London can try to protect themselves from air pollution with masks, for example, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
The tractor's brakes failed. Pushed a man in front of it.
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
When he got out of the tractor and went to run in front of it, the tractor’s brakes failed and the tractor ran over the man.
The man did not fall under it, but the tractor was able to push the man enough that he was taken to the central hospital for further examination, seriously injured.
The tractor did not have time to run any further, as it hit the rocks in front of it.
A new strength for the coming season
Joensuu-based Liiga-Riento, who plays in the Volleyball Championship League, will start the series starting in October from a better starting point than in memory.
The team has been together for almost three weeks now.
I’m sure we can find common ground better than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
Jani Säisä, who will continue as the head coach of Riento, praises the new team as enterprising and united.
Fred Musoni starts his second season in Riento.
The new faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who played for the Rwanda national team, is a quarter-inch chipper.
Garchet, by contrast, is a passari, the Brazilian has a size of 198 centimeters.
Through Josban, Kataja and Jokipoikat to U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost every World Floorball Championships since 2003.
The sixth edition of the World Championships is now underway in Tampere, only 2013 was missed after Canada was better in North American qualifiers.
I was working in Turku and playing in the local women’s club when I noticed the advertisement.
The United States formed the national floorball team.
I was interested and here I am, 48, says Jumppanen.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near Elizabeth, New York.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, there was no such sport as floorball.
The game was played in college.
I played basketball in Kataja and later ice hockey in Jokipojt in Finnish championship, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played in the Finnish Floorball Championship with the university in 1991-92, the next three seasons were spent in Josba.
In addition to playing, he coached the A-girls to the championship.
Women's Finnish Championship career culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played 10 seasons in the Finnish Women’s Championship, the balance was 51+34<0x3D>85 in 169 games.
The most recent season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen were named to the national team
Josban was raised by Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen was selected to join the Finnish national team, which plays in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
The 25-year-old Perttu Puska has played six men’s international games in Helsinki, where he has scored a total of 9+4<0x3D>13 points.
Tatu Väänänen, the 32-year-old defender of the Swiss side Wiler-Ersigen, has recovered from a leg injury and is part of the national team’s standard equipment with 117 international matches.
The national team also included Mika Kohonen, a veteran of the Seinäjoki Gaming Club, who was last seen in the Finland shirt at last December’s World Cup.
The head coach of the floorball team is Petri Kettunen from Kontiolahte.
Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - Finnish Championship gold is missing from the trophy cabinet
Essi Hasu is finishing as a beach volley player at least temporarily after the current season.
The Finnish championships of Beach volley will be decided this weekend at Kouvola Sports Park.
Over the course of three days, the medals will be played in both adult and junior series.
In co-operation with the Kouvola Volleyball Federation and the Finnish Volleyball Association, the six best pairs in each league ranking are eligible for the final tournament.
The local colour in the tournament is represented by Elimäki’s YMCA bred Essi Hasu, who has been one of the top beach volleys in Finland for several years.
Nowadays living in Helsinki, Hasu is looking forward to the games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get to see it this weekend.
I'm sure there's a great arena coming to the Pesis Stadium.
I haven’t played in the adult leagues in Kouvola very often, so it’s great to play in the finals at home,” Hasu says.
The Kouvola region lit up Hasu’s spark for sports and provided a good starting point for a great hobby.
I have fond memories of childhood.
I started playing volleyball at the age of 9 in Elimäki’s YMCA E-girls.
The top of my mind is a shirt that is too big, knee pads that roll around in my ankles, as well as awesome ace screams and choreographies after the point,” Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close-knit community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit created an environment where it was fun to play.
All the families were strongly involved - the father of the teammate coached us and our mother was the club’s president for a long time.
For Essi Hasu, beach volley was already a natural choice of sport to counterbalance indoor volleyball.
The beach at the curve pond has been used as a beach game since the 1990s.
The action has always been active.
I also went to watch the Finnish Junior Championships, thinking that one day I would be there to play.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays together with Pieksämäkeläinen Anniina Parkkinen in the Finnish Championship finals.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-placed pair is clear.
A realistic goal is a medal.
We're still short of SM-gold in the trophy cabinet, Hasu throws mysteriously.
This weekend’s performance in Kouvola may be Hasu’s last performance in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges in the field of civilian work await.
The international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, the flip-flops will be put on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
Flooding toppled tents at disabled people’s event in Joensuu, a major accident was near

Salomon Koli bravely became an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as an entrepreneur means risk-taking, sweating and vigor.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future also in rural areas.
Almost two years ago, Koli and his little brother Valtteri Koli started operating as a successor to their home farm.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers through his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant taking on debt and increasing the size of the farm so that the bread could come from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I have always enjoyed working on the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur myself, I have put everything into the game.
If you want to start something, you have to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started to build a barn without a yard, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
However, I joined the project with great courage and have been fully involved in it, Salomon Koli says and adds that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in producing clean Finnish food and that everything will turn out well.
Salomon Koli, which grows cattle, aims to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has yielded results, as Salomon Koli has been selected among the top ten in the competition of the young food producer of Maaseudun Tulevaisuus magazine.
He is now competing for a possible win.
You can vote for him on the magazine’s website until 21 August.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, monthly inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest in many years (after June 2012) and the first time it has risen to more than zero since October last year when the country reported positive inflation of 0.2 percent.
The CPI average annual inflation over the last 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015) was -0.8%.
Compared to June 2016, the Consumer Price Index in July 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) has been -0.2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, prices of the following consumer goods groups increased: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), recreation and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household appliances and scheduled maintenance (0.5%) and health (0.1%).
The prices of the following product groups remained at the same level as in the previous month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, dwellings, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat’s Anime Effect Criticized as Asian Caricature
Snapchat says the filter was inspired by anime, but some observers say it’s racist.
With Snapchat’s lens tool, about 150 million daily users can change reality and play with identity in ways that come close to absurdity.
You can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character in a painting by Roy Lichtenstein.
Lenses are unadorned, feature-distorting tools that create more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All missteps quickly become public knowledge.
Snapchat’s lenses have been criticized for favoring blackface make-up or bleached skin tones as a beauty ideal.
So when it offered some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes crooked, distorted their teeth, and made their cheeks plump, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people ("yellowface").
Critics also wondered if these repeated contradictions point to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage spread widely on Wednesday and was reported by online publications The Verge and Motherboard the day after Snapchat said it had removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was intended as a tribute to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some strongly opposed the anime.
Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweet about the images was widely shared, said in an email that the lens was "at least offensive and embarrassing."
He adds: “It’s hard to deny that a very distasteful Asian caricature is equated with filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not just a "yellowface", but one that has been taken to a derogatory extreme."
Snapchat isn’t the only company that needs to avoid these cultural traps.
In American culture, there seems to be an endless struggle for diversity and social inclusion, from corporate boards to Hollywood and the devices we carry with us.
Snapchat’s general audience consists of young people who are more ethnically diverse than their older counterparts. This may mean that they are more likely to expect tact even more.
"When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that offends a user, things like this are no longer very easily overlooked, as before," said Katie Zhu, 25, in an interview on Thursday.
Zhu, who works as a product manager and designer on the Medium publishing platform, decided on Thursday to delete his Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In a Medium article and in a telephone interview, he said he believed ethnic conflicts reflected a lack of appreciation for diversity in Snapchat’s recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the company's largely white-and-male leadership and concluded his writing with the hashtag #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's either that their one-sided staff don't have people of color, so they can make decisions like this, or they have people of color as employees, too, but they're not in a position to have the courage to express their opinions directly and easily," Zhu said.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to respond to the claim.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its staff, citing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the ethnic backgrounds of its staff, but its spokesman said the company had recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented groups of people and promoting inclusion within the company.
For his part, Zhu says he will keep his Snapchat account closed and adds, “I wonder if they really need more users like us to be able to say that this is not OK.”
Congressional Experts Say Military Officials Distorted Intelligence About ISIS
A congressional panel of experts released a report on Thursday that U.S. military officials in the Central Command changed intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than the events on the ground suggested.
The Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee's subcommittee on Intelligence and Defence set up a task force to report on the "general dissatisfaction" of military intelligence analysts, who said senior military officials were belittling their assessment of the Americans' actions against ISIS.
Central Command, or Centcom for short, is the headquarters of the United States Armed Forces in Tampa, Florida, responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence findings approved by Centcom's senior leadership tended to give a more positive picture of U.S. counter-terrorism efforts than the facts on the ground, and were invariably more positive than analyses by other units in the intelligence community," the report said.
“Centcom’s events are unacceptable – our soldiers suffer when high-level policymakers are presented with false analyses,” said Ken Calvert, the Republican representative from California.
“Mistakes by Centcom’s management reach the top of the organization.”
The 10-page report details ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015 with Central Command’s descriptions and analyses of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.
While the report does not contain conclusive evidence that the reports commissioned by the Obama administration were falsified, it does give analysts an impression that Centcom’s leaders were pressuring them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by ISIS.
“In the first half of 2015, many of the Central Command’s press releases, statements, and testimony to Congress were far more positive than the events actually were,” the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major military offensive to recapture Mosul could take place as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, is still under ISIS control.
"After months of research, this is very clear," Kansas Republican Representative Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
"From mid-2014 to mid-2015, top U.S. military intelligence leaders manipulated intelligence findings to downplay the threat of ISIS in Iraq."
The group was set up by Republicans after they learned of analysts' suspicions that intelligence about ISIS had been manipulated.
The report, which was published on Thursday, will be followed by more detailed results, as the investigations are still ongoing.
In addition, a Department of Defense inspector general has opened an investigation into Centcom’s intelligence.
On Thursday, Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own results, which were partially in line with the Republican Working Group’s conclusions.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly-restricted process for evaluating intelligence on ISIS and Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Schiff, the committee’s senior Democratic representative.
Schiff said the process "delayed the release of intelligence, violated analysts' morale" and "addressed insufficiently divergent views."
Schiff and the Democrats said there was no evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to align its conclusions with a “pre-determined or political official line.”
The Daily Beast reported Tuesday on preliminary findings from a congressional investigation.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an investigation by a Pentagon inspector general that began as a result of lawsuits filed by Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report as long as the inspector general's investigation is ongoing.
However, he says, “Experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these key national security issues.”
The investigation has other repercussions, in addition to seeking to ascertain whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (a claim made by an increasing number of defence officials).
However, the allegations made last year cast doubt on how much President Obama can rely on Central Command to provide honest assessments of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of intelligence on ISIS echoes disagreements that arose more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study showing that President George W. Bush’s government, despite protests from many analysts, supported only a small number of troops in Iraq and spent little time reflecting on the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the insurrection against ISIL intelligence.
Last year, Hooker’s team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes on ISIL-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group’s economy, as it had built temporary refineries and was thus able to sell oil on the black market.
However, the results of the study were not transmitted outside of Central Command, The Times reported in September.
Centcom's then-Commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after several lawmakers judged the testimony given to the Senate to be too positive an assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel as commander of Central Command.
U.S. Wins Fourth Duel in Women's Field Hockey and Consolidates Its Position in a Battle with Britain
After scoring three goals in a winning 6-1 game against Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's national field hockey team on Thursday, when the U.S. defeated India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but the 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had achieved the same feat before.
“I have no idea,” he says.
"I'm not one of those people who likes to keep track of the paints they make."
What he does know is that the Americans have won four games in their Olympic tournament, lost zero games, and share the first place in their group with Britain, who continued their winning streak by beating Japan 2–0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will play each other on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams made it to the final, which will determine which of them will be the first and second place in the group of six teams.
The first-placed player avoids a long-term confrontation with the hard-won Dutch team that won the second group.
Despite how Saturday’s game is going, the Americans have already raised a stir about their surprising success at these games, four years after it was the last of the 12 teams to finish in the London Olympics.
Bam was also on the team in London.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and did not catch a field hockey bat for the first time until he was three years old (his older twin sisters played for Drexel). He was promoted to the national team at the age of 16, making him the youngest ever national team player.
He missed the 2008 Olympics when he failed to make the final roster.
This was followed by the 2012 Games, where he and his team saw little success.
The following year, English coach Craig Parnham was appointed, after which things began to change.
“The change was cultural, mental and physical,” says Bam.
"Our time in London was not what it is now.
We've made a U-turn."
On Thursday night, Bam opened a goal account in the first half by hitting the ball close up with a knuckle punch.
India had entered the game without a single tournament win, but it proved to be a surprisingly tough opponent and maintained a 1–0 lead until the third period, when Bam stepped onto the pitch.
Bam carried the ball along the left side of the field for a long time, squirmed into the midfield, hitting the ball to the finish line, leading the Americans 2–0.
Melissa Gonzalez scored her final goal in the middle of the fourth episode.
The game was the first in which the American goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games, the American goal was sunk by one hit in each.
Briggs is now in his season of success,
Same as Bam.
“Our ranking is good now,” says Parnham, “but how good it is depends on the result of Saturday’s game.
In the midst of the Olympic bustle, the trampoline brings zen
No matter the time or place, the Olympics are inevitable.
The events, races and struggles of Rio de Janeiro seem to be a constant, passionate message everywhere.
As if the Olympic flame itself was a flaming baton that passed from archer to swimmer, from swimmer to gymnast and from gymnast to triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in a coffee shop queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
Olympic first-timer Dooley charms with her smile and might well be the name on everyone’s lips that would be seen and heard at peak viewing and listening time, would be popular with sponsors, and would appear in good-humored TV commercials if she were a swimmer, gymnast, or even a fencer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, competes for Olympic gold on a trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all competitions equally.
Further away from the center, in part in the shade, are lesser-known sports such as air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, and taekwondo.
We will always have a breaststroke, and may the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I may write a modest article about my own special favorites, I would like to draw attention to the understated charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since the 2000 Sydney Games, its visibility over the last 16 years has been so low that many of the people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic sport.
Ignorance can be regional.
The U.S. has participated in the Olympic trampoline, but has never won a medal or progressed to the finals until 2012.
On the men’s trampoline, the medals seem to go to the Chinese and Russians, and on the women’s side, the medals have been won by Canadians.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend the gold medals they won in London this year.
However, the trampoline has the charm of an underdog. Partly because to an uneducated ear it sounds more suitable for circus school than for the Olympics.
(I’m not an expert, just a fan.)
The species has its comic potential, which has been used in cartoons in the characters’ endless bounce scenes. But it also has the same dignity as gymnastics and swimming, i.e. the species that essentially combine on the trampoline.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampol<0xC3><0xAD>n, which means "bounce board".
Ambitious champions jump on a huge trampoline, which catapults them to a height of almost 10 meters. Before landing on their feet, the jumpers must perform a series of acrobatic movements such as twists, folds and flips.
According to the official Olympic program, jumps are judged on performance, difficulty and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 different countries compete for the trampoline gymnastics championship, 16 of them men and 16 women.
The most common direction for Olympic sports is straight ahead.
In the pursuit of gold, medal hopes must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes over the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
In addition to the finish line or the starting wall, they also have another goal they pursue in televised reports, namely, world or Olympic records.
This determined pursuit is sublime, admirable, even fanatical – and it is enough even to bring the viewer to tears.
But I also find it a bit exhausting just to watch the games.
This trampoline offers a breather.
On the trampoline, the direction is upwards.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast bounces up weightless like an astronaut, falls down and bounces back up effortlessly.
Of course, there’s also the competitive aspect, and it’s not easy either, but it doesn’t involve a frantic rush to the finish line or jumping far, it’s just a dreamy and fluid combination of time and gravity.
It’s as close to Zen as an Olympic competition can get.
Women’s qualifiers and finals will take place on Friday afternoon and start at 13:00 local time and men’s corresponding games on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of their afternoon broadcast, which will start at 2:00 p.m. local time on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic mania bring a peaceful and wonderful moment, which in the midst of the general hustle and bustle might go unnoticed.
And if awareness can only be raised by offering appealing male athletes to watch and objectifying them — as U.S. male gymnasts recently suggested, according to the Wall Street Journal — then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his panting new crowd of fans.
A whole generation protested in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the United States
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Government forces have violently dispersed demonstrations calling for political change across Ethiopia.
Witnesses said several protesters were shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia falling apart?
For the past decade, it has been one of Africa’s most stable countries and a reliable Western ally with a rapidly growing economy.
In recent months, however, the country has been shaken by anti-government demonstrations, which are spreading to ever wider areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people took to the streets demanding radical political change.
According to human rights groups, the government’s response was merciless.
Witnesses said police shot and killed several unarmed protesters.
Video footage of the demonstrations, presumably at the end of last year or the beginning of this year, shows security forces using sticks to hit young people who have been forced to stand with their hands against a wall.
The UN’s chief human rights officer is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"Keeping the country united has always been difficult, and moving forward has been even more difficult," says Rashid Abdi, Research Director of the International Crisis Group of the Horn of Africa project.
Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa after Nigeria, and has been supported by the West.
The US military and intelligence services are closely supporting the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, particularly in Somalia, where few, if any, African countries receive this much help from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy is growing at a rapid pace.
Its infrastructure has radically improved, and there is even a new urban train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
The streets of the cities are usually calm, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still a long way from being a model country for democracy: human rights organisations have constantly reported on the repressive policies of the government, opposition in the country is very limited and dissidents are being quickly silenced.
Many people have been driven out of the country, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the wilderness.
But the situation may be changing.
"If a people is repressed and has no choice but to demonstrate, it will erupt," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
“All the young people are protesting.
A whole generation is protesting.”
There are many topics of dissatisfaction, ranging from land use to the government coalition’s stranglehold on power.
After last year's widely criticised elections, the ruling party and its allies took the last seat previously held by the opposition and, as a result, they now govern the whole of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are escalating along the Eritrean border, where the escalating situation claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less defeated in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden People's Liberation Front, may seek to exploit the chaos and rearm themselves.
There are many reasons why the bitter mood that has been smoldering under the surface for years is erupting right now.
The first is obviously innocent: smartphones.
It is only in the last couple of years that Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social media, as cheaper smartphones have become commonplace and access to the internet has improved.
Even when the government repeatedly blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during protests, many still access the internet via proxy servers that encrypt their whereabouts.
Many young Ethiopians reported that this was how they invited people to the demonstrations.
Another reason is the increase in solidarity between the two largest populations in Ethiopia, the Oromo and the Amhara.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.
Amharic people from the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia have long dominated the country’s politics and business and exploited the Oromo, many of whom are Muslim and live in the lowlands.
But this is also changing.
“The collaboration is deepening and we are getting under the same umbrella,” says oromo director Mulatu Gemechu.
The largest demonstrations have taken place in the Oromo and Amharic regions.
Many Amharic and Oromo people feel that Ethiopia is unjustly ruled by the Tigre tribe, which represents only about six percent of the population and yet controls the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause of the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Meles was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unnamed illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius who could see around the corner.
According to analysts, he was particularly adept at spotting the first signs of discontent and using ambassadors to mediate between opponents.
“The current government lacks this essential instinct,” says conflict researcher Abdi.
Ethiopia’s new Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn stepped into Meles’s shoes from near obscurity.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the security forces run by the Tigre tribe.
Many fear that this will mean more bloodshed.
The last time similar riots took place in Ethiopia was in 2005, when thousands of people protested against the elections, which, according to analysts, were first botched and then stolen by the government.
In the post-election unrest, many protesters were killed, though fewer than in previous months, and the unrest ended relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia’s leaders for far-sighted infrastructure planning, such as the new urban train, and for the significant progress made in the fight against poverty.
But the internal resentment against the Ethiopian government has clearly not prevented it from intensifying.
And the resentment is taking on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month in Gondar, Amharic, protesters attacked tiger-owned businesses, and hate speech against tigers is on the rise on social media.
Analysts say the protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in a difficult situation.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned aerial vehicles monitoring neighboring Somalia, but the base has recently been closed, according to the U.S.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its already unstable ally to collapse.
“It takes a lot of balance,” Abdi said.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic when he accused Obama of being the founder of ISIS
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to retract his words in the latest controversy over his campaign by claiming that he was not serious about claiming several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the terrorist group ISIS.
The clarification raised new questions about the Republican side’s ability to communicate clearly with its citizens.
It is also an embarrassing situation for his supporters, who have to try to justify their candidate in these turbulent times and explain comments that he may not have meant.
Trump made the claim at an election rally on Wednesday night and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed that the president and Hillary Clinton created ISIS.
Earlier on Friday, Trump tweeted that he was being sarcasm.
In a tweet from the previous day, Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When radio host and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by saying Obama was trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate refused to back down.
The latest wave of criticism rose as Trump tried to refocus his campaign on the economy as support fell.
Trump and Clinton held their economic policy talks in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump returned to the subject.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton’s proposals would raise taxes, and said Clinton’s speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm before.
At the end of July, he received widespread criticism when he seemed to urge Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's email. Later, he explained his comments by saying, "Of course I was being sarcastic."
In this way, Trump stretches the boundaries of political speech and retracts his words when necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing certain messages that resonate with his supporters. He watches how the supporters respond to the messages, and then "clarifies" one way or another depending on the reactions," says communications expert Ruth Sherman, who has been monitoring the language used by both presidential candidates.
"But I also believe that he understands his claims and knows that they are circular enough to pass through different sieves."
Instead of softening his statements to the election audience, Trump has in recent days changed his style even more pungent as his support figures have continued to decline.
A new poll released Friday by NBC, the Wall Street Journal and Marist found Trump’s support was significantly lower than that of Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while in Florida it was evenly matched.
While Trump generally tries to avoid apologizing for his provocative speeches, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But ever more closely scrutinized in the final months of his presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have put his loyal supporters in an embarrassing position of publicly defending Trump’s comments, no matter how provocative.
One of Trump’s most prominent supporters, former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, defended the presidential candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
“I think what he said is a well-founded, political speech,” Giuliani said when asked if Trump was truthful in his claims that Obama and Hillary Clinton had founded ISIS.
“It’s true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization that Obama completely mistakenly called a ‘lower-rank team,’ and that’s why it happened, because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.”
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, with Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to continue its activities when it failed to address the situation with determination in the Middle East.
Before the election rally in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, where he accused them of muttering and discriminating against him.
He ridiculed the "inappropriate and pathetic" television commentators who were trying to find out about him, but who, according to him, were unable to do so.
Some Democrats ridiculed Trump’s explanation, saying it only made it clearer that he was unfit to be president.
Café closed due to excessive rent increase opens in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a bit of a shabby café in Williamsburg, where only cash was accepted and there was no Wi-Fi, but which served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the cafe was priced out of its street seat on Bedford Avenue when the rent went up to exorbitant.
Soap Cherie, which replaced Verb Cafe in the summer of 2014, sells soaps in the shape of cupcakes.
The locals find this loss of the cafe, which had to avoid middle-classization, deplorable.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe the CBGB club is no more, the Chelsea Hotel has been destroyed and Verb is now a soap store."
But even though New York is no longer what it used to be, there is also something new being created there.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new café in Greenpoint, just over a kilometre north of its original location.
The new Verb café has Wi-Fi and you can pay with a credit card, but some of the staff are the same and the atmosphere is still unsophisticated.
The coffee is also good.
The owner and manager of the new Verb café is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old café.
He started at Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a client offered to finance the opening of a new café, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, 36, kept many things as they were.
Verb orders the bagels from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso machine model.
In addition, it even reintroduced the lamps of the old Verb.
Rodrigues said he wanted to try something new.
Added new products to the list.
Bacon-egg-cheese sandwiches and capers and browned onion rings are available.
There are also dark rice bodies on the list.
You can no longer get beer from the café, but instead juices made from fresh fruits.
After holding the café for nine months, Rodriguez says he noticed that the old regulars started to visit the Verb in a steady stream.
“Many of our old customers were also priced out of Williamsburg,” he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who visited the café recently on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
After moving to Greenpoint, he took walks in the Verb in Williamsburg.
When Verb was shut down, he said he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized I liked Verb's coffee and culture," he says.
Now he drinks coffee again, even though on that Sunday he took his usual iced coffee instead of the chai tea mix, which is also a novelty on the list.
Another long-time customer, Tom Rosenthal, was a loyal visitor to Verb since 2003.
He used to go to the coffee shop before work, and he always ordered the same thing.
"I walked into the café every day at 15:15, like a machine, and there they already prepared my butter bagel with all the fillings," she says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still orders his standard product, but from time to time he changes his bagel with bacon, egg and cheese fillings.
Rodriguez says he has no hard feelings about the soap store taking over the old place.
The owners of the Soap Cheries even offered to make a special soap using Verb’s own cold brewed coffee.
"We may yet take up the offer," Rodriguez says.
The traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also welcomed the café with joy.
One of the new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez says he is now looking for a place to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has brought other benefits.
A local juice company wants to bottle and sell cold brewed coffee from the café.
The café may also expand into an adjacent building.
For many customers, however, it is enough to get their old favorites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer in Williamsburg, and he says his heart was broken when the coffee shop closed.
When the new place opened and I ordered coffee there, it felt like I had arrived home, says Whitt.
"I miss the smell of coffee."
The Dreary Food of the Great Depression in the New Work: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in his office at the White House.
President Roosevelt, known as a culinary artist, was fond of the luxurious dishes of Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as foie gras and Maryland turtle soup.
On that day, his menu was more modest: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and plum pudding for dessert.
“It was an expression of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering,” says Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message to Americans about how they should eat.”
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights both work as food historians.
Coe’s latest book, Chop Suey, tells the story of Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman’s latest book, 97 Orchard, tells the story of an apartment building in the Lower East Side through food.
Their new collaboration, A Square Meal, published Tuesday by Harper, chronicles the history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity by agreeing to meet with a journalist at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron skyscraper and opened the same year as the Great Stock Market Crash of 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and olive sandwich and Coe, 57, ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When the reporter ordered a meatloaf, the couple said it fits very well into the discussion of eating during the Great Depression.
"The concerns were very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
“People ate peanut butter, liver butter and bean jelly.
They were made of materials that were cheap and plentiful.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to eat the whole meal.”
Andrew Coe is grinning.
“It must have weighed like lead in the stomach,” he says.
Before the Great Depression, the American dining table, especially in the countryside, served on the buffet principle "eat as much as you want".
Women prepared food for farm workers, and freshly baked pies were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal is a chronicle of the ways in which the people survived when abundance was suddenly abandoned.
“This was the time when food became a central and distressing topic for Americans,” says Coe, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new low-cost diet: according to Ziegelman, enigmatic dishes such as stews and casseroles became the staple food, and casseroles were said to be "a great way to make use of leftovers" because chefs could cover less attractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which for years had been a staple of the American meal, became a sparingly used luxury.
We tried strange mixtures, where the most important thing was to meet the calorie and nutritional values, not so much the taste or even the common sense of the kitchen.
While doing research for a book that also includes recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared baked onions stuffed with peanut butter, which were used as a shortage-time dish.
"It did not gain popularity at the dinner table," says Coe, where
Ziegelman adds: "It was unreal.
Peanut butter and oven onion don't go together at all.
This was characteristic of many household recipes."
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Household Administration from 1923 to 1943, guided the eating habits of citizens in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, and encouraged women to be accurate budget keepers and to meet the challenge of making tasty dishes from stuff like carrot-cream pages.
The book A Square Meal is a celebration of historical treats.
Particularly tasty are reports of the government's reactions to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's 'let me eat cake' attitude.
While publicly praising the simple food of his childhood on an Iowa farm, he himself ate, like the millionaire and sophisticated gentleman he had become.
"He liked continental European cuisine, such as fish and cucumber sauce," says Coe.
"He ate almost in a gold-plated dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was completely estranged from reality.”
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to lead by example with her belly.
As reported in the book, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not at all interested in the taste, the food served in the White House was not only the most boring in Washington, but also the most poorly prepared.
Many of the food from the Depression was abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of the tradition is still reflected in how we pay attention to calories and nutrition and how science has been applied to cooking.
While writing the book, the couple said they had begun to better understand Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits, such as why she couldn’t throw away food.
"He was really afraid that the food would have to be thrown away," says Coe.
“People even started to feel sick about his food,” recalls Ziegelman.
“For example, the wind.”
After the main course plates were emptied at the lunch bar in Eisenberg, Ziegelman and Coe brought out their homemade plum dessert, the same one President Roosevelt had for lunch.
“It’s called plum foam,” says Ziegelman and adds that giving a fancy name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no whipped cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We reluctantly immersed our spoons in thick brown goo.
Surprisingly, it didn’t taste bad.
Coe did it a second time and a third time.
“Nuts would make this better,” Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budgeter.
Gilead Receives Full Compensation for Lawyers on Patent Dispute with Merck for Hepatitis C Drug
A U.S. District Court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to full compensation for attorneys’ fees for litigation with Merck & Co., Inc. over a patent for a hepatitis C drug.
In June, Gilead was acquitted of $200 million in damages for violating two patents owned by Merck in connection with the successful drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead. A U.S. judge found that Merck had committed violations, including perjury and other unethical practices.
In a lawsuit filed Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to exemption from attorney fees it incurred in defending the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of anti-hepatitis C drugs that can treat more than 90 percent of hepatitis C patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other for private property rights to sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead’s medicines, which is under laboratory work.
US-backed forces take Manbij city from ISIS
U.S.-backed forces have seized Manjib, near the Turkish border in northern Syria, after the last ISIS fighters left the city, a spokesman for the forces said.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now scouring the city to find the last ISIS fighters hiding in the city.
Sharfan Darwish of the Manbij Military Council, a member of the SDF, told Reuters that 2,000 hostages kidnapped by ISIS fighters have been released.
"We now have the city in full control, but we are still conducting search operations," Darwish said.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% federal tax
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, showing that her and her husband’s income at the time was $10.75 million and the actual federal tax rate they paid was 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speech fees, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced she earned $3 million from Simon & Schuster publishing company for her book on her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton’s vice presidential candidate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, and his wife, Anne Holton, announced their 10-year tax returns.
The actual federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to provide a model for financial transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
The complete opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and cancels his promises to publish his tax returns.
U.S. presidential candidates have always made their tax returns public, even though they are not required to do so by law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyer have appealed to the IRS for an audit, saying it’s the reason Trump hasn’t released his income data.
“The transfer is yours,” Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams tweeted, referring to the Democratic candidate’s tax records.
On Thursday, Trump’s special counsel Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to disclose his tax records until the inspections were complete.
Critics of Trump, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said his refusal to release information raises questions about Trump’s equity, his contributions to charities, his business relationships, and many other ties, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has addressed this issue and released a video online Friday in which she highlights prominent Republicans who are urging Trump to release his tax returns.
On Thursday, Clinton addressed the issue in a speech on the economy in Michigan.
“Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has been doing for decades, not his public tax returns,” Clinton told the crowd.
According to Politico, Trump paid little or no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist quoted several tax attorneys and auditors on Friday that the situation could still be similar.
Federal tax rates have become a central issue in the presidential election.
Clinton has advocated a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure those who make more than a million dollars a year would pay at least 30 percent tax.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton election rally in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is headquartered in the same location, sued Trump for a meeting where they would both disclose their tax records.
Buffett says he’s also under scrutiny by the IRS and that Trump isn’t afraid of the IRS, he’s afraid of the voters.
The Clinton campaign has been publishing tax returns since 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average of 32 percent of the actual federal tax rate between 2007 and 2014, and the actual combined tax rate they paid was about 40.5%.
The Clintons’ 2015 tax return shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was wage earners.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clintons reported a sum of dividend and interest income of $109,000.

Chili-filled firecracker condoms in support of elephant protection in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania have found an unusual way to keep elephants away from human habitation – elephants are rushed by throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
The method has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the US-based Nature Conservancy, has launched a campaign to teach village volunteers in northern Tanzania how to protect their homes and crops without harming elephants.
Until recently, elephants were being chased by spears.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of animals.
“After developing the method, we have seen attitudes change in these villages, as now villagers can be confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them,” Damian Bell, executive director of the Honeyguide Foundation, said in a statement.
First, the intrusive elephant is disturbed by pointing a flashlight and playing the horn.
If this doesn't work, we'll throw a chili cloud.
The ground chili powder is put into the condom together with the firecracker, after which the end of the condom is screwed so that only the ignition wire is left outside.
When the fuse is ignited, the condom explodes and spreads a fine cloud of chili powder in the air.
Usually, one cloud of spices is enough to drive the elephant away.
The last resort is a toss, which shoots a firework known as a Roman candle into the air and produces a loud and bright explosion.
Jewish film director criticizes Berlin hotel for removing Israeli area code from Arab 'invitation' – RT News
A French Jewish film director gave birth to a media frenzy when he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not mention Israel in its country code list.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Shoah documentary on the Holocaust, vented his frustration with the Kempinski Bristol in Berlin by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
During his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of country codes offered by the hotel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries that can be called directly from the room.
“How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel will be completely destroyed – as if it did not exist?”
Lanzmann writes.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the possibility to call Israel through a separate call center.
The film director asked for an explanation from the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes that the receptionist’s answer shocked him.
The receptionist said that removing Israel from the list was "a carefully considered decision by the Kempinski hotel management."
The reason for the action shocked the filmmaker even more.
According to Lanzmann, the official said: "Most of our guests are Arabs, and they are calling for the removal of the Israeli area code."
Israeli Ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, who was interviewed by the Suddeutsche Zeitung, called the incident "a great shame".
“This incident shocks and shocks us all.
It's a great shame.
And it’s all the more shameful when we consider that we are in Germany and it’s this hotel chain that we are talking about.
No further explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions,” the ambassador said.
The incident caused quite a reaction online, where it was called a scandal.
Some accused Kempinski of simply giving in to the claims of the alleged Arab customers.
“Shame” was said in a publication that highlighted the location of the hotel near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm.
Der Spiegel writes that the hotel quickly denied the charges, called the incident a mistake, and apologized to Lanzmann.
“There was never a direct order to exclude Israel from the area code list,” a spokesman for the Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski said in a statement.
It adds that the area code has since been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets during demonstrations of Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest against reforms of the government’s public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The riots began when law enforcement tried to disperse a group of students, resulting in the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the demonstration to show their dismay at the government’s plans.
The governor of Sao Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, has proposed a austerity measure that will see nearly 100 public schools close and 300,000 students placed in new schools.
Some of the protesters made graffiti on the walls that temporarily opposed Michel Temer.
The student demonstration took place just days after the streets were filled with pro-President Dilma Rousseff protesters as the country’s Senate voted to impeach her.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71% – RT Business
Since the sanctions were lifted, annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9%, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan.
According to him, the interest of Russian companies in doing business in Iran has increased since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran.
"Russian companies will continue existing relations with Iran while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Increasing trade further is, of course, one of the priorities for cooperation between the two countries,” says Dzhagaryan.
He notes that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period in 2015, rising to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5% to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade was boosted by the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Embassy in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
In addition, for the first time, Iran was among the first 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists that its citizens visited in Russia.
And it’s not too risky to say that the record number of Iranian tourists traveling to Russia will be broken this year,” he said.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran, on the other hand, is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend traveling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he says.
Scotland's Callum Skinner wins cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced for fame in the men's team sprint at the Rio Velodrome last night when the British trio defended their 2012 title in London.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow played the anchor role he inherited from his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy, who made the legend proud as he raced to the finish line and beat the favourite New Zealand team.
Britain won the gold medal four years ago when Hoy won his fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after only finishing sixth at the World Track Cycling Championships in London in March, despite Hoy having since left his racing career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, who specialized in the role of first leader.
Hindes showed up at just the right time.
Hoy's decision to end his racing career also left a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
The Scottish Skinner was a man British coaches believed in and where they saw the potential he has now redeemed.
Hindes, Kenny and Skinner, who won the championship with Hoy four years ago, set the Olympic record in qualifying, but in the first round New Zealand was faster.
And the British trio won gold in a duel.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his tour, but Kenny pushed for the team's lead, which Skinner kept.
A big part of the change was to change the strategy so that Hindes drove to slow down the pace at a higher gear, which allowed Kenny, and Skinner in particular, to keep up.
Hoy followed the BBC as a commentator and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they entered the podium.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow says: “I’m flattered by the juxtaposition.
I just want to do my best and be successful.
We set the Olympic record in the finals and won world champions.
It was incredible.
There’s no better way to win it.”
After winning in London in 2012, Hindes, along with Kenny and Hoy, admitted that he had fallen on the track on purpose due to a bad start.
He later withdrew his word, and the British rivals had no recourse.
This time there were no such problems with the sovereign victory.
Hindes says: "The feeling was like in London, all the British flags were flying in the stands.
Our team has been united for the past three months.
We’ve lost so many world championships that winning the Olympics feels great.”
In other words, one race, one gold medal for a country that won seven of the ten track championships in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of the progress made in the last five months, you are looking at a successful five-day velodrome.
As Kenny has shown with his talent, it is not impossible to imagine that he will repeat Hoy’s achievements and win three Olympic gold medals in one Olympics.
This would mean accumulating six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and was also born on March 23 (the magical date of British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
The medals would then be the same as Hoy’s.
Kenny will compete next in the sprint, which starts today and will be resolved in three days.
Twenty-eight-year-old Kenny from Bolton says: “At the moment, I can only rejoice in this.
Team competition is always the best.
You get to enjoy the victory together with your friends.
"Winning alone is a little lonely."
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must be knighted."
This was the only medal race of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest in the four-man team.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record set in London in 2012 was 3:51,659.
The first round and the final (at 22.42) will take place today, the second day of the race, and the focus will certainly be on Wiggins.
Yesterday he had a dispute with the race officials before the qualifying, when the officials invited him to measure his height.
In a similar women’s competition that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavie set a world record of 4:13.260.
The UK team can now count on its great track cycling team to take over the middle of the Olympics and bring a number of medals to the country.
After the truly exceptional demonstrations of full leadership in Beijing and London, expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
There have been dramas behind it, not the least of which is the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid allegations of sexism and bullying, and the end of the racing careers of major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, the races held on the first night on the velodrome show that the already legendary reputation of the UK to rise to the top at the perfect moment is once again realized.
The future of the Portland smelter is at stake due to the termination of the electricity contract
The future of an aluminium smelter in Portland, Victoria, and thus the jobs of thousands of workers, is at stake when a power company supplying the smelter told it that one of the plant's owners is cancelling the supply contract and it is expected that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This follows a decision by the Victorian government earlier this year not to extend the subsidies to keep the plant in operation.
Fixed, 20 years of support will end in November.
As many as 2,000 jobs are at risk of being lost at the Alcoa Portland plant.
Up to 2,000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk as a result of the closures.
The snowball effect may increase further, as the smelter consumes about 10% of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, forcing Anglesea to close its power plant last year.
The Alcoa Portland smelter is losing money and is in danger of closing its doors.
The measures are in line with years of speculation about the future of the plant, first driven by the strong Australian dollar and more recently by the price of production at the plant.
AGL, which supplies electricity to the large aluminium smelter from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says it expects the three other smelter owners to terminate their contracts as well.
The factory is majority-owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, and is owned by CITIC in China and Marubeni Corp in Japan.
The AGL expects the Portland plant to remain operational, which means that physical electricity demand from the smelter will continue.
According to AGL, the agreements are so-called hedging agreements, which were supposed to enter into force in November 2016.
The term of notice for the agreements is 12 months, so they will expire in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL expects the contracts to generate revenue in fiscal year 2017," says the power plant.
The potential return effects for AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by the strong future market outlook for wholesale electricity market prices.
The AGL says it has already reduced the value of its contracts by $187 million in its bookkeeping “in anticipation of termination of contracts.”
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to keep the smelter operational or to secure the supply of electricity to the smelter".
The American company said it had signed a 20-year deal with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to come into effect in November this year, although it still has to explain why it has withdrawn from the deal.
Due to the weak economic situation in the sector, analysts have been cautious about their estimates of both the smelter in Portland, Victoria, and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
In a speech to analysts earlier this week, AGL Chief Operating Officer Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
"If these factories leave the market, it will mean a significant drop in demand in the (electricity) market.
As a producer, this would not be good news for us," says Mikkelsen.
Kardashian reality TV star Kendall as September's Vogue cover girl
A Kardashian-Jenner model and the fourth daughter of her mother and manager Kris, Kendall Jenner, 20, poses for the US Vogue in the famous September issue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder’s advertising face and has performed at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
“Watching the deck in a room full of my loved ones made me cry,” Kendall wrote.
The release of the cover was followed by a strange (or maybe just Kardashian style?) scripted video featuring all the members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (baristas Rob and Caitlyn and everyone’s favorite uncle, Kardashian show producer Ryan Seacrest) pretending to have forgotten their sister’s cover: the video ends with a classic.
The plot is clichéd, and is used in almost every birthday episode of the stage show (Seacrest utters the words, “Did you think we forgot you?” as sincerely as a cartoon character on a children’s morning TV), but Kris had to somehow get her other daughters involved in this publicity.
For appearing in the September issue of Vogue unquestionably marks a new era for the Kardashians.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have gotten to Vogue's cover before (she appeared on the cover of Vogue with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is in a class of its own.
The September issue is Vogue’s best-selling release of the year.
The number resembling a large picture book rather than a fashion magazine attracts a large number of advertisers (fashion site Fashionista calculated that last year’s 832-page opus had 615 pages of ads).
The release of the cover star of the September issue is so eagerly awaited that in the two previous years, images of the magazine have leaked to the public even before the official announcement.
Previously, the cover designs for September have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has featured celebrities who work as models rather than models who are celebrities.
The Oscar-winning and Dior-advertising face Jennifer Lawrence was featured on the cover in 2013, and a year later Lady Gaga was honored.
The magazine describes Jenner as a success model for her generation, and even if she’d rather be one of the celebrities working as a model, she’s still in pretty good company.
These celebrities aren’t relatives of famous people, reality TV stars or modern-day kids who know how to make a good Snapchat video (though Jenner is all of these).
You can rightly call them talented women who are more successful in the entertainment industry than others.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the cover last year, has one of the strongest years of her career, when she released her Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner’s success.
Because of her reality TV background, Jenner’s position in the fashion world will always be precarious.
In June, original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "bitches."
These feelings have resurfaced when news of Jenner's appearance on Vogue's cover surfaced.
However, the constant feeling of dissatisfaction seems irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is the cover model for the September issue of Vogue.
She's a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
She's walking around the Marc Jacobs fashion show.
She's the face of Estee Lauder foundation.
She and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves through paid apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, whom she photographed for LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, he appears on reality TV, perhaps just as a way to meet his sister and her children.
Legal Aid Centers Deport 160,000 People a Year
Every year, more than 160 000 of the country's most vulnerable people are turned away from legal aid centres and the sector is preparing for the impact that further cuts in funding will have on centres that are already on the margins.
In Queensland, three out of five people seeking free legal aid and legal services are already being turned away – the majority of whom are elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unjustified eviction and similar injustices against people without resources.
Public legal aid services, whose workload is already overloaded, are preparing for further cuts in appropriations.
As of June next year, legal aid centers are at risk of losing another 30 percent of federal funding.
According to James Farrell, director of Queensland’s Public Legal Aid Centre, the latest calculation report by the National Association of Legal Aid Centres shows that thousands of people are already being turned away from the centres every year.
If the federal government does not reverse its decision, Farrell says the situation will only get worse.
“Queensland’s public legal aid centers are constantly underfunded, which means that thousands of people are turned away when they seek the essential services they need,” says Farrell.
People leaving violent relationships, people with an unmanageable and crippling debt burden, families separating, workers being made redundant – all of them have legal problems, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The federal government plans to cut funding by 30 percent as of June 2017, meaning that thousands of Queensland’s most vulnerable will have to cope with complex legal problems without assistance.
We appeal to the Chancellor of Justice and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately lift these funding cuts so that people can get the legal aid they need.
Last year, the state government delivered on its promise to bring legal aid funding to the national average.
Now is the time to take into account the needs of public legal aid centres and their clientele, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work."
Donald Trump Campaign Charged With Gun Threatening Employee
New York: A lawsuit was filed against Donald Trump’s campaign after allegedly no action was taken after its leadership was told the campaign’s North Carolina director had threatened an employee with a gun while they were driving a Jeep in February.
The event is described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer for the state campaign.
Bordini said he had waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally before he realized, in his own words, that this was not going to happen.
Bordini says in his lawsuit that campaign manager Earl Phillip “took out a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger and pressed a barrel into Vincent’s kneecap.”
According to the complaint, after filing a complaint with the local and regional management of the campaign, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experienced the same thing as Phillip.
"Even if the weapon is not fired, it will cause damage," Bordini said in his lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after a Republican presidential candidate caused widespread outrage when he told the crowd in North Carolina that “second-party proponents” — who are considered gun owners and gun enthusiasts — could take action if his opponent, Hillary Clinton, wins the election and gets to choose the judges.
Trump’s campaign staff said the media took his words out of context and that Trump’s words did not encourage violence.
In his lawsuit, Bordini seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent conduct and compensation from Phillip for assault, assault and mental harm caused by such conduct.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to the message asking for her comment.
Despite his best efforts, Phillip could not be reached.
Charlotte's local news agency, WCCB, said Phillip had recently left the campaign.
Phillip’s consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, received no immediate response to his call.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must use its Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow is also reviving the economy and creating wealth – not just in local communities and London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the issue that most interested me in Heathrow, and like the London Olympics in 2012, we put a huge amount of effort into making our whole nation and all our regions benefit from them.
The Olympics brought huge benefits to Stratford and the East End.
We will do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10 000 new apprenticeships and 40 000 new jobs, which will eliminate youth unemployment in the vicinity of the airport.
As with the London 2012 Olympics, there are always people who think that the expansion of Heathrow is too big a challenge.
As far as the Olympic Games are concerned, I was told that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will find ourselves in an embarrassing situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow too.
Obstacles will always be overcome, but Heathrow will answer every question asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits not just a few, but many.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs and boost the economy by <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion, bringing skills and employment to both the airport environment and the UK as a whole.
At Heathrow, we have a great team that has delivered on time and within budget an <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment programme that included Terminal T5 – voted the best air terminal of the year for two consecutive years – and Terminal T2 built in the middle of two of the world’s busiest runways.
Now they are ready to produce a third runway backed by a private investment of <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be an extension of Heathrow.
It is time we used the same Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow so that we can guarantee the future of our trade and create skills and jobs that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the chairman of Heathrow's board of directors and the former commercial secretary of the Treasury.
Adblock Plus and Facebook ban ads on cat-mouse play
The efforts of companies that make money from online advertising to distract from ad-blocking software have turned into a cat-and-mouse game, says one blocking software company.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced on its own page that it was blocking ad blockers, Adblock Plus posted a blog post in which it said that users could update their blocker software filters and thus once again block social media ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change the ad tagging codes on its desktop site in a way that makes it harder for ad-blockers to identify which parts of the page are ads.
However, Adblock said it has figured out the new codes.
Ben Williams, a spokesperson for Adblock, wrote in a blog post that "this kind of juggling between the open-source ad-blocking community and scammers has been going on since ad-blocking was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon make its own fix again.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of how much concern ad blockers have become for the industry.
An estimated 200 million people worldwide use ad-blocking software, according to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year, a figure that has nearly quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook is used by 1.03 million active users on mobile devices every day, and mobile advertising already accounts for 84% of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
However, the company plans to focus on misleading ad-blocking apps in its desktop app, saying mobile ad-blocking apps don’t work on Facebook’s mobile apps and Instagram.
The revenue from desktop ads is still high enough, which is why Facebook considered the investment worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook also said it was updating its user preferences ad tool to give users more control over how ads are targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticized Adblock’s new filters, saying they also prevent some regular Facebook posts from showing up.
“This is not a good experience for users, and we’re going to solve the problem,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an email.
"Ad blockers are clumsy and inefficient, and that's why we've been investing in user settings like ad tools so people can control how ads are targeted."
Woman Commits Suicide by Hitting a Car on Swiss Highway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling for the help of witnesses after an accident on the highway in the first hours of Thursday, in which the woman was deliberately run over by several cars.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway in the canton of Vaud near Morges shortly after midnight.
The woman did her desperate deed by lying on a dark road and was hit by several cars, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim, a 49-year-old Swiss woman, was clearly attempting to commit suicide, including a truck.
She died at the scene.
According to the police, many of the drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some have not yet been identified. The police are asking them or other witnesses to report the accident.
Gilles Hofstetter, a lawyer, tells Le Tribune de Geneva that a criminal investigation has been launched, which is a logical step in such a situation.
It remains to be seen, however, whether charges will be brought against the drivers involved in the accident.
"Was it impossible to avoid the collision?
It is up to the prosecutor to find out,” says Hofstetter.
In the last five years, there have been two similar cases in which motorists are not held responsible.
According to the newspaper, in both cases, a person was walking in the dark on the motorway and the court ruled that motorists could not expect to run into a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of charges of manslaughter after she ran into a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had ingested a lot of alcohol and passed out on the road.
The court ruled that the driving behaviour of the police – who were responding to the emergency call – was justified and that the man lying on the road was a “completely exceptional and unforeseen situation”.
Anyone who knows about the accident near Morges on Thursday is asked to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been habitable
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus may have been habitable.
NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model to study Venus’ past using the same tools and algorithms used by climate scientists.
The purpose of the model was to find out whether conditions on Venus were ever similar to those on Earth, even though Venus is hot and waterless on the surface and its atmosphere consists almost entirely of carbon dioxide.
According to the researchers, the slow rate of rotation of Venus is explained by its thick atmosphere.
However, the latest simulation suggests that Venus had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere, and yet it has been spinning slowly.
The model was also used to determine the early surface formation of Venus.
There were probably more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographical variation to sustain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent dimmer.
"With GISS, Venus rotates slowly and has a day side toward the sun for almost two months at a time," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio.
This warms the surface and creates rain, which creates a thick layer of cloud, which acts like an umbrella and protects the surface from much of the sun’s heat.
As a result, average climate temperatures are even a few degrees lower than Earth’s current temperatures.
The model was used to create the story of Venus, which corresponds to earlier assumptions made by planetary scientists about its evolution.
While Venus may have been habitable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for billions of years.
Its oceans evaporated, and ultraviolet light burned the vaporized water.
With the escape of hydrogen into space, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide and a lethal greenhouse effect remained —that is, Venus as it is today.
The researchers reported the results of a new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday from his position as coach of the Colorado Avalanche and vice president of the team’s ice hockey operations, citing a lack of influence in the team’s decision-making.
Colorado Executive Vice President/CEO Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
“For the past three years, I have served as head coach of the Colorado Avalanche and vice president of the team’s hockey operations with vigor, passion and determination,” Roy said in a statement.
“Over the summer, I have thought long and hard about how I could improve the team, give it the necessary depth and raise it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the coach and the club’s vice president of ice hockey operations must be in complete alignment with the organization.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect team performance.
These conditions are not being met at the moment.”
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his investment in the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakic says.
"We are grateful for all he has done for our organization and wish him all the best for the future."
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach of the year for his first season as head coach of Avalanche from 2013 to 2014.
Under his leadership, the team scored 112 points and won the Central Division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and has not reached the relegation period in the past two years.
The Avalanche scored 39-39-4 points in the 2015–16 season and was five points behind the Minnesota Wild for a second Wild Card position in the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goaltender Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career – two for the Montreal Canadiens and two for the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers start negotiations and stop strike
The main negotiators say that the wage strikes of the North Sea oil workers will be interrupted when all parties to the dispute participate in a new round of negotiations.
Strikes have been carried out against Wood Group, a provider of oilfield services, on drilling rigs in the North Sea owned by Royal Dutch Shell.
According to the joint statement of the parties, "Wood Group and the trade unions Unite and RMT confirm that they have agreed to restart the process in order to resolve the dispute".
Starting next week, we will be holding a number of all-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will be dealing with issues from fresh perspectives.
The unions justified their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, in protest at possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group will cut the tariffs of its contractors operating in the North Sea by about 9 per cent this year.
The reduction in the company’s tariffs follows a 10% reduction in the prices of contractors working on land in 20114.
According to the company, the additional cuts will give it the space it needs to cope with the downturn in the market.
Shell, in turn, has cut thousands of employees and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries in an effort to streamline operations following its mega-merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Lower crude oil prices and the economic situation resulting from the UK's decision in June to leave the European Union are putting pressure on energy companies.
Dave Anderson, a Scottish Member of Parliament, met with labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest industrial conflicts in the North Sea for an entire generation.
According to him, the North Sea is vital for the region's economy.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that benefits many, not just a few,” says Anderson.
Less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea in 2016, compared to around $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of stars in the Pleiadian Cluster
The Kepler Space Telescope’s latest mission has been to measure the rotational speed of stars, which has helped astronomers compile the most comprehensive list to date of the rotational speeds of stars in the Pleiades cluster.
With the new data, astronomers will be able to find out why stars in the same cluster rotate at different speeds and how rotation times are related to the planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing the results to other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the star's weight and age, and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis in Pasadena.
The Pleiadian star cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born around 125 million years ago, which means that they are just reaching their adult age.
They are now spinning faster than ever.
When the speed of rotation is at its peak, large amounts of stellar wind are released from growing stars.
These winds have a discriminating effect on stars as they pass through their magnetic fields.
As a star ages, its rotational speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots (corresponding to sunspots).
The latest listed rotational velocity data suggests that larger stars rotate more slowly than smaller ones.
Rebull compares stars to dancers – bigger ones rotate slower than smaller ones.
"We see from the Pleiadian 'dance' that slow-rotating stars are typically larger, while the fastest-rotating stars are typically very light stars," says Rebull.
Because the Pleiadian star cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the properties of stars in relation to their rotational speeds.
"The Pleiadian star cluster provides a support for theoretical models of the rotation of both younger and older stars," says Rebull.
We want to know more about how, when, and why the stars slow down their rotation and stop their “dance.”
Rebull and his colleagues present their latest analysis of Pleiadian rotational speeds in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
