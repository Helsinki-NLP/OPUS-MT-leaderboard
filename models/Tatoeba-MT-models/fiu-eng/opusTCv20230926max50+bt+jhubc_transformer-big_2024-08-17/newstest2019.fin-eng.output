Eemeli Kouki led the Hurricane to home victory in the opening - Savo Volley won another victory
Hurrikaani-Loimaa, who has won the men’s volleyball championship medals seven times in a row, started the 2018-19 season with a home win, when Raisio’s Loimu fell 3-0 on Saturday.
Eemeli Kouki, who returned to Finland from Romania, was the most efficient player in the Hurricane with 22 points.
There were some tunings abroad, but they did not come true, and then came a call from Loimaa.
We were able to get things done pretty quickly, Kouki said.
Like Kouki, Tomi Rumpunen supported Kouki with 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was Samuli Kaislasalo with 17 points.
Winning the opening game is always important.
Many of the players had experience with the other side, and that brought an extra edge to the game.
Our game is not finished yet, but of course the goal is to continue the game," Kouki said.
Määttänen Savo Volley 's
Miro Määttänen was the most efficient in Savo Volley with 18 points, when the team beat the Ducks 3-0 in Vieremä.
Our game was fickle, especially in the offensive end, but luckily we managed to squeeze the victory.
At least I didn’t have any conscious different loading when I was playing against my former team,” Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in 3 series in 2000-01 in Vieremä, scored 12 points.
The head coach, Jukka Tuovinen, was pleased with many things.
The hall was small, so the atmosphere was in the ceiling all the time.
Good vibes from the home opening.
Miro was the king, Sillik played a good game, Tuovinen said.
Siltala's previous season in the league was 2006-07, when he won the silver medal in Pielavesi Sampo with Tuovinen as head coach even then.
Thiago Maciel was the Ducks' most effective with 14 points.
Mikkonen again the star of Akaa-Volley
Joni Mikkonen, who won the league points exchange in 2012-13, has started this season strongly.
The chipper scored 25 points when Akaa-Volley took his first win of the season after defeating the Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has started well on its own.
Today was a close loss, because we lost 17-21 in the fourth round.
We were looking for a win in the round, and the fifth round came at the same time,” Mikkonen said.
The most powerful of the Tigers, who were in the finals a few seasons ago, was the 28-point chipper Edvarts Buivids.
compatriot Aleksandrs Kudryashovs supported with 17 points.
We didn’t get much of a grip on the guy’s chipper, Mikkonen praised.
Finland ranks first in the world in human capital comparison
Finland is a world leader in the comparison of human capital, reports the Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital between 1990 and 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was number one in the statistics.
In 2016, the top five were almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands was ranked one higher, and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan ranked lowest.
When measuring human capital, the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population are examined.
According to the World Bank, human capital is linked to economic growth.
Real Madrid’s Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico in check, local game ended without a goal
Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois went on to defend against the Spanish national team, and the local match ended in a goalless draw late Saturday in the Spanish football league.
Atletico Madrid's Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest to the finish line, but the Belgian guard, Courtois, managed to fight back.
Courtois played three seasons for Atletico when he was a Chelsea player.
Earlier this week, FIFA named him Goalkeeper of the Year.
Gareth Bale scored the best goal in Real, but his shot was missed by the end of the opening half.
Bale stayed on the exchange after a break due to a thigh injury.
According to ESPN, disappointed Real supporters chanted the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, the goalie who moved to Juventus in the match.
U.S. Attacks on Abortion Law: Powerful Documentary Explains Why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to determine whether Brett Kavanaugh, nominated by President Donald Trump, could be elected as one of the nine members of the Supreme Court.
In the Republican Party, many hope that Kavanaugh's decisive vote will reverse the Roe v. Wade decision that made abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary film 'Reversing Roe' - The United States and Abortion Rights tells how the current situation has come about over the years.
Unbelievable as it may seem, the topic is also topical in Finland.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (Sin) has done public work against safe abortion and has received varying degrees of support from the majority of parliamentarians in Finland.
The documentary begins with the gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has become the only abortion doctor in Missouri.
An armed guard at the clinic says he defends religious freedom in the United States.
The news footage reminds us of the deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
There was a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At the time, a coalition of Lutheran clergymen led women to reliable abortion doctors.
The justifications of the pastor interviewed are good, but they are not really needed, a photo of a woman who has died after a self-made abortion is enough.
The number of deaths in the United States was about 5,000 a year.
The legalization of abortion was supported by the Republican Party.
In 1967, California’s abortion law was signed into law by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, it was Reagan, in his presidential campaign in 1980, who began to revolutionaryly confuse religion with politics to get voters.
Her abortion policy was also reversed by her successor, George Bush Sr.
And so did Donald Trump.
To the heart of the matter, the documentary explores the root cause of the politicisation of abortion.
When segregationist religious organizations were denied tax-free status, they became politically active.
Abortion was chosen as a hobbyhorse.
Religion has brought extraordinary knots to politics.
As we write this, we are in a situation where the President, who boasted of sexual harassment but got the votes of the religious right with his abortion campaign, has chosen Kavanaugh, who is now being accused of sexual harassment by several women, as a candidate for the Supreme Court.
Kavanaugh will have the power to determine the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
Israeli army shoots seven Palestinians, including two children, at border
More than 200 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s six months of shooting at protesters in the border zone.
Seven Palestinians were shot by Israeli soldiers in the Gaza Strip on Friday, the Palestinian health ministry said.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, the dead include two children: 12- and 14-year-old boys.
According to the ministry, 505 people have been injured.
Eighty-nine of them were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and launched an airstrike into the border zone after protesters threw stones and explosives at Israeli troops.
The army says it has begun using force to prevent protesters from breaking down the border fence or trying to cross it.
At least 191 Palestinians have been killed in protests in Gaza since March, when Palestinians began weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, 12,000 people are injured.
The protesters demanded that Palestinian families be allowed access to the areas from which Palestinians were forced to leave when the state of Israel was established in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed an Israeli soldier.
Explosives dropped by kites and helium balloons from the Palestinian side have set fire to forested areas and farmland in Israel.
Teemu Pukki got a penalty shot - he couldn't shoot himself
Wigan's top man Chey Dunkley appeared to have knocked him down with a rear tackle in the penalty area.
Referee Gavin Ward allowed the game to go on.
According to his interpretation, the tackle was clean.
Santa Claus couldn’t believe his eyes.
The situation seems to have remained a problem for referee Ward, who sent Norwich on a penalty kick in the 85th minute when Santa was knocked down.
Ward showed a penalty spot, and Mario Vrancic scored a 1-0 win.
Santa has scored five goals for Norwich in the Championship.
The former was born last Saturday against QPR with a stylish pectoral muscle.
Work was good for Santa again.
After losing the ball, he continued until the end.
He created goal situations and defended tirelessly.
Norwich had their fifth game in two weeks.
The team continues in the league cup.
There's a five-win streak in the back.
The pedophile help service was immediately filled with reservations - about 40,000 people in Finland are interested in children
It is estimated that two percent of men and a small percentage of women experience at least some sexual interest in preteens.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
So far, it has been difficult for people who are sexually interested in children or young people to get help.
SeriE, a joint project of the Criminal Welfare Support Foundation and Sexpo, trains professionals to meet paedophiles as clients and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, there was a flood of emails at Sexpo, which offers counselling and therapy, and appointments were booked very quickly, Yle says.
However, they are expected to be released in the autumn.
Sexual preference for children is a source of shame to many.
The majority of those who perceive paedophile feelings in themselves have not fulfilled their fantasies and thus did not do anything criminal.
However, preference is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that distress and discourage them.
They also make normal life more difficult, says Patricia Thesleff, a sexual therapist who works as a specialist in the project.
In my opinion, work is valuable if even one child is spared from sexual violence,” Thesleff said.
The Korean leaders or the Congolese gynecologist?
US President Donald Trump as the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize - the idea may sound strange at first glance, but Trump is one of the biggest favourites for the award, according to betting odds.
The background is Trump’s role in getting North Korea to commit to nuclear disarmament, at least at the level of speeches.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un have met three times this year and promised to seek a peace agreement between their two countries.
The warming between the two Koreas is significant, as they were still frozen last year.
Yet rewarding Kim, who for years has been threatening with nuclear weapons and leading his country with an iron fist, would undoubtedly also be a source of criticism.
The winners of the Nobel Peace Prizes will be announced on Monday, and on Friday, the one that gets the most attention – the Peace Prize – will be announced.
If the prize is not awarded to those involved in diplomacy on the Korean Peninsula, one of the top candidates will be the Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege.
A respected gynecologist has treated thousands of women in his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo for mass rape and has become the world’s leading expert in her field.
Through his work, Mukwege has drawn attention to sexual violence, which is a ghastly byproduct of many conflicts.
The UN Refugee Agency, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, is also considered a strong candidate.
The Nobel Committee has announced that there will be 331 nominees for the award this year.
The names of the candidates will not be made public.
Trump himself would not mind if he won the Nobel Prize.
In May, a reporter asked him at the White House if he thought he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say so myself,” Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
"The prize I want is a victory for the whole world," he said, referring to talks with North Korea.
However, there are some things that make Trump’s Nobel Prize unlikely.
The award-winning Norwegian Nobel Committee has often given recognition to individuals and organisations representing liberal democracy and a multipolar world order – the kind of international cooperation that Trump has been seen to oppose.
In the 21st century, the prize has been awarded to three American politicians, all of whom have been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
Rewarding Trump would require an ideological U-turn from the Nobel Committee.
Fire alarm in the tunnel: Drivers behaved like lemmings and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos on Route 1 in Lohja took place on 8 September.
Due to the announcement, traffic in the tunnel area was cut off in the direction of both Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that it was a system failure, the fire department tried to bring traffic back to normal.
However, it did not succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Centre said that it cannot be opened because there are also drivers on the road and they are driving as it happens,” on-call fireman Pasi Kääriäinen told STT at the time.
At that time, the motorway was even being driven in the wrong direction after just a moment of waiting.
When the first one starts to act against traffic rules, a few others often follow,” says Tapio Heiskanen, Liaison Manager at Liikenneturva.
Traffic rules state that motorways and tunnels must not be stopped except for compelling reasons.
Liikenneturva points out that in exceptional situations, you cannot start endangering traffic with hasty solutions.
Emergency vehicles must always be as unobstructed as possible.
In particular, driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is prohibited, as is making and reversing a U-turn.
The same prohibitions also apply in tunnels where, in addition, the headlights must always be switched on.
Stopping for no reason is also prohibited, as is, of course, parking.
Recently, there have even been cases where a driver has stopped in a tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this action,” Heiskanen said in a statement.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party even if the ship got stuck at the bottom of the lake
The Ilves fans transported by the inland vessel M/S Tampere would have liked to stay on board to continue their victory celebrations, even though the vessel had been stuck to the bottom of the lake, says Juho Syrjä, who was the ship’s master at the time.
M/S Tampere, on its way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drifted off its route late on Saturday evening and got stuck at the bottom of its bow in Vanajavesi, Akaa.
The 19 passengers and five crew members on board were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one was injured in the crash.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party on the ship until the morning, but of course it made more sense to send them by fire service to the harbour and by bus home, Syrjä told STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna to watch the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended in a 4-3 victory.
According to Syrjä, Saturday’s casualty was due to the fact that the water level in Vanajavesi was about half a meter lower than normal.
According to Syrjä, navigation was also made more difficult by the fact that the nearest fairway sign was covered with seagull droppings, which is why its reflectors were not normally visible on a dark autumn bridge.
Not to mention the collision.
The event took place on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalmi strait shortly after the ship route had passed under the bridge of the motorway between Tampere and Helsinki.
According to Syrjä, there was no major drama involved in the incident, as the speed of the ship was very low at the time of the incident and the impact did not cause a more notable collision.
According to Syrjä, the vessel has not suffered any leaks or depressions as a result of being stuck to the bottom, and the cruises continue normally.
The diver checked the condition of the ship on Saturday morning before the ship was towed off the shallows.
As a precaution, we will still visit the shipyard to check that no damage has been caused,” Syrjä says.
Syrjä believes that M/S Tampere’s next cruise booked for next weekend can be arranged as agreed.
According to him, the cruise season will continue until Independence Day.
No use for ambulances
The emergency services received an alert about the incident shortly after 11:30 p.m. on Saturday evening.
Ambulances were called at Viiala harbour to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
On-call fire marshal Matti Willman said late at night that evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult due to the darkness and the rather strong wind.
The Pirkanmaa Rescue Department announced on the night before Sunday that everyone on board had been evacuated and the passengers had been transferred to Tampere by bus.
Built in 1957, the cruiser was restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump’s Accused Harassment and Drunkenness Judge Could Be Missing Out on Top Position
Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court, may well not have the position he is looking for,” says Mika Aaltola, Programme Director at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior during her studies.
According to Aaltola, the suspicions have brought so much political pressure to the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up in the position of someone else.
In the United States, it has happened from time to time in the past that the presidential candidate for Supreme Court Justice has caused a great deal of controversy.
In this case, the judge candidate has usually withdrawn himself, Aaltola says.
In this way, the President has been able to keep his face.
It would rain down on the Democrats.
The U.S. Supreme Court is trying to be above politics, but at least in Kavanaugh’s case, the election of a new judge has become a politically very delicate process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision is likely to rain down on the Democratic Party in the upcoming midterm elections.
It would increase voter turnout among young people and women, who would be more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, appointing a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for Republicans.
The opportunity to be appointed does not occur every term of office, because in the United States Supreme Court judges are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request at the age of 70-80.
Some Republicans are hesitant to call it.
The U.S. Supreme Court nominees are normally subject to background checks,” Aaltola says.
Even though Trump has only set a one-week deadline for further FBI investigations, Aaltola says it can still highlight something essential.
Yes, it might.
Rarely is there smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, what is certain is that Kavanaugh’s suitability or unfitness for office will still be discussed vigorously before the Senate makes its decision.
Republicans have a 51-49 majority in the Senate, but at least two female Republican senators are expected to be skeptical of Kavanaugh's nomination.
The most embarrassing thing would be that the nomination would be put to a vote and the Republicans would lose.
Woman Identifies Salisbury Suspect as Military Intelligence Agent
A Russian woman has told the BBC that she has identified a Russian man suspected of poisoning in Salisbury as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service.
The woman said it was a military intelligence agency working for the GRU, Anatoly Tshepiga.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia said they had previously revealed one of the two suspected poisonings to a man named Tshepiga.
Earlier, they said they had found evidence that the men’s current identities are covert identities.
A BBC team travelled to the Far East to the village where Tshepiga grew up, near the Russian-Chinese border.
A woman in the village identified the young Tshepigan from photos published by Bellingcat.
He identified the same man in British police photos of a man now called Ruslan Boshirov.
The two men are suspected of poisoning ex-double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with Novichok in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded, among other things, the Order of the Hero of Russia in 2014.
Russia denies any connection to the GRU.
In an interview with Russian TV earlier in September, the men suspected of poisoning said they had been in Salisbury as tourists.
Elderly people in health and social care reform
We have now received a living example of what the restriction on changes in the health and social services reform defined by the Sipilä Government means in practice.
Vaala’s health and social services services are provided by the Oulunkaari Joint Municipal Authority, of which Attendo’s former regional director was elected Director of Health Services in 2016.
The mayors warn the council about the change limiter.
If health and social services spending rises now, municipal government subsidies will be cut in the future.
The central decision-makers of the municipality were frightened, and most of them were ready for a major restructuring of elderly care, which would end the institutional care of the inpatient ward of the health centre and the small unit for people with memory disorders.
Home health care would be increased, which means that elderly people living in remote villages would be torn from their roots to be treated "at home" next to the health centre.
Attendo was confident that the municipality would pay for its customers.
The Vaala Left did not swallow bad preparation, but organised a good public event, which attracted a lot of relatives, close-knit nurses and also delegates from other parties.
I presented the regional health and social services preparation with slides on how the municipality of Vaala already treats elderly people most at home in the whole of Northern Ostrobothnia.
The councillor of the neighbouring municipality, Carina Läntinen, was also present.
The local newspaper made a big story about the event, and it again brought the Oulunkaari preparers to their feet.
The health and social services preparers do not write on any paper that Attendo has built a new care home in Vaala, which is now waiting for empty residents.
There are no other service providers.
The draftsmen only talk about the service voucher, but do not say what level of care it will provide or with what kind of staff structure Attendo will provide for elderly people until the end-of-life care.
Without a nurse?
You see, the health centre’s facilities are closed down because there is no doctor’s night stand there.
Attendo will also rely on the doctors at the Vaala Health Centre.
Vaala’s example illustrates how central officials run the delegates with incomplete information and the delegates’ backs are pushed against the wall with a change limiter.
In this way, the Centre Party will empty Vaala’s residents, as who will remain there unsafe to live there voluntarily, if there is an opportunity to move away.
Was it one of the central election slogans that the whole country should be inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan Opens Grand Mosque in Cologne
Thousands of people demonstrated in Cologne, Germany, when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened one of the largest mosques in Europe.
Several hundred people had gathered on the banks of the Rhine River already in the morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read the signs on the protesters, and the slogans condemned fascism.
During Erdogan’s visit, which began on Thursday, several demonstrations have taken place and security measures have been strict.
In Cologne, some 10 000 people were expected to take to the streets in advance to protest, among other things, the human rights situation in Turkey.
Supporters of Erdogan were also gathered near the Grand Mosque.
However, police had isolated a large area of the mosque for security reasons.
In his inaugural address, Erdogan praised the success of his visit to Germany and said it had strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met with Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel vowed on Friday to rebuild relations between the two countries, which have deteriorated significantly since Turkey’s 2016 coup attempt.
Merkel stressed, however, that there are deep differences between the two countries on issues such as human rights.
Criticism surrounds the visit
Both the mayor of Cologne, Henriette Reker, and the prime minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet, cancelled their participation in the opening ceremony as criticism of Erdogan’s visit escalated.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, said he had come from Switzerland to protest Erdogan.
I want to be a voice for those who cannot take to the streets in Turkey.
They have been arrested, killed and subjected.
For Erdogan, anything that deviates from his own thinking is terrorism.
During Erdogan’s last trip to Germany in North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant part of the population is of Turkish origin.
Three indicted in Slovakia over murder of journalist
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
Prosecutors said on Friday three people were charged with the February murders of Kuciak and his fiancée, as well as other crimes.
Earlier this week, police arrested eight people in an investigation into the murder, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot dead in February with his fiancée at his home in Bratislava.
He had studied the links between politicians and the Italian mafia.
Police suspect the murders are linked to Kuciak's investigations.
The case and the article published by Kuciak have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems in the distribution of Karelian on Sunday in sparsely populated areas
Due to a printing error, the Sunday Karjalainen will also have to be mailed unaddressed.
This can be seen in the distribution of the magazine in sparsely populated areas, where the distribution in common boxes has to be done from memory.
The situation was the same for Saturday's paper, and the problem may continue until Monday.
Posting puts extra bundles of leaves in the county.
The newspapers of the subscribers of the rest of Finland will not be mailed separately until Monday.
The delivery of these newspapers is being seriously delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Today, journalist Arto Nyberg will be interviewing Vesa Heila, among others, in his upcoming discussion programme.
Vesa is in the studio to talk about his upcoming space trip, which he booked from Virgin Galactic back in 2010.
The price was 151,000 euros, which required a bank loan.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the departure date has been postponed year by year.
Now, it seems that after an unfortunate test flight in 2014 that also claimed the life of a person, things are in a state of flux.
If all goes well, commercial flights will begin this year or next year at the latest.
Vesa’s flight number is 300, which means that her journey takes place about a year after the first departure.
The flight will take 2.5 hours and be in zero weight for 5 minutes at an altitude of 100 km, a Finnish astronaut says on his website.
At the same address, he also expresses his longing for space.
When I was a kid, I read a comic book called "Space Trip" and saw it on Star Trek television.
We've seen the wars of the stars and that's what I'm talking about...
Yeah, why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a great host.
Manchester City continued their undefeated run in the Premier League after beating Brighton 2-0 on Saturday.
Raheem Sterling and Sergio Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero are the guarantors of the reigning champions’ season’s sixth victory.
Sterling was able to direct his fourth goal of the season from close range to an empty goal when Leroy Sané found him on the 30th minute from the back pole of a Brighton goal.
Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero raised his own goal tally to five when he and Sterling sawed the Brighton defense to pieces in the 65th minute of play.
The Argentine managed to place 2-0 at the penalty spot easily.
City, who started the season with six wins and one draw, leads the Premier League with a catch of 19 points.
However, Liverpool, who played one less game, is just one point away.
Liverpool will face Chelsea in their 7th round match on Saturday.
Youth associations elected new decision-makers in Joensuu
In its meeting that ended on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Association elected new decision-makers for its next three-year term in 2019-2021.
Anu Sivonen from Ylä-Savo was elected as Chairman and Petra Mäkeläinen from Häme as Vice Chairman.
The council elected 40 members and 40 deputies, the Finnish Youth Association will announce on Sunday.
The youth conference was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural activities to be known for quality and safety.
In its three-year operating objectives, the Youth Club Meeting in Joensuu gives three promises: We keep the doors open for everyone, and we organise equal recreational activities regardless of the place of residence and background, and we support voluntary activities and people on their own growth paths, the Finnish Youth Clubs said in a statement.
Lewis Hamilton praises Kimi Räikk<0xC3><0xB6> and surprises Ferrari: "Losing a very important driver"
In an interview with Swiss newspaper Blick, the British driver of the Mercedes was asked if he believed that Kimi Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen’s release from Ferrari would help Hamilton in the rest of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second driver Sebastian Vettel by 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari announced that Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen will not continue in the team next season, and at the same time Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen announced that he would transfer to Sauber.
Hamilton, of course, does not believe that Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen would put gloves on the counter.
I don't think Kimi will change in the remaining races.
He is an exceptional professional - a fantastic driver.
He will remain one of my favourite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Hamilton has previously stated that Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen was one of his first children.
I don’t know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and dreamed of Formula 1, I used to play F1 on PlayStation all day.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy," Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season continues on Sunday with the Russian Grand Prix.
Valtteri Bottas of Mercedes will start the race from pole position at 2 p.m.
The evening newspaper follows the race moment by moment.
The championship of the A-team became a complete farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players
The top tier of football for boys will end on Saturday, when the last round of the season will be played.
Before the round at 13 o’clock, the starting points for the championship were clear: FC Lahti Academy had enough points against Vasa IFK to be in first place.
In order to turn the tide in the final round, Ilves, who is second in the championship battle, must win the PK-35 and hope for the loss of the Lahti people.
However, the Lahti national championship was confirmed even before the start whistle, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
Had there been less than one player, the match would not have started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
During the break, the Gulf people led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the loss of players in Vaasa is that the team has played with the same players in the Finnish championships, i.e. the P20 series of A-juveniles and the men’s C-group of Kakkonen.
Vasa IFK has played in Kakkonen practically against the fall of the season.
In the second round on Saturday, Vasa IFK is forced to win JBK’s away game and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose their own away game against KuFu in Toivala, Siilinjärvi.
The car ended up on its roof in Eno - according to the rescue department, luck was involved
The car ran off the road and ended up on its roof in Eno at Juttuvaarantie on Sunday around 9 a.m.
Four people were involved in the accident.
Two of them were slightly injured, the rescue service reports.
Good luck with that, says the report.
Rescuers said the road was wet from the rain.
A police patrol was at the accident.
Supo is looking for new ways to investigate: Equipment purchases and recruitments have already been made, there are no whispers about planned operations abroad
According to Antti Pelttar, the Head of Supo, preparations for the Intelligence Act have been made by purchasing equipment and training personnel.
When the Intelligence Acts enter into force, an increase of approximately EUR 10 million would be permanently added to the Supo budget.
The Security Police’s (supon) premises on Ratakatu street in Helsinki are already fully prepared for the entry into force of the Intelligence Acts.
Antti Pelttari, the leader of the Supo National Coalition Party, tells Lännen Media that equipment has already been procured for future intelligence powers.
Serena Williams is shocked by the video of her singing topless in a campaign for breast cancer awareness
Tennis superstar Serena Williams is back.
Now she is campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by posting a video on her Instagram account of her singing with only her hands in front of her breasts, according to the news agency AFP.
The song is a 1991 Australian hit by The Divinyls, I Touch Myself.
In the video, Williams supports the Australian Breast Cancer Association.
“I recorded a worldwide hit with The Divinyls to remind women to do regular self-inspections,” Williams wrote in an Instagram post.
And yes, this put me in a discomfort zone, but I wanted to do it because the subject touches all women, regardless of skin color, all over the world.
Early detection is the a and o of everything - it saves the lives of many.
The song was written by Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, created in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
"She died of breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first," Williams said.
The video has now been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was published early Sunday morning.
In the video, Williams is praised for his courage.
Williams left the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
There was a fight at the U.S. Open three weeks ago.
Williams fired on the referee and claimed, among other things, that men are accepted for much more aggressive behavior than female players.
Chinese restaurant on a mountain path is not suitable for height-scared
In addition to traditional Chinese dishes, the restaurant serves wonderful scenery.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in the Chinese province of Zhejiang.
It is literally located on a cliff.
If you want, you can look at the forest below.
The lofty views from above make restaurant guests gasp for breath in the Longquan Mountains.
To get to the restaurant, you need to hike among the peach trees.
The restaurant opened for hikers on 19 September 2018.
YouTube commenters wonder where the bathroom is.
Hiking to the restaurant requires good ground condition, the place is told.
The End of the World Series: This Is How It All Ends
All good things come to an end.
Today this is what happens to the Finnish country drama Korpela alley race, which has been quite popular.
The third season has gone like crazy: last week, 722,000 Finns watched the episode on television for the first time.
The top figures in themselves no longer have any practical meaning, as there is no continuation to Heikki Luoma’s and Jukka Mäkinen’s series.
In the finale, Jaska's and Mirkku's relationship takes another big leap forward, and Jaska's mother is probably the first to guess what is to come.
Anssi and Miisa also have a warm relationship, which is downright romantic in the light of recent events, but then Laiho reappears.
The police are also suspicious of the man.
However, no one can predict the future.
Anita, on the other hand, receives incredible news.
The last will of Kauko is revealed, which brings the woman to the brink of tears.
After a week on Sunday evenings Sorjonen continues with new episodes.
Korpela alley race today on TV1 at 9:05 p.m.
Is it worth it to go to work tomorrow with a small flu?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
Many people choose to stay home or not.
However, it is worth considering whether it is worth infecting others, as the disease can be contagious even if your symptoms are small.
Sometimes the symptoms of the flu suddenly strike, sometimes they appear in the form of creeps.
With the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your own symptoms seem small, says the publication Prevention.
Is it worth staying home?
According to Prevention, the flu is contagious even when the person does not have any symptoms.
The virus is transmitted as early as one day before symptoms begin and from five days to a week.
Children can infect the disease for longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you should not be at school or work.
You can go back to work when the cough goes away and the fever is gone, says Gregory Poland, a professor of medicine.
Training should also be avoided.
Returning to the gym too quickly will slow down recovery.
Be sure to wash your hands, blow on your handkerchief and throw away the paper towels.
Still in pain, though?
If you have to leave your home sick, consider wearing a protective mask.
The mask does not keep viruses under control, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
You don’t put your fingers in your nose or mouth, Poland says.
Sneezing is also limited with the mask.
How can infections be avoided?
The best way is to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, the latter is difficult to avoid.
In the United States, for example, the average person touches their eyes, nose or mouth every 15 to 30 seconds, Poland warns.
New Miss Finland repeats her mission tradition: "My husband is an ice hockey player"
Hockey player and misses are often connected to each other.
This was the case with Alina Voronkova, 23, too.
Alina Voronkova from Pertunmaa has been awarded the 2018 Miss Finland crown.
She now lives in Lahti, where she moved at the age of 15.
Alina’s mother is Ingrian Finn and her father is Russian.
About the Russian father Voronkova was bullied at school.
My mother and father moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied for being Russian.
At Pertunmaa I didn’t have any friends at all,” Alina says at the announcement of the semi-finalists of the Miss Finland competition.
After secondary school, Alina decided to start fresh and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon she found new friends and the everyday life started to roll as well.
At the age of 15, you think you’re an adult, but in retrospect, I wasn’t.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner Joonas Hurri, who is familiar from the Pelicans.
After playing in the Finnish SM-liiga, the ice hockey player has played abroad, such as in Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was on the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Cup.
In the early days of dating, the couple lived almost a year apart, but later Alina was able to travel the world with her husband.
If I were to make it to the winning trio and have a career, I don’t want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we have to live separately, trust works well for us and the good thing about a long-distance relationship is that the initial spark stays on all the time,” Alina grinned in May.
With constant growth, death on our heels
Almost everyone is concerned about the sustainability of the planet.
Yet, there is nothing they want to give up.
Sustainable alternatives to continuous growth are being sought, but even the theory of moderate economy runs into big problems.
The continued growth of the economy has, over the course of a few generations, brought ordinary people, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, a standard of living that was once only dreamt of.
However, the long-term overshoot of the Earth’s carrying capacity and climate change are threateningly swaying the foundations of this market economy.
Two men were stabbed on Sunday night in Kannelmäki at Sitratori at four in the morning.
A man born in 1986 was seriously injured in the stabbing, and another, born in 1968, was more mildly injured.
The older men have already been released from the hospital.
The police have arrested one person whose possible role in the stabbing is being investigated.
Police are also looking for a second suspect.
The events are being investigated as attempted manslaughter and aggravated assault.
Important point for IFK Mariehamn - Inter coach regretted the mistake
IFK Mariehamn’s Simon Silverholt’s handicap against Inter brought the team an important point in the men’s football league on Saturday.
Silverholt finished the match 1-1 in the 78th minute.
Silvelholt made it through the right wing and luckily lifted the ball over goalkeeper Henrik Moisander.
With a guest saber, the Maarianhamnians reached the difference to Turku Palloseura, which is the place of the league qualifier, to two points.
An important goal and a valuable point, summarized Mariehamn’s head coach Peter Lundberg.
Lundberg said, however, that the team did not engage in the kind of fight he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes in the opening period, but luckily the goal from Turku brought us more into the game.
Inter's head coach John Allen said the game was under control, but scoring was again painful.
“One mistake in defense cost us the full score,” Allen said.
We were the best again!
Finland has the most human value in the world
Finland is ranked number one in the comparison of 195 countries.
The study measured the health and education of the population.
Finland is the best country in the world if you measure it with human capital.
Finland ranked first in a survey measuring citizens’ health, education and learning.
The study measured the change in capital from 1990 to 2016.
The study was published by The Lancet.
According to the summary, human capital has a significant impact on how the national economy can grow in the future.
The most serious situation is in Africa.
The countries of the continent took the seven worst places in the comparison.
Niger is behind.
This was first reported by ST.
The magazine showed its under-performance, the venue is not yet sure
Jori Lehterä’s strong under-play came to the fore when his NHL team, the Philadelphia Flyers, played their last practice game before the start of the season.
Philadelphia beat Boston 4-1, and Lehterä pitched Michael Raffl twice to score.
In the last few days, the magazine has been on display due to drug-related suspicions.
MTV reported on Wednesday that Lehterä was one of 23 suspects in a drug ring, some suspected of using drugs and some suspected of selling them.
The newspaper has denied having committed the crime.
The club and the player have discussed the matter, and the NHL is investigating the case.
After the game, Sam Carchidi, a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter who closely follows the Flyers, estimated that Lehterä was part of a group of six attackers, five of whom would get a spot on the NHL team.
According to Carchid, Lehterä was excellent in the practice match.
In the second round, Lehterä beat the puck, pulled the defender and pitched Raffl to the open position.
For the second time, the two teamed up to score at the end of the match.
The Flyers begin the NHL season on October 4 with a away game against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defenseman Urho Vaakanainen is waiting for the team’s head coach to decide if he can join the NHL.
I thought the training camp was good.
I did my best and I can be proud of it.
Now the coaches decide if I can play.
“I think I’m ready for the NHL,” he said in an interview posted on Boston’s Twitter account.
He played against Philadelphia for 19.31 minutes.
With the Boston goal, Tuukka Rask surrendered four times and made 20 saves.
Flyback defender Vili Saarijärvi scored a 1-0 goal for Detroit by defeating Toronto 5-1.
In Calgary, Ilves was bred by defender Juuso Välimäki, but Edmonton defeated Calgary 4-3.
The Oilers rested for example from Jesse Puljujärvi and goalkeeper Mikko Koski.
Aleksander Barkov of Florida played more than 20 minutes and scored in the local game against Tampa Bay.
Tampa won 3-2.
Columbus defender Markus Nutivaara passed his team's consolation goal in the final half when Chicago defeated Columbus 4-1.
With the losers goal Joonas Korpisalo saved 23/27.
More than 180,000 responses to the time survey
Citizens have actively responded to a survey concerning the decision on the future of Finland.
The question of whether Finland should apply permanent winter or summer time has already received more than 180,000 responses.
The survey opened in the Otakantaa.fi service can be answered in less than a couple of weeks.
The respondents were also asked whether Finland should be at the same time as the other Nordic countries, the Baltic States, Central Europe or Western Russia.
World's Strongest Man Loses Dozens of Pounds
In 2017, the world’s most powerful man, Eddie Hall, undergoes a remarkable transformation.
Eddie Hall has long and determinedly sought the title of the strongest man in the world.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 calories of food a day and weighed 200 kilos, according to Mirror magazine.
The shirts were size 5XL.
Hall admitted to doing damage to his body before winning the title.
The human body wasn’t created to be this size, Hall said.
The British won the World’s Strongest Man by all means, and the family man promised to end his career if he won the title.
Hall didn't want her children to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise and was no longer seen at the World’s Strongest Man 2018 in April.
Recently, Hall posted a photo on Instagram, in which she poses in a much slimmer shape than her active career.
Hall writes that her current weight is 169.5 kilograms.
Hall wrote that he now trains aerobically five times a week.
The programme includes boxing, cycling and swimming.
In addition, Hall does four workouts a week in the gym.
This year, the strongest man in the world was Haf<0xC3><0xBE><0xC3><0xB3>r J<0xC3><0xBA>l<0xC3><0xAD>us Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rnsson from the Icelandic TV series Game of Thrones.
The previous Finnish winner is Janne Virtanen, who was number one in 2000.
Restaurant ship M/S Tampere crashed on the rocks in Pyhäjärvi - "Strongly tied to the rocks"
Inland waterway vessel M/S Tampere ran aground late on Friday evening in Akaa in Pyhäjärvi.
The emergency services received an alert about a water traffic accident on Friday evening after 11.30 p.m.
The 30-metre-long vessel M/S Tampere has drifted off the rocks and is firmly attached to its bow on a rock,” said Matti Willman, a fire marshal on duty.
The ship was carrying 19 passengers and five crew members.
Rescuers said the injuries were avoided.
The passengers and almost all the crew have been evacuated to the mainland.
Now they are being transferred by bus to Tampere, the on-call manager Jari Nieminen told STT after 1 a.m.
Ambulances were called to the Port of Viiala to receive evacuated passengers.
The ship that had sailed from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had for some reason drifted off its route west of the narrow Jumusensalmi strait.
Police are investigating the cause of the events.
On-call fire chief Matti Willman said earlier in the evening that the conditions on the lake are difficult due to the darkness and the rather strong wind.
Rescue officials say the ship's fate is unclear.
The ship doesn't seem to be leaking.
After the evacuation, the divers begin to check the situation at the bottom.
Built in 1957, M/S Tampere is now an inland waterway vessel operating as a restaurant ship with a maximum passenger capacity of 180 persons.
There is also a private meeting room on board.
According to the ship’s website, the cruise ship was restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers demand unpaid fees from Robert Helenius
Boxer Robert Helenius's night fight against Erkan Teper is overshadowed by a money dispute.
Ilta-Sanomat reported today on a lawsuit filed by boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and LL.M. Jussi Kokkila, in which Helenius is charged with over 80,000 euros in unpaid manager fees, including default interest.
According to the application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius from 15 April 2014 to 30 January 2015.
We've tried to mediate, but there's no other way.
There has been a clear mandate here, and a lot of work has been done,” Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanomat.
The current manager of Helenius, Markus Sundman, sent a reply to Iltalehti, describing the boxer’s view of the events.
Helenius denies that he is obliged to pay the required amount.
According to her, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services to Helenius in a financially difficult situation and promised to be able to arrange matches and sponsorship income for her.
It was expressly agreed that Helenius would be obliged to pay remuneration only as a percentage of his matches.
Repeatedly it was asserted that Helenius did not have to pay anything, only to receive the income they had arranged.
This is also the standard and only practice in the management of professional athletes.
Salary work has never been agreed upon, and it would have also been absurd in Helenius’s situation,” Sundman explains in his message.
There was never a written agreement.
According to the defendant, Helenius would have wanted to agree on the distribution of income in writing from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman did not get a draft until the end of 2014.
For his part, he found the proposal to be poor and cut off cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius did not fight once in his dealings with Kokkila and Helminen.
A year after the end of the cooperation, Helenius had been assigned an "unidentified but substantial" invoice for the manager's work.
This year, the same claims were made.
Helenius considers Helminen’s and Kokkila’s subsequent operations to be cowardly.
Today, Helenius will meet Erkan Teper, the seventh challenger in the IBF heavyweight division, in Stuttgart.
A Good Man and a Good Journalist
Entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio host and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
Long-time radio presenter and journalist Erkki Pälli died at the age of 83 from incurable liver cancer.
The announcement of the presenter’s death was published on Sunday in Helsingin Sanomat.
The announcement says that Päll died on September 3rd.
Pälli reported the serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen by Ile Vainio, who was saddened by the news of his acquaintance’s fate.
She had already said goodbye on Facebook, Ile Vainio says.
Vainio regards Erkki Päll as a multi-talented talent who became a great journalist.
He remembers Päll being a well-liked person with quick wits and funny things.
I got to know Erkki as a little boy when I first visited Finnlevy when I was 12 years old and started there as a warehouse man.
We met Ernie then.
At the time, he was Finnlevy’s publicist and held various positions,” Ile Vainio recalls.
When I progressed to making records as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was the standard editor at all the parties doing the artist stuff.
He was always knowledgeable and I could see how passionate he was about entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got right on top of his interviewees.
He was a good man and a good journalist.
He was known to many as a respected radio host at Yle, but he also wrote great newspaper articles.
Ernie interviewed me several times.
He was a good talker, he said.
Over the decades, Pälli worked not only as a journalist, but also with the Fazer record label Toivo Kärki.
He worked as a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loiri’s albums.
However, Pälli’s biggest passion was radio work, in which he had his own unique style.
He worked on the radio from the 1960s onwards, and he became known to numerous listeners on Yle’s ether.
Pälli retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Association announced on Saturday that the financial year ended in May showed a profit of approximately EUR 450,000.
The union describes its economic situation as having experienced a "full turn", even though the economy is burdened by "significant debt on the balance sheet".
Executive Director Mika Kulmala praises quick reaction and strict financial discipline.
We reacted to the situation as quickly as possible last autumn, taking adjustment measures.
Careful planning of operations and financial management have been ingrained throughout our organisation, Kulmala says in the release.
We have also succeeded well in partnering and the profit from the World Cups was maximal during the previous competition period.
However, even in the future, cost management must be precise, and at the same time we must constantly look for new financing models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
Dozens of bodies are lying in the backyard of a hospital in the city of Pura on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Only one building separates them from the area where the injured survivors are gathered to assess the need for injuries and care.
Patients are also treated outside for aftershocks.
One of them was Baharuddin, a 52-year-old Palestinian, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
The last time I spoke to him was when he was going to school,” Baharuddin told AFP.
Dwi Haris, who has suffered injuries to his back and arm, was lying in Palu, in the courtyard of an army hospital.
He was at a local hotel with his wife and daughter.
The family was invited to a wedding party.
I must have been crushed under a collapsed wall.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my baby.
I hope they are safe,” Haris told the Associated Press.
Small businesses are being robbed.
At the evacuation center, 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, the mother of a small baby, tried to calm her feverish baby.
He described the atmosphere in the city as tense.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are being looted everywhere, Kusuma said.
Many Pura residents have slept outdoors or in temporary bamboo huts.
Even if the house were somehow up, any aftershocks could destroy it once and for all and bury its inhabitants.
According to the Associated Press, more than half of the prisoners in the prison escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
It is believed that there were about 560 prisoners, so there are probably about 300 fugitives.
Some of the prisoners in Donggala prison have also escaped, reports The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, the inmates became furious and set the prison on fire after the guards told them not to leave in search of their relatives who had been affected by the earthquake and tsunami.
Please note that the airport has been reopened mainly for relief flights.
Among the first landings was a military C-130 transport aircraft, which brought relief supplies.
Commercial flights Please only limited to the airport.
The pilots are forced to land at the airport without the help of air traffic control, as the tower was badly damaged by an earthquake.
Rain sweeps across Finland at night
On the night before Sunday, a long rain area from the west will spread across the whole country, says the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
The rain comes mostly as water, but in central and northern Lapland sleet or snow is expected.
The chilly frosts of the previous night are not going to be repeated, because under the cloud cover the temperatures remain higher.
A cloudy night keeps the lowest temperatures under control.
In the west, we can temporarily visit the frosty side, said on-call meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rain area retreats eastwards during the morning.
In the south and west it is cloudy or partly cloudy.
In the afternoon, temperatures always move up to the height of Oulu by 10-13 degrees.
The beginning of the week will look similar in terms of temperatures in the southern and central parts of the country, but the weather will become more unstable.
Wind and wave warnings are valid in the sea areas.
The actual autumn storms are not expected for the next few days, but otherwise there will be changing weather in the typical autumn.
Autumn is really starting to get on my nerves, Ilkka said.
Miss New York will not be seen on TV.
On IL-TV you can watch the glamour and glitter of the red carpet of Miss Finland.
Iltalehti’s entertainment journalists are broadcasting the Miss Finland final live on IL-TV from Billnäs ironworks.
The broadcast starts at approximately 6:50 p.m.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned on Saturday from among the ten finalists.
The Miss Finland 2018 final will take place at Billnäs ironworks in Raseborg.
Before the finale begins, you can follow the atmosphere live on IL-TV.
The live broadcast starts around 6:30 p.m. and continues for about an hour.
This year’s final has seen a particularly high number of Miss Finland winners from previous years.
They will be represented on the jury by Miss Finland Jonna Ziprus from 1998.
The other members of the jury are Jutta Gustafsberg, a well-being entrepreneur, Nadi Hammouda, a photographer, Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen, CEO of Jounin Kauppa, and Katja Lintunen, a news producer at Seiska.
We were hoping he'd get into college before he went to the pageant.
Russian father Dimitri and Ingrian mother Svetlana believed in their daughter’s success in the Miss Finland final.
The parents of the new Miss Finland Alina Voronkova, Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova, proudly followed their daughter’s first moments with a crown on their heads.
They came to the audience from Pertunmaa and planned to drive back home after the final.
There is a wonderful atmosphere!
We believed in Erika all the time, but half an hour before the result we started to get nervous, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is Ingrian and Dimitri is Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian even though she has lived her whole childhood in Finland.
Svetlana says that when she was little, Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than the career of a miss.
Alina was often told that when she is so pretty, she should become a Miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio host.
Only later did Alina get excited about beauty contests.
Her parents wanted Alina to go to university before participating in the Miss Finland competition.
This happened, and in the end Alina still wanted to do her bachelor’s degree before the pageant.
We asked him last year why he wasn’t attending, but he wanted to finish the class.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition, because she is a healthy example for both young people and adults.
He plays a lot of sports and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be on display, it shows.
Alina’s boyfriend, Joonas Hurri, works in ice hockey in Japan and did not get to Finland to cheer on her lover in the final.
Alina’s parents believe that the relationship between the young people lasts for a year.
Yes, it is meant to be!
Her parents hoped that she would visit soon.
It's been such a long break from visits because of the missiurges.
I miss you, even though you've been texting me.
A young man was killed in a car crash in Lahti, Finland, and three people were arrested by police.
Police say three people have been arrested as a result of the incident.
On Saturday, the Häme police did not comment on the course of events or the possible intention of the overrun, citing the incompleteness of the investigation.
Police also declined to comment on whether the men who were arrested and the man who died in the run-up knew each other.
Further information on the case will be available at the beginning of next week at the earliest.
Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a stay-at-home mom in Finland - an idea for a comic came to my mind: lack of drawing skills did not slow down
The organic h<0xC3><0xB6>mppu started with my husband’s statement, in which he suggested it to the story I had developed as a person, says Sari Piippo, a comics blogger from Espoo, a housewife and a former EU translator.
Sari Piippo says that she was in Brussels as an EU translator dealing with economic and legal matters until, after her fourth child, the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I have enjoyed my stay at home very much.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it occurred to me what to do when even the smallest child started to be big.
Then, in 2014, a comic came into the picture.
Piippo says that he had never dreamed of making a comic, even though he had read Donald Duck, Tintin and Asterix from an early age.
I had been drawing since I was a child, but when these Organic H<0xC3><0xB6>mppä manuscripts started to emerge, the situation changed.
At first, I made a few dozen manuscripts in a drawer.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (born 2000) is a skilled artist, but I didn't get her involved until the summer of 2016, when I donated Viivi with the help of a drawing board.
His enthusiasm lasted about a dozen strips, and then I had to try it myself,” laughs Piippo, who tells me that the drawing board was a great encouragement to him.
A record board is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something done.
I didn’t even try to draw on paper, says Piippo about his relationship with drawing, which he usually does in the evenings.
Scripts pop into my mind all the time, but I usually don’t make them all at once.
It takes up to several hours for a three-screen strip.
I can make a screen at a time and I like to play with colors.
It’s always the hardest thing to start drawing, because drawing is not my strong suit.
Sari Piippo says that she appreciates Dilbert by Scott Adams among others.
The L-theme features a carrot-bodied mother with a salad-hair fluff.
The other characters are Man, Pissis and Gemini.
In an organic world, people are what they eat.
The ideas of the series come from my own life and from social media.
Sari Piippo doesn’t want to preach or offer a forced snack, even though the Organic hoopla sometimes pushes the issue.
Piippo says he is reading his series with his husband and children.
It’s such a great feeling when you look at the comic you’ve drawn and realize that this is what I’ve done today.
And enough challenges for a housewife!

The lottery's million-dollar jackpot was blown up - these were the real numbers
No results were found for the 39/2018 draw.
The biggest wins of the evening were seen in Saturday-Jokeri, which brought 20,000 euros to Vantaa and Vaasa.
Next week, the jackpot will be €3.6 million.
Saturday's Joker scored two 6s.
Another €20,000 win will go to Vantaa for the winner of the S-Market Tikkurila Veikkaus card.
The other was caught by an online gambler.
Indonesia earthquake: Air traffic controller sacrificed himself - did not leave a cracking tower until he got hundreds of passengers to safety
Indonesia’s earthquake hero is 21-year-old air traffic controller Anthony Gunawan Agung.
Agung remained alone in the control tower until he was able to safely escort a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people from an earthquake-ravaged island.
The young man was on duty at the air traffic control of the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in the city of Pura, when the earthquake struck on Friday.
While others escaped from the control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat until he was able to direct Batik Air's passenger plane from the runway into the air.
This could have saved hundreds of lives, the Indonesian aviation authority told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The control tower shook and cracked.
Eventually, Agung tried to escape by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg was broken and he suffered serious internal injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was supposed to be transported by helicopter to a better-equipped facility, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, an aviation official told The Jakarta Post.
The quake continued to intensify as the flight took off, and was eventually measured at 7.5 magnitude.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian aviation administration has respected Agung’s heroism on social media.
Rehn on Europe’s trade war: “We need to look at the next tweet”
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy.
Growth forecasts have been calculated all over Europe, and the Bank of Finland has also slightly lowered its own economic growth estimates.
President and CEO Olli Rehn said on Yle’s first morning that while the tightening tension will not have a direct impact on European trade flows, it will weaken confidence, which in turn will be reflected in companies’ investment decisions.
The situation also applies to the export of Finnish companies.
For the time being, Mr Rehn believes that Europe is well worth its while.
It has been able to build a truce with the United States and, for its part, to calm the situation with China and Japan.
In Rehn's view, Europe does not seem to be grinding at the feet of a trade war.
I'll have to watch the next tweet and then evaluate it.
“We have a pretty unpredictable partner in the direction of Washington,” he said in an interview with Yle.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and in the Western world as a whole.
The market reacted harshly yesterday to the clearly deficit budget presented by the Italian Government on Thursday evening.
Next year's deficit will be more than 2.4 per cent of GDP.
Mr Rehn expressed concern about the situation in Italy.
Five per cent of the country's loan stock is problem loans and non-performing loans account for more than ten per cent.
In addition, its public finances are in a weak position and the country appears to be once again exceeding its commitment to its European partners.
Perhaps it is not worth painting yet more crises, Rehn replied when asked if Italy is taking Europe into a new economic crisis.
Another issue that will affect Europe is the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
Rehn hoped that it would be in harmony.
A contentious separation would have far more negative effects.
Rehn started as Governor of the Bank of Finland in July.
The President of the European Central Bank (ECB), Mario Draghi, will resign in just over a year.
The conversation with his successor has begun.
Both Rehn’s and his predecessor Erkki Liikanen’s name has been flashed in the speeches.
I don’t think it would be a problem if Finnish names were included,” Rehn said, adding that he would not comment further on the matter.
HS’s super popular Black Box shows continue next week - last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black Box shows organized by Helsingin Sanomat will continue again this week.
Other performances will take place at the National Theatre on 2, 8 and 11 October.
October 23 – The Black Box visits Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets for the National Theatre for sale.
The Tampere show is sold out.
Tickets are sold at Lippu.fi.
During the evening, the journalists and photographers on stage will tell a true story that they have prepared for a long time and that has not been published in any HS media before.
Once again, there is something that no one has ever heard.
"There is a strange spy in the night of Helsinki, an impressive reportage from the other side of the globe and an eloquent story about a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the performance, the audience will have the opportunity to meet HS’s journalists and photographers and continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has been organising live journalism evenings for three years.
They have been popular from the beginning and often sold out.
More than 15,000 people have already been to the show.
The Black Box was awarded at the Bonnier Awards for Journalism of the Year.
The winners praised the new way of doing journalism and the journalists’ willingness to come close to their readers.
Spring 2019 The Black Box will be seen at the National Theatre in March-April.
The performance will also visit Tampere and Turku.
The performance we will see at that time has a different content than in this autumn’s evenings.
Missing mushroom picker found thanks to ‘unprecedented experiment’
The Finnish police’s drone expertise is among the top in the world: “We are asked for trainings”
According to the headmaster of the Police University of Applied Sciences, the police can use drones in addition to searching for missing persons, for example, in crime scene investigations and intelligence missions.
On Tuesday, the Oulu police managed to find the missing mushroom picker in Raahe with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, the headmaster of the Police University of Applied Sciences, tweeted about the incident, mentioning, among other things, that “through unprejudiced experimentation and effective training, we are among the best in the world here, too.”
The drone is a fairly new piece of equipment and an even newer one on police duty.
There are no statistics that the Finnish police are the masters of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case.
This has become clear, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported in international events.
There is tremendous interest in it elsewhere, Himberg says.
It would be hard for visitors to watch the drone activity of the Finnish police.
We are asked for training.
Increasingly widespread
Himberg points out that it is very important to find what has disappeared in Finland’s winter conditions as soon as possible.
As mentioned, in the case of Raahe, the stray was found with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, they are to be further trained.
Drones are already widely used in police work, and their use will become more common and widespread in the future.
This is what I would say, Himberg says.
According to Himberg, in addition to searching for missing persons, the police can use drones, for example, in accident or crime scene investigations and in certain types of intelligence operations.
For example, it is already necessary to visit an area a little further away, where there is a possibility of encountering violence.
The drone can then be used for pre-interview.
Karelian Rugby was promoted to the first division
Karelian Rugby celebrated a 2-division victory in Kuopio on Saturday.
The Joensuuns were still in the middle of the match with a 7-12 loss to Helsinki Rugby Club, but found a plot in the second period and greeted the southern guests 26-12.
At the same time, the 2-division championship meant a historic rise for Karelian Rugby into the 1-division.
The club has previously played in the first division, but at that time the Finnish rugby league was divided into two levels, the Finnish championship and several division 1.
The club is going to take a place in the series, but that means a lot of work for next winter.
The current roster of just under 20 players needs to be raised to 25.
The 1st division also knows the increase in the number of games and longer gaming distances, so fundraising must also be in line with this.
Kotkaniemi starts season in Montreal, confirms head coach
Claude Julien, head coach of the Montreal Canadiens, confirmed on the club's Twitter account that Finnish forward Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal picked up the super promise of Kotkaniemi, 18, in the first round with number three in the summer draft.
The striker joined Montreal's training strength in late summer and has shown strong grip in the September training games.
Kotkaniemi managed to score a goal in his first practice match.
The head coach Julien praised the Finn for taking big steps after arriving at the newcomer camp.
The NHL regular season starts on Thursday night.
Montreal will face the Toronto Maple Leafs.
What is a good leader?
There has been a lot of talk about leadership this week.
Risto Siilasmaa, Chairman of Nokia’s Board of Directors, told HS in an interview about his book Paranoid Optimist, in which he sheds light on his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticizes the leadership of his predecessor Jorma Ollila.
Ollila vehemently denied the accusations, but previous Nokia reports have also spoken of managers’ inability to function as a team; fear and not speaking out, which partly caused the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The company’s ability to take risks and agility during the upswing disappeared.
During the week, the Nordic Business Forum, a major business event, was also held in Helsinki, drawing the cream of Finnish business life to the Messukeskus.
In addition to Barack Obama, there were 12 business stars.
Talking about good leadership was enough.
Leadership legend Gary Hamel said that a good leader should have the courage to take the company into the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most emotionally tied to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, founder of Whole Foods, a chain of stores known for its wide range of organic products, said that a manager should be able to communicate the company’s purpose to the entire staff.
And that purpose cannot be limited to making a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, author of the bestselling book on introverts, said that the most successful leaders are humble.
They act calmly, quietly and purposefully.
They are often introverts.
Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance, pointed out that the qualities of a good leader must coincide with the life cycle of a company.
In the early stages of a company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the company’s future is based.
A company that has grown to maturity needs a leader who knows the numbers.
These lessons were listened to by 7,500 visitors at the Nordic Business Forum – mainly Finnish leaders.
They were at risk of information overload.
It takes a lot from a good leader.
That’s why leadership often goes wrong, even at the highest level.
Siilasmaa and Ollila were also present.
They talked to each other in a friendly manner.
But I don’t think they were the right bosses at the right time.
And their humility was not easy to judge from the outside.
Sara Chafak arrives on a gorgeous red carpet straight from Los Angeles – spends most of her year abroad
Model Sara Chafak arrived to the Missifinals in a gorgeous black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finland dress also had a lace train.
A little bit of jet lag.
I'm back from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there, Chafak says.
Chafak says he's auditioning in L.A.
Among other things, he has done advertising.
He describes his work in the United States as interesting, and also similar to that in Finland.
However, according to him, the work has to be done even harder, because there is always a replacement for the model’s work.
“You have to push harder and be aggressive,” Chafak said.
Choreographer Sonya Lindfors receives €30,000 live art award in Kuopio
Artist Sonya Lindfors won a €30,000 cultural prize in Kuopio on Saturday.
Winner of the Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art, Lindfors works with choreography, community activism and teaching.
Sonya Lindfors’ art is vital to her surroundings.
His work gives others the opportunity to work and create spaces for dialogue in environments they have previously lacked, the jury described as the winner.
In addition to Finnish Lindfors, a number of international artists were nominated for the award.
The prize is awarded annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group working in the field of live art.
Danish police find Volvo wanted in operation: “We can’t tell you where”
A large-scale search by the Danish police has yielded results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed on the <0xC3><0x98>resund and Great Belt bridges.
All land and ferry traffic from the island of Själland was closed to Sweden, Germany and the rest of Denmark.
Police are searching for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS has reached the shift manager of the Copenhagen Police Media Centre.
The car we were looking for was found.
We can’t tell you where the car was found yet,” Henrik Storm, a Copenhagen police spokesman, told Ilta-Sanomat.
According to Storm, the wanted black Volvo has no direct connection to the threat.
He says the greatest danger is over.
The Danish Extra Bladet spoke about the police’s press conference on Saturday.
Investigator J<0xC3><0xB8>rgen Bergen Skov was silent about the operation.
He didn't want to tell me what the name of the crime was.
Skov said it was a "serious crime".
It was a threat to people’s lives.
Three people have been sought in the operation.
Police have not said whether they have been arrested.
According to the newspaper, the restrictions on ferry traffic have been lifted.
Police in Copenhagen also followed the incident on their Twitter account.
However, according to the police, the general public no longer has cause for concern, as the threat was directed at certain people.
Macedonia’s name has caused decades of dissension – now the people are voting in disputed elections
Macedonia, in the Balkans, is currently voting on a proposal for a new name for the country.
According to the agreement between the Macedonian and Greek governments, the country would be called the Republic of North Macedonia.
Until now, Greece has vetoed Macedonia's bid to join NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The referendum question does not mention a new name, but asks whether the voter is in favour of Macedonia's accession to the EU and NATO by accepting the agreement.
The vote began slowly, at least at a school in the centre of the capital, Skopje.
Retired nurse Olivera Argirosvka, who voted at the school, expressed her support for the agreement.
The referendum will mean a change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
This is a big change, especially for young people, he said.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), which became independent in 1991, is the official name of the country.
The government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has campaigned for the agreement.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, there is a lot of tension over whether the turnout will exceed the required 50%.
The referendum is not binding, but a yes vote would give a mandate to change the constitution.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament is needed to amend the Constitution.
The Greek parliament has yet to approve the agreement.
The polling stations close at 8 p.m. Finnish time.
What a great victory!
Robert Helenius knocks out Erkan Teper
Robert Helenius met Erkan Teper late Saturday night in a heavyweight boxing match in Germany.
The 34-year-old Finn took on his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch near Stuttgart.
The main event of the evening was the IBF Intercontinental Heavyweight title match.
The winner of the competition may have the opportunity to take on tougher tasks of considerable economic importance after seeing them on Saturday.
Helenius decided the match in the eighth round, when he knocked out Teper with his hard left hand.
Teper was no longer able to get up from the floor.
"Nordic Nightmare" hurt his opponent already in the third round, when the German's nose began to bleed.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They were due to fight in December 2015.
Teper appealed to the injury and withdrew from the match.
It was then discovered that the German had been doped twice in a doping test.
Helenius has won 28 matches in his professional career and suffered two losses.
A clear favourite, Teper has won 19 professional matches in his career and lost three times.
Hamilton to win with team order - difference to Vettel already 50 points
The Formula One title was once again approaching confirmation, as Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton won the Russian GP and stretched his World Championship lead to Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel to 50 points (306-256).
There are only five races left.
Valtteri Bottas, who left the pole position, finished second.
Bottas, who won his first race in Sochi last year, held the top spot near the middle of the race, but Mercedes told Bottas to let Hamilton pass.
Vettel finished third, Ferrari's Kimi Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen fourth.
Red Bull's Max Verstappen was fifth.
The two assaulted a young man in Joensuu and were caught one block away.
Two men beat and kicked a 31-year-old Jukaalisme man in Joensuu at Siltakatu 12 on Saturday after 6 p.m.
Police said the men also seized the victim’s phone.
Police caught up with the suspects, a 35-year-old man with grass water and a 39-year-old man from Ilomantsi, shortly after the incident.
They were arrested on suspicion of robbery, police said.
The victim suffered injuries that did not require a visit to the doctor.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk will step down as chairman of the company’s board of directors.
Musk has reached an agreement with U.S. authorities.
At the same time, Musk has been fined $20 million for tweeting that he would have secured the funding to pull Tesla off the stock exchange.
The SEC has accused Musk of securities fraud.
Musk will continue to serve as Tesla’s CEO, but the company will also have to pay a fine of €20 million if an agreement between the authorities and Musk is confirmed in court.
Canada is fighting against time to reach an agreement on NAFTA with the US
Time is running out in the negotiations between the United States and Canada on a free trade agreement for NAFTA.
The U.S. has set a deadline of Sunday, and negotiators from the two countries have debated closely throughout the weekend.
Canada’s chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed her speech to the UN General Assembly to focus on trade talks.
At the request of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago to reform the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The U.S. and Mexico want to put the agreement into effect before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won Mexico’s presidential election, takes office in early December.
Trump has said that Canada’s participation in the deal is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that there are plans to sign the agreement at the end of November – whether Canada is involved or not.
In view of these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday, so that the United States Congress has enough time to assess it.
Neighbor Thinks Candles Are Burning in a Firehouse, Fire Department Is Called
Candles burned in an apartment in Kaakkuri, Oulu, caused a fire alarm the night before Sunday.
A dozen rescue services units were called in because of a possible apartment fire.
It turned out that the candles burning in the sauna in the apartment building had looked like a fire in the opposite house, which is why the emergency services had been notified of the matter.
There was no fire at the site.
Police arrest 11 people after Honka-HJK match at airport and metro station
The police arrested eleven people after the Honka-HJK match in the men’s football league in Espoo on Saturday, Länsi-Uusimaa Police Department’s Detective Inspector Teemu Värtinen confirmed to the Finnish Police Service.
The reason for the arrest was protection from crime and disturbance.
Those arrested were released after the situation had calmed down, Värtinen said.
He told me about the evening news earlier.
The match ended 0-0.
After the final whistle, a large crowd of spectators rushed to the field from the stands reserved for HJK supporters.
The situation led to pushing and fistfights between the supporters of the teams.
For example, police officers were needed to end the situation.
In addition to the field, rioting took place in the area of a nearby metro station, where some of the arrests also took place.
I wasn’t there, but what I saw in the pictures was an unpleasant situation,” Värtinen said referring to the brawl on the field.
According to Värtinen, no crime has been reported as a result of the events.
Laukkanen also swam to the final of the World Cup.
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku P<0xC3><0xB6>ytäkivi have advanced to the finals on the closing day of the swimming World Cup 3/7 in the Netherlands.
You can swim in Eindhoven on a short course.
Table Stone of HSS beat Finland’s record in the 50-meter butterfly, where he was second in the first round in 22.82.
Earlier in September, P<0xC3><0xB6>ytäkivi swam in Helsinki during SE 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen from Cetus in Espoo was 24th in butterfly 24,68.
Swimming Club Vuokatti's Laukkanen was sixth in the 50m breaststroke in 30.48 and advanced to the final.
Laukkanen was 15th in the first round of the two hundred metres mixing in 2.14.25.
Students play a rare delicacy: the tragedy of antiquity - the simplified Oresteia is influenced by its visuality
Ancient tragedies are a rare treat on Finnish stages.
For example, the National Theatre last saw the tragedy of antiquity, Sophocles’ Filoktetes, in 1988.
Now the Theatre Academy brought the only complete trilogy of plays from antiquity, the Oresteia of Aeschylus, to the tour starting from the National Theatre.
The Theatre Academy’s acting students work together with a professional director internationally in the Open Stages! projects, which began in 2015.
This fourth project, like the first one, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
The international premiere of Oresteia took place in Berlin in April.
Roiha’s adaptation of Oresteia summarizes the story of the end of the blood feud of the doomed Atreus family and the birth of the rule of law, with merit, in an hour and twenty minutes, especially by intensifying the choir parts.
The work succeeds in being very faithful to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsuur’s fine Finnish translation (2003).
Dramatic lights and a display that reveals the sides of the theatre space accentuate the simplicity and clarity of stage thinking.
At its core is the dynamics between the performers who break away from the chorus and those who play the title roles, and the chorus.
The performance uses both double and triple interpretations of the title roles.
The actors do not leave the stage at all, so, for example, the murders of Agamemnon, returning from the Trojan War, and his spoils of war, Cassandra, are also shown on stage, contrary to the ancient performance tradition.
Of course, the performance does not emphasize its loyalty to the ancient performance tradition.
Rather, a modern interpretation faithful to the text is created in front of the viewer’s eyes, which is constantly aware of its ritual-like roots.
Roiha has managed to bring out the rhythmic group appearing as a close-knit group, almost as one organism, from the stage acting students.
Especially in the choral sections, the actors, who are flexible enough to express themselves in sculptural group formations, are able to perform their best only on the stage, bare, decorated only with a white curtain.
That's impressive.
Oresteia’s performance tour continues to Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer manufactures its first hydrogen truck
The novelty is starting to be visible in Europe, especially thanks to the cooperation agreement with Hyundai and the Swiss company H2 Energy.
According to the cooperation agreement announced at the IAA Commercial Vehicles Exhibition in Hannover, Hyundai will deliver a batch of 1,000 vehicles to the Swiss company and its partners.
With the launch of the fuel cell-powered truck, Hyundai continues to drive the ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell as a hydrogen vehicle manufacturer.
With this first project of its kind in the world, we are taking fuel cell technology even further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market for these vehicles by, for example, following the development of the refueling network,” said Hyundai Motor Vice President In Cheol Lee at the announcement of the agreement.
His fists swayed several times in Kajaani
A man in his early thirties assaulted three men in a restaurant in the centre of Kajaani and in front of it on Saturday morning.
The man first hit a man inside the restaurant, and as a result, he was removed from the scene.
Outside, he pushed another man into the ground, and when a third man intervened, the abuser hit him too.
The police arrested the abuser.
At the police station, the man continued to act aggressively and kicked another police officer in the leg.
He also threatened to assault and kill the police.
He was taken to the jail to calm down.
The case is being investigated as three assaults and a violent protest against an official.
There was also another assault in the centre of Kajaani in Välikatu on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, a 20-year-old male from Kajaani hit the victim.
A little later, another man knocked her down, and the man who had hit her before kicked her.
Outsiders pulled the attackers away from the victim and the police were called.
They were able to leave before the police arrived.
The police ask the witnesses to the incident to contact the Kajaani police by phone at 0295 416 520 or by e-mail at kirjoittaja.kainuu<0x40>poliisi.fi.
Long-time radio host Erkki Pälli has died.
Erkki Pälli, a long-time journalist at Yle, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio host Erkki Pälli, 83, has died.
He died of terminal liver cancer, which he shared on his Facebook page in March 2018.
We're on our way.
The doctor has said it, I live one day at a time, he commented on his situation to Iltalehti a month ago.
The security of the store’s aunts and uncles must be guaranteed
The first time I got paid for a newspaper article was in 1984.
When a topic of conversation surprises you with these rings of years, it’s usually big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27 September) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was surprised and at times even a little angry.
I also spoke to Erika Kähärä, a workplace expert at the Finnish Service Union (PAM).
He says the crime statistics don't tell the real story.
The problem is growing, although employers of course claim otherwise.
Only cases that are clearly perceived as serious are reported to the police, and many actual violence situations go unreported.
"Companies are of course obliged to compile near-miss statistics under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, but these statistics will remain for internal use and their data will not be collected anywhere," he said.
Injuries do not end up in statistics.
The problem with violence has always been that it does not always result in physical injury.
Despite this, psychological trauma can be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between a situation of violence and a threatening situation is difficult to draw when even aggressive threats of a certain level have to be counted as violence - even if there is no assault.
Too many people are afraid in their workplace, even if the actual act does not happen.
Some residential areas are unsettled.
The store's got guards.
When the opening hours of the stores were released, the media was also quite baffled by its impact on the security of sellers.
“At that time, quite a few employers organised security guard services at least for night-time hours and to prevent working alone,” Kähärä comments.
When nothing happens, we come to the wrong conclusion.
This now seems to have had an effective effect, but this produces a new negative trend.
When security kept the incidents well under control, it gave the impression that security would be unnecessary.
There are now many attempts to find solutions that could eliminate expensive security services.
Mild assault is a crime for the plaintiff, and it is quite understandable that an assaulted seller does not want to make an investigation request about a criminal who usually lives near the store.
But according to the same paragraph of the law, which was enacted in 2011, mild assault becomes subject to the prosecution, if it takes place in the workplace.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time an aunt or uncle in a shop is abused, the police should investigate and the prosecutor should prosecute.
When the courts put a few abusers in jail, and sentencing from the harsh end of the penalty scale, the manners would become more tidy.
A society in which the grocery store must be open even in small towns almost day and night must guarantee the safety of the workers in the store.
Heidi Sohlberg signed off to the miss before the live broadcast - "Sara, Iiro is then married"
The crowning of the Miss this year will not be seen on TV as usual, but the broadcast will be shown on the Viafree website.
The show will be hosted by former Miss Suomi Heidi Sohlberg and the host of Viasat and Viaplay’s NHL and KHL studios Iiro Harjula.
Backstage and red carpet is hosted by Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the three presenters told the invited guests and media representatives about the progress of the broadcast.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a resounding round of applause.
Now all the women scream!
Look at this male presenter of ours,” Sohlberg praised his colleagues as the audience cheered.
Many of the leading women's competitions will be followed by Miss Finland from previous years.
Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sat next to each other and Sohlberg threw a little joke in either direction.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg shrugged, looking at Sarai.
The more likely it was that Sohlberg was referring to the recently divorced Siepp, who laughed at the comment even though he looked confused at first.
He spoke for the first time about his divorce in the newspaper Ilta-Sanomat.
Missikaunoita told that she does not want to explain the reasons for the divorce in more detail in public, because it is a matter between her and Scrooge Salminen.
He said he’s not in a hurry to get into a new relationship, he’s going to focus on himself.
I focus on my own things and especially I start to live my own life alone,” Sara Sieppi said.
Harjula’s marital status came to light at a later stage, when Sohlberg mistakenly called Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The hostess laughed at the mistake.
Iiro was married or what?
Janni Hussi made a mistake.
A man from Ostrobothnia tortured his married partner by cutting, burning and feeding strong sauce
The Ostrobothnian District Court has sentenced a 34-year-old man who lived in Kokkola to three years in prison for numerous crimes against his cohabiting partner.
The means of committing the crime included a belt, cable and cable ties.
The court condemned the property as lost to the state.
Mr. Rank's indictment was for aggravated rape.
However, this charge was dismissed by the district court.
Kokkola was accused of four assaults, aggravated assault, coercion, unlawful threats, deprivation of liberty, severe deprivation of liberty and two acts of harm.
The crimes took place between March 26 and May 24.
At the end of the incident, the man was arrested and arrested a few days later.
On Thursday, the Ostrobothnian District Court handed down its judgment and ordered the 34-year-old to remain in Vaasa Prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also charged with two counts of aggravated deprivation of liberty and aggravated rape on May 22.
However, these charges were dismissed as unsubstantiated by the court.
The case was tried in court behind closed doors.
The judge, however, made a public statement on the verdict.
According to the district judge, the accused had directed violence, threats and coercion against his spouse in situations where he had been tied up.
The accused cut his victim with a knife, smoked with a cigarette, fed strong sauce and poured water and coffee on top of him.
By his sentence, the court ordered the state to confiscate the means of crime: a belt and cable, cable ties, a bathrobe belt, a knife and a visor.
The Four Witnesses
According to the district court, the parties continued to live together between their actions.
It is clear from the sentence that a large proportion of the most egregious acts took place at the end of the period.
Four witnesses, two women and two men, were heard in court.
A 34-year-old victim must pay compensation for pain, suffering, suffering and temporary harm totalling EUR 5,800.
I doubt he has that kind of money, as the convicted person already has debts to collect.
The prison sentence is not the man’s first.
It does not give the name of the accused to protect the victim’s privacy.
A recent court ruling is not final at the time of writing.
Europe leads by four points for Ryder Cup
On Saturday, European golfers captured their lead in a traditional match against the United States.
Europe is leading the Ryder Cup in Paris with a score of 10 to 6, with 12 games still to be played on Sunday.
Europe won three out of four of Saturday’s four-ball matches, and in the afternoon’s doubles match, the winnings were tied 2-2.
The European leaders were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four of their doubles matches on Friday and Saturday.
Never before had a European couple achieved anything like this.
On Sunday, the two are looking for more history.
No European player has ever won five points in a Ryder Cup, and no American has ever won more than three: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns its supporters' violent harassment in Honka match: "Violence is not part of football"
The HJK football league team released a statement on Sunday condemning the disruptive behaviour of its supporters in Saturday’s FC Honka match in Tapiola.
“We regret the events following the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters,” the statement said.
At the end of the match, about 50 supporters of HJK rushed to the field and some seemed to be trying to challenge the supporters of Honka.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
Police officers were not able to calm the situation, and police officers were needed.
HJK said in a statement that the team’s players and officials are shocked by what has happened.
The events after the match are not in line with the values of our traditional 111-year-old club.
“We strongly disassociate ourselves from any activity that endangers the safety of matches,” the statement said.
HJK promises to help the authorities and the organisers of the event to identify security threats and eliminate side effects.
Supporter culture is a part of football and an important issue for HJK.
We strongly support positive, joyful and encouraging activities in football stands.
“Violence is not part of it,” the statement said.
Filipino Inventor Flying in Drone Car – This Is How To Avoid Traffic Congestion
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Peloton.
He’s now one of a growing group of people around the world who swear they’ve invented a flying car — or at least a version of it.
As a competitor, he has, for example, Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in the mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from around the world, he has spent a large part of his fortune building his dream.
He started developing his flying car six years ago.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made the first successful test flight - he glided on his device at an altitude of more than seven meters.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope that the device will provoke positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said, according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL anticipates: Industrial action starting tomorrow will be visible in children’s day care and social and health services
The prohibitions on overtime work and shift changes starting tomorrow in the public and welfare sectors are particularly visible in social and health services and in day care for children, says Päivi Niemi-Laine, President of JHL.
The effects will be extensive, and they will certainly be visible in such a way that there will not be enough staff present.
Everyone has to think about how they are going to get their children.
It is now up to the employer to make sure that the services play their part and that no one’s life is in danger,” Niemi-Laine told STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the shortage of employees was also evident at the beginning of the year, when JHL’s members were banned from working overtime and changing shifts due to contract negotiations.
Through flexibility, employers have made it possible for employees not to be hired, but to work overtime or shifts.
This is not yet an industrial action.
As far as occupational safety and health is concerned, it is the norm for every employee to take care of regular working hours and only do them.
JHL opposes the Government’s intention to reduce the protection against dismissal of small companies.
Markku Jalonen, the labour market director of municipal employers, does not begin to assess the effects of overtime and shift-changing prohibitions in advance.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although the services may be weakened.
Employers all over Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations for what can be done.
The area is so vast, social and health care services and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The impacts can vary very much by industry, region and employer,” Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen says that last week we already had experiences of similar, three-day-long activities by, for example, the Finnish Association of Nurses and Nurses Super and the Finnish Social and Health Care Trade Union Tehy.
Their effects were rather minor.
JHL’s prohibition on overtime work and shift changes applies, for example, to employees in municipalities, churches, the state and the private social and health care sector.
For example, childminders are excluded.
At this stage, the industrial action concerns almost 100 000 members of JHL.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL’s actions may take a long time.
The union is also prepared for other industrial action if the preparation of the Redundancy Act continues.
The government should now admit that we are running against the wall and hard.
He believes that both the trade union movement and the government need to come up with a solution.
What’s special about this is that the hard ones are already in the pipe, even though the performance hasn’t been given yet,” Jalonen updates.
The Great Barrier Reef is created by children and adults - the fitness circles of the performance study the gestures of a skate and a seahorse
The Great Coral Reef premiered last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was performed for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the group’s previous works, The Great Coral Reef is a work that will be built from beginning to end together with the audience.
This time, however, a more clearly defined presentation will also be built, which refreshes and crystallises the observations made in the beginning exercises.
There is also enough fairytale magic for children in the theatre.
The child’s perspective has already been included in the preparation of the work.
However, the Great Barrier Reef is not a children’s show, but a show that adults and children do together.
It provides adults with information and observations about children’s way of receiving information and making art.
Children’s ability to throw themselves into exercises and joint games also dissolves the distance between adults and children.
The Great Barrier Reef resembles a satuba-tile, a fitness circuit and a nature-themed infomercial, but ultimately it is tuned around visits in different, non-human conditions.
The Great Barrier Reef begins with exploring the trajectories of corals and the creatures and fish that live on the reef.
Six different fitness circles teach, for example, the gestures of a skate and a sea horse.
Finally, we will make a performance of less than an hour, where music, lights and shiny paints and costumes will help you get to know the life of the coral reef.
In the Great Coral Reef, there are both diving people who observe the life of the coral reef and corals that are being looked at.
In addition, there are organisms that look at corals.
Eyes and observations pointed in many directions make the performance dense and full of life.
Whether it is a landscape of an organism, an organism looking at a landscape, or another organism or landscape looking at an organism - and all this at the same time.
For children, this does not seem difficult.
The In Other Spaces group strives to reach the border between thinking and action, which is challenging when the group consists of both children and adults.
The presence of children makes it even more important.
After the workshop, there will be a silent demonstration on behalf of endangered corals.
Disasters beyond human comprehension should not be allowed to harden, even though it may be difficult to grasp the significance of self-compassion in the face of the prospect of disaster.
In other spaces, he has built his work in a way that respects the diversity of life also with political gestures.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of consciousness, other species, and their future generations, for whose wonder and play it makes room.
Children grow up too fast - I'm happy that in my childhood there were no smartphones
Today’s children and young people are becoming more and more irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking more and more when they are younger and younger.
In my opinion, children should be children throughout their childhood and not mess up their lives because of drugs and sex, because others say they do too.
I was stunned when my friend told me that she had to pick up her sister from the fifth grade this weekend from her "boyfriend".
When he came to pick up his drunken sister, she told him about her sex experiences that night.
I couldn’t imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we’ve been told and warned throughout our childhood that you can’t touch intoxicants and sex is an adult thing.
I wish today’s children could have a decent childhood and not have to grow up too early due to peer pressure.
I keep seeing younger and younger girls on Instagram with makeup on their faces and revealing their clothes.
Snapchat is used in the evenings to take and send revealing photos.
It's getting harder for girls to guess how old they are.
Today’s 13-year-olds can easily look like 18-year-olds and older.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I’m glad I didn’t have smart phones in my childhood.
I was a child for so many years, I didn’t have to think about what other people thought of me.
Yle: Authorities have informed the government that the case of Airiston Helmi is not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, who was interviewed by Yle, the Finnish Security Intelligence Service and the Finnish Defence Forces visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees earlier this week to inform them.
The Finnish government has been told that Airiston Helmi’s investigation is not currently related to national security, but organised crime.
The information on anonymous sources was confirmed to Yle by Chairman of the Defence Committee Ilkka Kanerva (CoC).
According to Kanerva, the Finnish Defence Forces and the Finnish Security Intelligence Service visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily considered to be financial crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there would be anything else,” Kanerva said in an interview with Yle.
According to Yle’s information, so far no evidence of a connection to national security has been found in the seized material, but the investigation is only just beginning.
There is no way to know what is going on,” one of the interviewees said.
The extensive searches that began a week ago in the Turku archipelago and on the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is purely about economic crime or a threat to Finland’s internal security.
Earlier this week, the newspaper put together a story that goes through arguments for and against.
Video: Dream Goal Saved Liverpool's Lost Series
Liverpool's 100 per cent Premier League start came to an end, but it was still a more satisfied team for a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday, it will be exactly one year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran away with a 1-0 away win.
Then Pep Guardiola’s combination sent a signal throughout the Premier League that City was serious now.
We all remember how the last season ended.
And certainly Liverpool manager J<0xC3><0xBB>rgen Klopp came to West London with the same idea.
The Reds had started the Premier League with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool started out stronger and Virgil van Dijk in particular seemed to dominate his own end of the pitch.
On Wednesday, Chelsea won the League Cup away from Anfield Road.
That’s when Eden Hazard stepped up from the bench to solve the match with a great individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was involved right from the start.
In the 25th minute, he played in a small space with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Finally, the Croat saw Hazard leap forward and sent him a perfectly weighted pass.
Hazard swerved a bit to the edge of the penalty area, but from there he bombarded a perfect left leg stroke in the back corner.
Alisson was a bit slow in his fight and only got his finger on the ball.
Klopp must have felt the loss was slightly unfair, as almost immediately afterwards Antonio R<0xC3><0xBC>diger cleared Mo Salah's guidance from the finish line.
In the second period, Chelsea-veskari Kepa also got into action.
The Basque guard reacted quickly to Sadio Mané’s pull and pushed the ball from the pole’s base into a corner kick.
At the other end, Alisson zeroed in on Hazard.
The best place for the guests came in the 72nd minute, when James Milner found Bobby Firmino in his concentration.
However, the brass star’s butt was directed towards his national teammate David Luis, who saved the hosts’ lead.
It didn’t last for the 89th minute either, when Daniel Sturridge was able to shoot freely from the 25m.
Sturridge played in his old home stadium, and in honor of it, the striker bombed an irresistible bet on the top corner.
Liverpool’s 100 per cent league start came to an end with a 1-1 draw, but it’s still at the top of the league – together with Manchester City.
Chelsea are also heavily involved in the championship with two points behind the lead.
The clock shift debate is deep.
I remember a few decades ago when a magazine asked different Finnish influencers what divides the Finnish people.
Juice Leskinen’s answer was the only one I could remember: Nen-terminus.
Some people have nen endings and some don't.
Dividends can be born anywhere, and here was one bidder.
In the EU, Finland has managed to get rid of the annual clock change.
A lot of people agree that changing the clocks twice a year has been a job for fools and caused a lot of problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be, at least in Finland, the easiest phase of the solution, even though it has not been easy.
The most difficult thing now is to decide what time we will end up at: the current summer or winter time or some other time zone.
The public can also express their opinion on the otakantaa.fi website.
The survey was opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and it will be open until Friday 12 October.
The discussion is heated at the coffee tables and on social media, and everyone has something to say.
Those who defend winter time justify their position with the influence of the morning light on people’s well-being, and those who defend summer time with the influence of the evening light on people’s desire for outdoor activities and thus on people’s well-being.
Both sides have strong supporters and good arguments.
Studies have shown that the morning light makes a person’s day more rhythmic and gives him freshness.
On the other hand, if you don’t particularly suffer from waking up in the dark, the light will increase people’s outdoor movement and provide better opportunities for, for example, autumn yard work.
The amount of additional light after a normal working day has already been calculated for its hour.
I’d rather have both, but unfortunately for our location in the northern part of the globe, we can’t help it.
Winters are too dark and summers too bright for many anyway.
A typical feature of the debate on this topic is that one’s own view is promoted and the other’s view is opposed very strongly.
You don’t really listen to the arguments of the other side, because the most important thing is how you feel about it.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on the matter, it is somewhat pointless to try to turn the other person’s head.
It's a waste of gunpowder.
The topic is awfully easy to debate, because it doesn’t require much effort and the mutu-feel is enough to justify it.
Such matters are usually the most controversial and equally fruitless.
It will be a shame if the wrong option is chosen, but I think it will adapt to that as well.
And it always provides a suitable scapegoat if life feels miserable.
Josh fought for a narrow away win.
Josba's first away game against Jymy in floorball in Divari earned him a full three points.
Josba went home from Seinäjoki with a triumphant 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) win.
Nurmo was still leading with a goal at the beginning of the third period, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled men in chains.
At 50.47, brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi conspired to score a 6-5 win.
Both teams played crucial minutes in the semi-finals.
Josba's most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was strong enough to fire anyway, when Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Miika Kosonen (1+0) also played in the second row at the time of his goal.
After three rounds, Josba has six points.
The next stop will be O2-Jyväskylä in two weeks.
200th anniversary of the church on Sunday
The 200th anniversary of the Eno Church will be celebrated tomorrow in part in a very sad mood.
The arson attack on the church last week was a shock.
The church was guarded during the two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still a celebration.
Even if no one wanted to, Eno Church is now the oldest church in the Joensuu Parish Union.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno, despite all the municipalities and other associations in the world.
The family mass begins today at 10 a.m. at Eno Church.
Afterwards, we move to the parish hall to the Karelian banquet table.
Throughout the day, there are all kinds of activities both inside and outside.
For example, the church building can be visited under the guidance of retired churchmaster Ari Räsänen, who has been serving as churchmaster for 37 years.
The celebration of the birth of the Church also marks the end of an era.
The parish house, built in 1982 and already out of use, will be open for the last time today.
We are now in evasive premises at the former municipal hall,” says Markku Koistinen, a chaplain.
The parish house was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has been standing in a healthy place for 200 years.
Elon Musk resigns as chairman of Tesla’s board of directors after $40 million in fraud charges
Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk have settled their lawsuits with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
The SEC suspected Musk of committing securities fraud, and Musk was at risk of being sidelined by the company he founded.
Musk will continue as Tesla’s CEO.
Musk has been forced to step down as Tesla’s chairman for three years.
The company will have to hire an external chairman.
Musk will also be subject to tighter controls.
Under the agreement, Tesla will have to hire two independent executives and will have more control over Musk’s communications.
In addition, Tesla and Musk will each pay $20 million (about $17 million) to settle the case.
“The decision is intended to prevent further market disruption and harm to Tesla shareholders,” said Steven Peikin, director of the SEC.
The case began in August, when Musk tweeted that he might pull the company from the stock exchange.
Musk also wrote that the company’s funding is secured.
The tweet temporarily raised Tesla’s share price.
The SEC said Musk was guilty of securities fraud.
The agency said the tweet was false and misleading, and that Musk had not discussed the arrangement with the company’s other management or potential financiers.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
On Friday, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Musk and the company.
The SEC said it was demanding that Musk be fined and banned from running any more listed companies.
The SEC’s challenge frightened investors, and Tesla’s stock plunged sharply.
More than 800 dead in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami
The death toll from the earthquake and subsequent tsunami in Indonesia has risen to at least 832, the country's disaster agency said.
The death toll is expected to increase as the damage is still being dealt with.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kall, the final figure could reach thousands.
Friday’s earthquake triggered a tsunami that hit the town of Palu on Sulawesi Island.
A tsunami warning was issued immediately after the quake, but it was quickly cancelled.
According to authorities, almost all of the known dead are from Palus, at least for the time being.
Rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the Donggala area near the centre of the quake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Several people are already known to have died.
Ruins of Requests for Help
The Indonesian army has been called in to help rescue workers search for victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived in the affected area today, urged the soldiers to continue the rescue work without getting tired day and night.
One of the focal points of the rescue work is the hotel in Palu, which is still believed to have 50-60 people in its ruins.
The head of the rescue services agency, Muhammad Syaugi, said one person was found alive in the ruins of the Roa-Roa hotel, which is popular with business travellers.
We also heard people asking for help, he said.
According to Syaug, the earthquake and tsunami area would quickly need heavy clearing equipment.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
Help me, you in Palu and nearby.
Family members of a friend of mine are still missing, one of the authors appealed to Facebook.
Politicians' phone numbers leaked to troublemakers in Britain
Many British politicians were harassed when their contact details were leaked due to shortcomings in the app's encryption.
The attackers were able to access the phone numbers of the ministers.
It was an application used by the British Conservative Party’s party congress in the government.
For example, Michael Gove, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and Boris Johnson, the former Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, were harassed.
Several members of parliament received harassment calls.
Due to the lack of encryption in the app, the public had access to the profiles of politicians who were in the Conservative Party’s annual meeting mobile app.
The public had access to the profiles using the politician’s email address, which was easily accessible online.
The person logging into the profile got to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to briefly change Boris Johnson’s profile picture to an offensive porn picture and title.
The profile picture of Michael Goven was changed to that of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows you to log in to other people’s profiles using their email addresses.
Then the sign-in can view the contact information of the profile person and, for example, send messages in the profile person’s name.
The meeting app made every reporter, politician and participant’s phone number public, Foster said.
A spokesman for the Conservative Party apologized for the leak.
He said that the technical problems have been solved and the application is now working safely.
The UK’s ICO is backing the data breach.
The app was developed by the Australian Crown Comms.
The opposition Labour Party is critical of the fact that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
The Wall Suomi quiz has a large number of Poles clapping every week
Spectator-eyed viewers drew attention to the reactions of the studio audience of The Wall Suomi quiz show.
The American format The Wall, which quickly spread around the world, landed on the Finnish version of Nelonen last Saturday.
The game show hosted by Heikki Paasonen has been filmed in Poland in the same studio where other international productions of the format are also made.
In the Polish studio, the shooting possibilities were exceptional, as the format’s large 12-metre-high gaming wall required space.
During the opening period, the audience of the program was raised on social media and bet on Polish.
There was a discussion on Twitter about whether the Polish people sitting in the studio might understand anything about the game being played in Finnish.
Unne Sormunen, the head of Nelonen’s domestic programmes, explains the matter to Iltalehti.
He says that the studio audience includes the players’ close friends, other Finns, expatriates living in Poland and just Polish viewers.
The audience consists of international clappers in Finnish production, just like the audiences of The Wall, which is filmed in the same production space in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such groups, the so-called professional audiences, who attend the filming of different programmes,” Sormunen explains.
He points out that following the game itself is not so difficult to understand, even if you do not understand the language in which it is played.
Red and green balls falling off the wall are easy to distinguish from each other.
However, for foreign-language speakers, there are interpreters in the studio who take care of the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret simultaneously for the studio director all the time the events.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells them what kind of slap they are throwing, for example, and what the situation is going on,” Sormunen says.
He compares the situation to how David Hasselhoff was recently involved in domestic production.
A few years ago David Hasselhoff took part in our Talent Suomen shoot in Finland.
He was constantly getting simultaneous interpretation in his ear and he knew everything that was spoken in Finnish on the set, Sormunen sums up.
A typhoon in southern Japan is heading towards the main islands, officials warn of landslides and flooding
Authorities are also warning of possible landslides and flooding.
At least 50 people have been injured in the typhoon, but authorities say serious injuries have been avoided and no fatalities have been reported.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so strong that it has turned cars around.
According to NHK, people have been evacuated to shelters and electricity has been cut off from more than 300,000 households.
More than 1,000 flights have been cancelled, and high-speed trains have been halted in some places due to the storm.
The storm is expected to hit Osaka around noon Finnish time.
The capital, Tokyo, is not directly on the storm’s path, but there will be strong winds and heavy rains.
Trains have been cancelled in Tokyo.
According to weather scientists, Trami is torturing Japan until Monday.
The skies of the asses grew darker
The early days of the aces have been bad.
The sky was almost dark as the team lost 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1) to Vaasan Sport on Saturday.
The Poriers now have five consecutive losses, and they have a total of two points from six rounds.
No Aces defender or two lower-ranking players have scored yet.
The pressure is also increasing all the time.
The audience was already out of the hall against the sport when almost half of the game was left.
Six games have just been played and, of course, there is no reason to give up.
We have to be careful because we played so poorly.
Especially the performance of the second round was shamefully bad, Jarno Kärki, who made power 1+2 for <0xC3><0x84>ssä, told.
The sport, of course, was a win-win.
The team had a game down on Friday, so you would have thought it would be visible in the making.
You may have seen it, but you didn’t know how to use it.
The number of visitors on Bread Day continued to grow
Bread Day’s mother Pirkko Hyvärinen wonders about the number of spectators in the big hall.
Somehow I thought that maybe this year there wouldn’t be so many people,” Hyvärinen ponders in the morning.
In the autumn of 2017 the Finnish Championships in Traktorikynn<0xC3><0xB6> were held at the same time as Bread Day, so perhaps one would expect that the number of spectators could even decrease slightly from the previous year.
However, the corridors were already clogged well before 10 a.m., the sellers told that they had run out of products, almost 500 portions of news porridge were sold more than before, and Hyvärinen heard that there had been a rise in the number of cars.
The estimated number of visitors has been about 6,000, Hyvärinen will tell later in the afternoon.
The five hours in the morning and in the afternoon were particularly busy for families with children, which attracted them to a record number of places.
In addition, Hyvärinen expects to reach the event even further.
The vendors also make their way to Liperi every year from a larger area.
This year, almost a hundred presenters, sellers of handicrafts, baked goods and harvest products had arrived at the bread store.
Mother of Bread Day Pirkko Hyvärinen admired the audience from the auditorium.
The harvest was blessed at the beginning of the day.
In the children’s series, Teija Kiviniemi’s beautiful bread won the public vote.
Eleven different shapes of bread arrived for the children’s bread competition.
The winner of the rye bread competition, Marjatta Vepsäläinen, spent a day in the martha pie workshop.
7 x the most beautiful lamp - here you can recognize a good lamp
Bring the space to life, create the right atmosphere in the interior and read the book without straining your eyes.
Good lighting is worth the effort.
Here are three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were given by Tarja Jokiniemi, Sales and Marketing Director at Innolux.
Do your eyes a favor.
The importance of lighting increases with the number of years behind.
Adequate light can help with the problems that many people face as they get older, as their vision becomes less clear and more and more people suffer from glare.
As you get older, the need for light also increases.
A 60-year-old needs three times as much light as a 20-year-old.
Therefore, it is worth investing in the healing effects of light and the properties of the luminaire already for health reasons.
A good lamp gives enough light but does not dazzle, Jokiniemi says.
Create beauty around you
The beautiful interior can only be seen with the right lighting solutions.
The current owner has a choice.
The Japanese style is unspoiled, combining Scandinavian and Japanese style.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style, inspired by the 70s, with its strong colours, different shades of metal or ice cream, has become a boom.
Authenticity fascinates me in the same way as other interiors of the home.
The materials now include wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Express Your Personality
On the other hand, people are investing more in their homes now than before, and interior design has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, you want a tailor-made, bold luminaire for your home that has a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So let’s be very design-conscious, Jokiniemi says.
You don’t necessarily buy the latest trend light for your home, but a timeless classic that has been saved for many years.
Certain timeless, jewelled and elegant classics stand out year after year, says Jokiniemi.
Thank you and goodbye!
KooKoo showed the door to a Canadian striker after three games
KooKoo and forward Brendan O'Donnell split.
The Canadian striker played a total of three league games in orange with no points, KooKoo said in a statement.
O'Donnell joined KooKoo in August on a one-year contract that included a trial period until the end of September.
Last season, the 26-year-old forward played in the KHL with Kunlund Red Star and at the KHL farm in the VHL in KRS Heilongjiang.
No word yet on O'Donnell's new partner.
Gameman wants to set an example in recycling - goods are sent to the world in recycling boxes, plastic was replaced by paper
Today, the player recycles not only games but also packaging materials.
The products of our customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered from the online store are packed, for example, in packages from importers.
All packages that come to us will be reused.
We may use the boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in such a condition that it can be used,” says Ville Puurula from Oulun Pelimees.
As a cushioning material, the company mainly uses newspapers and other similar recycled materials.
Avoid bubble wrap as much as possible.
In the near future, we plan to move to recycled materials in envelopes.
The company wants to set an example for others.
According to Puurula, recycling does not cause extra effort.
It’s not a big deal to start recycling.
It also brings financial savings when, for example, cardboard packaging is reused.
Recycling is a natural fit for Pelimies operations, as in addition to new products, the store’s key product range includes used games and equipment.
Every fashion-conscious purchase: The same shirt works in every outfit
Classic clothing works from season to season in any outfit.
With their versatility, they form the basis of a good wardrobe, as it is easy to put together different outfits around high-quality classics, even at an affordable price.
In autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality knitwear.
This category also includes the black polo.
Black knit with turtlenecks made of natural material can not be a mistake purchase.
The garment can be combined with straight trousers, tulle skirt or jeans, and you can create both a discreet outfit and a flashy style around it.
The polo sweater is suitable for both the youthful modern dresser and the classically sophisticated stylist.
This is how you create style.
The trendy look of the autumn comes from corduroy trousers in golden brown and wide legs, black turtleneck and grey ankle boots.
The classic polo sweater, together with the other classics, the blue-green checkered skirt and the burgundy loafers, form a feminine and sophisticated ensemble.
Add some edge to a black turtleneck by combining it with casual trendy pieces: a denim skirt, high boots and thick tights.
Young and stylish!
Sabotage by Russian intelligence services has a long tradition
There is no reason to believe that the Russian Federation’s foreign intelligence SVR or military intelligence GRU have abandoned this course of action.
During the Soviet period, the so-called DRG groups specialized in sabotage activities.
The name comes from the Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaja gruppa: sabotage and reconnaissance group.
Soviet KGB agents in the West prepared detailed plans for important sabotage targets, says KGB archivist Vasily Mitrokhin (1922-2004), who defected to the West.
His knowledge was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
The sites included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, the KGB acquired DRGs uniforms and accessories for covert operations for the Bundeswehr, railways, gamekeepers and road workers.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed up in local Ukrainian police riot gear, set up checkpoints on roads leading from the peninsula to Ukraine, and isolated Crimea from their motherland.
During the Cold War, agents hid supplies containing mines, explosives, detonators, and communications equipment in the terrain for sabotage groups.
In 1998, a KGB cache was found in Switzerland, where a mine exploded while authorities were spraying it with a water cannon.
Police caught four drunk drivers in the area last night.
Police caught four drunk drivers in different parts of North Karelia between Friday and Saturday night.
In Joensuu, an 18-year-old man from Kontiolahti blew 1.57 per mil.
At 3:30 a.m. he was driving at the beginning of Kajaanintie with two passengers.
A 19-year-old local man alone in the car blew 1.54 per mil, police said.
There were no serious injuries at the exit.
A 20-year-old man driving a car in the centre of Outokumpu blew 1.33 per mil into a breathalyser.
The police suspect the male drivers in question of aggravated drunken driving and the driver of Polvijärvi of endangering traffic safety.
On Saturday morning, a 36-year-old man driving a local van at the intersection of <0xC3><0x96>ll<0xC3><0xB6>läntie and Hoikantie in Tuupovaara blew 0.52 per mil.
He is suspected of drunk driving.
Police are requesting evidence of a stabbing at the Turku railway station after midnight.
Police say the man was assaulted in a parking lot outside the station with life-threatening consequences.
The act was recorded on CCTV.
The dark-haired suspects, wearing dark trousers and a brown or beige jacket, left Ratapihankatu towards the bus station immediately after the stabbing.
One of the suspects left Humalistonkatu towards the city centre by bicycle.
Pedestrian killed after being hit by bus in Pori

HPK keeps Riska in its ranks for the rest of the season, Lehtinen’s trial period ended
Mika Toivola, Sports Director of HPK Hämeenlinna, says that Filip Riska (centre) has been important to the team in the beginnings, in the under-play and in the defensive role of the fourth field.
Filip Riska, who played in the trial period in the early autumn, will continue at Hämeenlinna HPK for the rest of the season.
The success of the experienced Riska, 33, in the roles offered to him convinced the club leadership.
Filip has been an important part of our start-up, under-playing and defending on the fourth pitch.
Although there is still room for improvement, it is good for the young team to hold on to such an experienced player,” HPK’s Sports Director Mika Toivola said in a statement.
According to Toivola, the value of the risk increases when playing the Liiga games.
Riska, a centre from Jakobstad, has previously played in JYP, Luko and Sport.
Oskari Lehtinen was left without a contract after the trial period.
The real story on TV today: The climber was left to die twice
Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest.
Tonight’s film is based on them.
Everest is now on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating blizzard surprised climbers on Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákur’s 2015 directing is about a survival battle that has been discussed in detail.
Films have been made about this tragedy, and documentaries have been made before.
The real events will be discussed in this case as well.
The world’s tallest mountain took the lives of eight climbers 22 years ago.
Two of them were experienced leaders of the expeditions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who guided Weathers.
Weathers' life could have been saved by an eye operation before he left for Nepal.
As a result of this and atmospheric pressure, he lost his sight, so the conquest of the peak had to be skipped.
Rob Hall kept going and never came back.
The battle between life and death had only just begun.
When the storm came, he got lost and could not find his way back to the camp.
When they came looking for him, they found him in such poor condition that they did not believe in his survival.
Weathers was left to die.
But miraculously, he got back on his feet and found the others.
It was thought that Weathers was still dying, and once again he was left to his own devices.
Against all odds, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even fellow climbers began to believe enough that he was given help.
Beck Weathers is played by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall as Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer as Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
The 200-year-old church was celebrated today.
The 200-year-old church was celebrated today.
The church was inaugurated on October 4, 1818, and a family celebration was prepared for Sunday.
The party started on Eno Church Hill at 10 a.m. with a family mass, after which there has been a Karelian feast at Eno Parish House.
The church was full.
517 people participated in the family fair.
The parishioner Armi Rautavuori was glad that so many people had come to the church.
It will be a great joy for a long time to come and give strength to the work, Rautavuori (pictured) says.
Many people have been touched by the fire at the church and it was not ignored at the 200th anniversary of the Eno parish.
The church is now the oldest of the Evangelical Lutheran parishes in Joensuu after the church was destroyed by fire.
The wooden church in Kiihtelysvaara was completed in 1770.
In the morning a prayer was held in the danger of acceleration, where the church destroyed by fire was silenced and remembered.
Photos and videos: Medican showed his power in Greece - The sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A hurricane-like storm hit Greece on Saturday.
A Mediterranean hurricane is called Zorba.
The Greek meteorological institute has issued a red weather warning for the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
Photos from the area show a lot of flooding throughout Greece.
A video posted on Twitter shows how a river instead of a street has suddenly appeared between the houses in the town of Kiato in the Corinthian region due to flooding.
The second video shows how the car has been flooded.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese peninsula, strong winds caused a strong sea.
The Embassy of Finland in Athens instructs people on its Facebook page to prepare for the storm in Greece.
The delegation urges to follow the weather reports and the instructions of the local authorities.
A Mediterranean hurricane, or medic, brings heavy rains and even the threat of flooding.
According to a study published in 2011, medics appear only once or twice a year worldwide, typically around September and October, when sea temperatures are still high.
The storm left behind floods in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey northwards and towards Europe.
Concerns have also been voiced in Greek refugee camps on islands such as Lesbos.
The thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the camps have limited access to proper shelter.
The storm will also hit areas around Athens that were destroyed by wildfires in the summer.
The medical profession in Greece was also affected last November.
We should not go to sea now, but the flights are still on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently on holiday on the Greek islands threatened by the autumn storm
Excursions to the sea are cancelled, and even when walking, you should be careful not to let branches or other bulk material fly over you in a storm.
These are the instructions the guides have given to over 3,500 Finns on holiday in Greece over the weekend.
The instructions will be needed, as even the hurricane Zorbas is predicted to hit the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, near the island of Crete, gusts of wind can reach speeds of up to 45 metres per second.
Heavy rains add to the misery of the weather.
According to the tour operators, all those who have travelled to Greece via Aurinkomatkat and Tui and have given their phone numbers have been warned about the strong winds by text message.
In the air, the sun and the heat
According to Inka Ikonen, a communications specialist at Aurinkomatkat, the worst has been avoided at the resorts by early Saturday evening.
For example, flights have landed and departed according to the normal schedule.
Of course, we are monitoring the situation all the time.
Safety goes first.
Antonia Schroderus, a Tui media officer, says that their flights have also been on schedule.
We are in constant contact with our on-site staff.
At least Crete was still peaceful, he said early Saturday evening.
The aid currently has a total of more than 1,500 Finnish passengers on the most popular Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are vacationing in smaller destinations.
The worst storm on the island of Kos is expected to hit Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon in Rhodes, the sun had also flashed and the temperature had reached 27 degrees, Aurinkomatkat Ikonen says.
Zorbas is expected to become the next Turkish troublemaker, albeit with some moderation.
In case of this, we have already contacted Turkey and our personnel there, and checked the number of Finns flying to Antalya, for example, with Tui,” says Schroderus.
Shirly Karvinen and Janni Huss wear identical evening dresses in the Missifinal - this is how they reacted to the situation
Media persona and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived to the Miss Finland final on Saturday in an open-backed evening dress.
Hussi says she got the dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals, who found me a great dress for this evening, Hussi smiles.
The exact same silver evening dress had also been chosen by the host Shirly Karvinen.
The two of them also noticed their similar outfits and reacted to the situation with a laugh.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanomat that he was in a hurry to get ready, and he had to get dressed on the plane.
Hussi works as a backstage and red carpet host in the Missifinals, interviewing the front-row stars who arrive.
Huss has a recent move because he moved from Kamppi to Jätkäsaari on Friday
I'm going to stay there for now, see what happens.
It is essential that the new apartment has its own study, Hussi reflected.
Before moving to Greece, Hussi went on holiday alone.
It was wonderful, I was only at the hotel for a week without leaving anywhere.
When the stress erupted, I got a cold, but otherwise the holiday was really successful, Hussi says.
Shirly Karvinen's behaviour on the plane attracted a lot of attention - attracted the curious eyes of pensioners
The presenter and Miss Finland 2016 Shirly Karvinen told us that on the red carpet of the Miss Finland final she had enough to do with radio shows and Love Island Finland.
There has been enough haste, even to the extent that Garvinen arrived at the final directly from Finnair.
I did my makeup and my hair on the plane.
This is the glamour.
The evening dress change at home, Garfield laughs.
Karvinen says she pulled out her make-up in the middle of pensioners.
His preparation also attracted the attention of fellow passengers.
I had a big mirror and I could see people's eyes in the mirror.
My makeup was fun, at least for others.
Garfield flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he spends a few days at a time.
Karvinen says he enjoyed his job as the host of Love Island Finland.
He says his experience has been unstoppable so far.
Karvinen says she went to see the singles on Friday.
It's kind of brutal.
They are the real feelings of people, Karvinen describes the feelings of the singles in the program.
How do I wear over-the-knee boots?
Three perfect example outfits
Classic clothes are pieces of clothing that work from season to season in any outfit.
The classics are often decades old, but sometimes there are more modern ones.
The over-the-knee boots, which became a hit in the autumn and winter seasons a few years ago, have not gone anywhere.
As the name suggests, the boots that reach above the knee are repeated in style from year to year and season to season.
Impressive boots share the opinions of users, but the bold model is worth trying, well - bravely.
Over-the-knee boots are actually suitable for any outfit.
Whether jeans, lace, tulle or leotard, the simple leather or faux leather surface of the boots works.
The long boots look great both in party look and casual outfits.
Black over-the-knee boots are perfect for even the most delicate outfits.
They balance the femininity of a pink pleated skirt with flowers and a soft, chunky knit.
A fresh but autumnally stylish everyday outfit for a romantic taste.
The strong and slightly retro-inspired outfit is made of a long copper-brown velvet dress, over-the-knee boots, eye-catching earrings and a studded bag.
While the over-the-knee boots have a certain sophistication, they are also perfect for casual everyday wear, along with a t-shirt, long shorts and a trendy cap.
Wonderfully easy and yet so stylish!
Two self-driving cars will start operating in Espoo
They will operate for the rest of the year and pick up passengers, the City of Espoo informs.
Otaniemi’s robot cars will play the role of a bus simulator, as traffic in the area is planned to be started by a robot bus next spring.
The project will develop and pilot year-round robotic vehicle traffic and test the technical functionality of the vehicles in Finnish conditions.
The experiment will show how robot cars cope with the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says Traffic Management Manager Johanna Nyberg.
For the first time, self-driving cars will be fully automated in traffic without any special traffic arrangements.
The safety of vehicles is always the responsibility of the accompanying passenger.
The vehicles are constantly sensing their surroundings with several sensors and assessing whether the driveway is free.
If it is not, they will interpret whether the detected obstacle is a vehicle, a bicycle or, for example, a snowflake, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, which is responsible for the development of robotic traffic.
Robot cars run three days a week throughout the autumn: Tuesdays at 13-15.30, Wednesdays at 10-15 and Thursdays at 10-15.
Robot cars stop at six stops along the route and pick up passengers.
Stops of robot cars are identified by stop markings.
The best way to get there is from stop number 1 in Otakaari.
The bassist of Mokoma fell off the stage in the middle of a gig and was injured.
The band Mokoma announces on their Facebook page the unexpected situation at Pakkahuone’s gig in Tampere.
Mokoma’s gig at Pakkahuone in Tampere took a dramatic turn on Saturday, when the band’s bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell off the stage in the middle of the performance.
It happened when the band was pulling the last song of the night.
The swindler's wrist was broken.
The band announces this on their Facebook page.
"I'm in the Spirit!"
Santtu tripped yesterday at Pakkahuone from the stage in the last song and broke his wrist.
Let's wish the metal brother a speedy recovery!
The rest of the tour will be carried out by alternate crews.
Fans respond with concern to a photo update of bassist Santtu lying on the bed with a cast in his hand.
This news has been long awaited, there was a lot of worry about how bad it was.
The relief is great, the bones thankfully heal over time.
Cheers and a speedy recovery for Santtu and a good follow-up to the tour for the rest of the band!
And thank you for yesterday, it was a great gig, but you promise to leave out this strong drama from the end of the gig in the future?
Police supervised hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The Eastern Finland Police Department conducted hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday together with Metsähallitus and the Finnish Wildlife Agency in North Karelia and Upper Savo, wilderness contact persons of the Police Department told on social media on Saturday.
The main focus of surveillance was on the legality and permissibility of hunting.
Each hunter was checked for a hunting card and a hunting permit required on state land.
In addition, the permits for possession of hunting weapons and the permitted number of self-loading guns used in birding were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the surveillance, and only one hunter was found during the surveillance without the required hunting permit.
The hunter was given 12 daily fines for unauthorized hunting.
Police also blew up 133 drivers, two of whom are suspected of drunk driving.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic offences in a fine procedure, police said.
In conclusion, hunters comply very well with the permit to hunt.
Many hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
One hunter stated that “I’ve been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone checked the permits.”
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue its hunting supervision in the autumn together with other enforcement authorities.
Mykkänen to visit Turkey to monitor the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen will travel to Turkey in the next few days to monitor the selection of quota refugees arriving in Finland.
This year, 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps have been taken to Finland.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year, with representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment and the police.
The delegation is already conducting interviews in Turkey.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will first select people who are particularly vulnerable.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered particularly vulnerable in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, the disabled and sick, women and children.
More people are elected to the group of people coming to Finland than there are in the quota, because in practice some people do not arrive for various reasons.
During his trip, Mykkänen will also meet the Turkish Minister of the Interior S<0xC3><0xBC>leyman Soylu and NGOs operating on the Syrian border.
Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior Ilkka Salmi will also take part in the trip.
Talked about raising the quota
Finland has been taking in quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
For a couple of years, the quota was 1 050 per year, but no agreement has been reached on raising it in the Government since then.
The Coalition Party has been in favour of raising the quota, but the project has recently fallen into the hands of the blues.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre Party) recently proposed a gradual increase in the quota to 1,500-2,000 people per year.
Mykkänen’s visit is the first during this government term that the Minister of the Interior will do on the spot to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The previous Ministers of the Interior Petteri Orpo (ECtHR) and Paula Risikko (ECtR) were able to move to their new positions before the visits could be arranged.
Finland will receive EUR 10,000 in support from the EU for every refugee in a particularly vulnerable situation.
Now we're going to go crazy - we don't know whether to laugh or cry anymore
Last Saturday, Karjalainen reported on a bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act.
The article gave the impression that in principle the bill prohibits the keeping of all animals as production animals, pets or other business activities that are not specifically permitted by ministerial decrees.
In other words, everything else is prohibited in principle, except for the animals specifically mentioned in the decree.
If the bill turns out to be a law, it will probably mean that we are abandoning the general principle in Western democracies that the law specifically prohibits activities that endanger the security of society or good manners.
In principle, we are now introducing a ban on all activities that are not expressly permitted by law or regulation.
The change means that nothing new can be tried out, for example, in business operations, and nothing else can be done, until the law or decree approving it has been passed.
The Government’s activities in legislative drafting in general have been weak.
If we start out on the path that in Finland, in principle, everything is forbidden, which is not specifically allowed, we no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that the Animal Welfare Act requires an update.
But this kind of legislation is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I am not very familiar with the Constitution, but I wonder whether it will accept such a 'everything is prohibited, which is not expressly permitted by law or regulation' procedure.
I hope that there will be a sensible minister who will halt the progress of such a legislative project.
Metti Forssell tips: The four trendiest skirts of autumn
This autumn's trendwear comes in a snake print.
It looks especially good in the skirts.
Combine a snake-patterned skirt with more discreet tops, such as a turtleneck or a plain t-shirt, to keep the look stylish.
This autumn you can see a lot of silk and especially the silk skirt is one of the trendiest pieces of clothing this season.
Combine a stunning silk skirt with a sophisticated feminine top or casually as a pair.
You can play braver with a silk skirt and throw on sneakers or cowboy boots for example.
No matter if it’s gray, brown or multi-tone, all the checked skirts are now part of every woman’s must have suit.
Do not hesitate to combine different colours with each other and play with the check pattern even on the different tops.
For example, the combination of square and ball is beautiful.
Asymmetric hems are a breath of summer lightness that you can take with you to autumn.
The asymmetrical hem is at the same time feminine and playful and fits perfectly for both everyday and festive occasions.
Baby Alexia, 3 months, sulks sweetly in Jere’s arms
In the Karalahti family picture, the focus is on the sweet three-month-old baby Alexia.
Nanna Karalahti tells about the Aito day care centre established in Kerava.
Sports entrepreneur Nanna Karalahti, 30, and ex-ice hockey player Jere Karalahti, 43, received a family increase at the beginning of July.
The couple’s firstborn son, Jax, turned 2 years old in May, while little Alexia is only a three-month-old baby.
Nanna Karalahti recently held a training camp with Martina Aitolehti in Marbella, Spain, where the whole Karalahti family was involved.
Nanna posted on Instagram a picture of the Spanish atmosphere, with the whole Karalahti family posing.
The children Jax and Alexia are in the arms of their parents.
Attention is drawn to the adorable baby Alexia, who rests on Jere’s arms.
Grateful for this.
Grateful for goodness, for forgiveness, for people’s generosity and joy, Nanna Karalahti writes alongside the family portrait.
Nanna Karalahti and ex-ice hockey player Jere Karalahti, who became public through the Fitness Diaries program, recently went into the day care business and opened the Aito day care centre in Kerava.
In addition to Karalahti, food specialist Johannes Laine and Hanna Liisanantti, who is responsible for education, are also involved in the company.
Johanna Tervo was hired as the day care centre manager.
Turkey warns against charging mobile phones in case of storm
Hurricane Zorba, which hit Greece on Saturday, is expected to hit Turkey on Sunday.
Meteorologists on Saturday specifically warned sailors, fishermen and farmers on the west coast of the country of Greece about the storm, writes CNN T<0xC3><0xBC>rk.
A tropical storm is said to move along the coast from south to north during the day.
Disaster and emergency authorities on Saturday evening urged citizens to recharge their mobile phones before the storm hits and to make sure the internet is up and running so people can get timely updates, local news agency Anadolu Ajansi said.
People have been told to stay at home and away from windows, and to move garden furniture away from the wind, for example.
Heavy rain is expected in Turkey and the wind is expected to blow 28-33 meters per second.
Red weather warning in Greece
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service issued a red weather warning for the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete in southern Greece.
The Ministry for Foreign Affairs and travel agencies that organise trips to Greece warned Finns in Greece about the Zorba storm.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Travelers were advised to follow weather reports and instructions from local authorities.
A while ago when I got in touch, there was a lot of wind and it was raining.
The people were quite calm,” communications manager Laura Aaltonen from the travel agency Tui told STT on Saturday.
He described the situation as similar on Saturday night.
By the evening, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs had also received no messages from Finns in distress.
Ships in several Greek ports did not operate on Saturday, the local news agency Amna reported.
Boat trips to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, the travel agencies told STT.
According to the Finnish Embassy in Athens, temporary disruptions to air and ship traffic were expected.
Finnair was told on Saturday that the weather situation is being actively monitored.
Kimi Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen sums up the reason for Mercedes’ superiority over Ferrari
Ferrari’s Kimi Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen admitted that the worst competitor Mercedes was too hard in the qualifying stages of the Russian GP.
However, there is no reason to panic in the Ferrari camp, an experienced driver said.
They were just faster than us, but there is nothing huge about it.
Our car was the best in qualifying for the whole weekend so far, but they were just too fast, finished fourth and with their team-mate Sebastian Vettel clearly missed the Mercedes pace, Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen said.
Ferrari had a tough time in Singapore last year.
They asked Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen what caused the sudden drop from the Mercedes.
They seem to go faster than we do - it's as simple as that.
If I knew the reason for that, we'd probably be going at the same speed as them.
But I know no more than anyone else.
This is always speculation, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
A rare delicacy was seen in qualifying for Sauber, the future team of Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen.
Räikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen's replacement Charles Leclerc was seventh, and Marcus Ericsson was also in the final qualifying session.
For Swedish drivers, the 10th starting position is the best in over three years.
And even though in the second driving session no more than five drivers did not drive at all, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging for Raikkonen for the future?
Yes, compared to where they were in the early days, the step forward has been a big one.
There's a different story next year, so let's see, let's see.
Robert Helenius knocks out Erkan Teper: "Robbe is back"
The match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper in Stuttgart went smoothly.
The German was a more proactive player in the ring, but he didn't get a good shot.
Clearly more reachable Helenius controlled the match with his tough series that found their way well.
The Finn was also in a much better physical condition than Teper.
The solution came in the eighth round, when Helenius knocked Teper out with his left straight.
The hit was so strong that the veteran in front of the home crowd didn’t even try to get up from the carpet.
When the victory was confirmed, Helenius breathed quite moderately.
In the frame interview, he first praised the good atmosphere created by the audience and his opponent.
Then he changed his language for a moment.
Thank you to all the viewers and Finnish supporters.
We took the belt with us today.
Helenius was delighted immediately after the match.
It was a huge win for Helenius.
There might even be a chance to get to the World Cup,” Helenius commented to Iltalehti before the match.
The loss could have ended his entire boxing career.
Of course I've been thinking about it.
It’s not going to get any younger,” 34-year-old Helenius admitted before the Teper encounter.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster may increase
According to The Guardian, the country’s vice-president is calling for a clear rise in the number of victims.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kall, the total number of victims could reach thousands.
Difficult conditions
Rescuers search for those trapped, as well as the dead, in the worst-hit areas of Sulawesi Island: the port city and its neighboring town of Donggala.
So far, all the victims are from Palu, the situation in Donggala is not yet clear.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 have been seriously injured.
There are still people in the collapsed buildings who the rescuers have not been able to get out.
For example, the Roa Roa hotel in Palu has collapsed.
Rescuers say they have heard the cries of people trapped in the rubble, but the lack of clearance equipment has delayed the start of rescue work.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has ordered the army to carry out rescue and clearing work.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, as electricity and telecommunications are cut off in many places in the disaster area.
Fuel reserves are also running out.
The hesitant answer and long deliberation of the Miss Finland finalist caused a laugh
Billnäsin Ruukki is currently electing a new Miss Finland.
In the interview round, each Missifinalist was asked a question.
The finalists drew the question about the glass bowl on stage.
Especially the finalist number six Emilia Anttikoski’s, 23, hesitant answer caused a sweet but benevolent laugh in the audience present.
The question to Anttikoski had come through Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what is the last book the missifinalist has read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer for a good while before he began to hesitate.
Thanks for the question, Ellie.
The last book I have read is..., Anttikoski said thinking.
The pause caused laughter in the audience, until Anttikoski continued his reply:
The last book I read is...
I read books at school!
Probably something related to economics.
So the last book I’ve read is Economics by someone, Anttikoski replied.
After his reply, Anttikoski received a resounding applause accompanied by laughter from the audience.
Previously, on the Missi tour, Anttikoski attracted attention because he did not want to pose in underwear because of his principle.
The 2018 Miss Finland will be crowned at 9 p.m., when Michaela S<0xC3><0xB6>derholm of last year's Miss Finland will abdicate.
Sike's apple-pear cake takes your tongue out
This recipe is for those who have good, acidic apples of their own, because the domestic apple is shockingly expensive in the store.
You may have to buy a pear, although quite a few of them already have a pear tree.
This cake can also be made only from apples, if you do not want to buy pears.
Of course, the taste will be more diverse if you also invest in the pear in the cake.
Peel the apples and pears and remove the seed pods.
Slice.
Melt the butter in a saucepan.
Whisk the eggs and sugar until foamy, then add the corn flour and melted butter to the foam.
Combine the cornstarch and baking powder and add to the dough.
Add almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Line the bread pan with baking paper, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the pan and spread the pear slices on top of the sugar.
Spoon half of the dough on top of the pear slices and the apple slices on top of the dough.
Spoon the rest of the batter over the apple slices.
Cook in the oven at 180 degrees for about an hour until the surface is beautifully brown.
Allow to cool in the pan and then set aside on a serving plate.
Cut the cake until it has cooled down.
The cake is fragile in structure and crumbles easily because the dough contains almond and corn flour that is gluten-free.
Ruka to host international crime literature event in January
An international literature festival focusing on Nordic crime literature will be held in Kuusamon Ruka in January for the first time.
The programme of the Nordic Noir event consists of interviews, panel discussions and other literature-related events, as well as jazz music.
The festival’s literary guests include, among others, Jens Lapidus, the star of Swedish detective fiction, and the Swedish duo Jerker Eriksson and H<0xC3><0xA5>kan Axlander Sundquist, who can be found behind the pen name Erik Axel Sund.
In addition to Swedish names, the event will also feature guest writers from Iceland, Norway and Finland.
Finnish writers are represented by Max Seeck.
According to the festival organizers, the northern location, nature, the dark season and Kuusamo’s unique surroundings provide a unique literary experience.
Status symbols do not attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic or admirable?
Researchers at the University of Sydney have outlined two slightly different types of "coolness": the generally attractive coolness and the contrasting dissident coolness.
The attractively cool people, according to the researchers, had many traits that were considered socially desirable: they were outgoing, friendly, amicable, and competent.
Dissidents, on the other hand, were characterized by distance, independence, insurrection, and edge.
They thirsted for experience and cared little for outside opinions.
Both types were associated with good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of the tough guy is not cool in the long run: a high status in adolescence does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is according to a 2014 study published in the journal Child Development.
Young people who socialized early, partyed, sought out good-looking people and sought the favor of others had an increased risk of substance abuse and crime as young adults.
In their relationships, they fared less well than their more inconspicuous peers.
High-status cars, branded bags or watches do not make you cool - or at least not genuinely attractive company.
In a study published in August in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science, the vast majority of people were more willing to befriend people who wore a regular market shirt than those who wore a designer shirt — despite the fact that most people chose a designer shirt when they first met.
If you’re on Greek islands, be careful!
There's a cyclone coming, a weather warning screaming red.
During the weekend in southern Greece, it can rain as much as in Finland on average in six months.
Hurricane Zorbas will hit Greece this weekend.
Be prepared if you are in the Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens announces it on its Facebook page.
According to the Embassy, the Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning for the areas.
The approaching storm is also reported on the weather service Foreca’s blog.
According to it, the storm’s strongest gusts are up to 45 meters per second.
By comparison, the Kuisma storm that hit Finland in the early part of the week blew at its peak of 31 metres per second.
However, according to the blog, the main concern of storm Zorbas is not the wind, but heavy rains.
Over the weekend, more than 300 millimeters of water can enter southern Greece.
This corresponds to about half of Finland’s annual rainfall.
Severe Weather Europa has posted a video of the storm on its Facebook page.
Hurricane Zorbas has caused floods in Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.
Do you recognize Love Island Suomi -Anku, drooled by men?
Appears in confusing YouTube videos
Few people know that in the Love Island Suomi series, the beauty Anku, drooled by several men, also appears in strange YouTube videos published in 2010 as a craft lady.
In the videos, Anku advises crafters, among other things, to make an octopus from an old roll of kitchen paper.
Anku also shows how you can make a hedgehog with real spikes out of tights.
Now we are going to make the easter grasses grow, but we are going to do it in a surprising way, Anku hints and presents sawdust, tights and the seeds of the grass, of which he makes a hedgehog.
You can watch the videos below or on Ankku’s Youtube channel here.
Valtteri Bottas was shaking and bursting with adrenaline in Sochi - is he going to be Hamilton's helper on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas was still shaking a few tens of minutes after his pole position in the Russian GP when he was in front of the media.
The great lap left behind Mercedes’ number one star Lewis Hamilton, and it was certainly an important criticism mentally to the Finnish driver who gathered this season.
Nice round.
“I don’t know what happened to Lewis when he left the round.
It feels good, I'm still shaking a little bit, Bottas explained.
I’ve only been on the stake once this year, in Austria (mid-summer), so it’s been quite a while.
This track has been good for me before, and I got good laps again.
It is not easy to pass on the Sochi track, so the start plays an especially big role.
And of course, Bottas had to answer the question of whether he would win the race tomorrow or whether it would be Hamilton’s coming to the World Championship title.
My starting point for the race is definitely to try and win.
There can be no other goal when leaving the pile, Bottas piled.
But as a team, we fight for both championships.
Lewis’ lead to Sebastian Vettel is quite big and the difference to me is very big, so we have to keep that in mind.
Let’s see what happens, though.
After the race, Hamilton was genuinely happy with Bottas’ success, and Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff was also delighted.
Lewis had the intention to defeat Valtteri, but he did not succeed in turning seven.
Valtteri knows that he has to tear everything out of himself in order to win Lewis.
And he was so charged that adrenaline was gushing out of his ears,” Wolff said.
When asked if Bottas and Hamilton would be able to drive fairly, Wolff replied in an evasive manner.
We'll talk tomorrow morning, and we'll see how the race goes.
Erno Kinnunen from Kitee won the Finnish Rally Championship
The Finnish Rally Championship series rarely ended.
Hardly ever before have the brothers become champions of Finland at the same time.
Now Eerik and Henrik Pietarinen from Tuusula did it in the final rally around Turku and Salo, as Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 class.
Kitee-based Erno Kinnunen secured the best result of his career when the third place in the final race sealed him the Finnish championship in the two-wheel drive category.
Kinnunen and Ville Mäkelä, who competed in the Honda Civic, started the Turku event with patience, because the starting points were clear: placing in the top group would guarantee the title of Finnish Champion.
In the darkness of Friday night, the duo had to give a handicap when some of the extra lights failed on the second stage.
It was a long way to go, but it was a long way to go.
In a situation like that, you can't go soft on people.
On Saturday, only Jussi Tepo, who was second in the series, was followed, Kinnunen said.
Syria calls on US, France and Turkey to withdraw troops
Syria’s foreign minister has called on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said that foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and unconditionally.
Muallem said that foreign troops are in Syria to fight terrorism, and the war against terrorists is “almost over,” he said.
In his UN speech, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to their home countries.
The war, which has lasted seven years, has not ended.
More than 360,000 people have died in the war.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Friday that a meeting with the presidents of France, Russia and Turkey is planned for October.
Not quite the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court Justice drama on TV
Judge Brett Kavanaugh and professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault, got an unusually large number of people in front of the screens.
The U.S. Supreme Court’s nomination drama drew at least 20 million people to their TV screens on Thursday.
At the time, Kavanaugh and Blasey Ford, the California professor who accused Donald Trump of harassment, were before the Senate Judiciary Committee to tell their story.
According to preliminary results, the hearings were followed by a total of 20.4 million viewers on six main channels: ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
In addition to them, several million more followed online consultation.
NBC reported that 6.8 million people watched the live stream, and CNN reported that it had set a year-long record with 8.2 million live stream launches.
CNN’s figure rises to more than 10 million, including those who followed the show via YouTube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also reached 8.0 million.
Digital launches are the channels’ own, TV viewer numbers are from research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen will release the final readings on Monday, but they are still staggering.
Few can reach 20 million.
Over 20 million viewers in the U.S. usually attend only sports matches and the entertainment industry’s major Oscar and Grammy Awards, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and, in 2016, presidential debates.
The most watched program in the United States, the NFL’s annual Super Bowl final, is a long way off.
This year, the Super Bowl drew about 103 million people to NBC.
Last year, Trump’s first speech to Congress was watched by nearly 48 million people and the inauguration by more than 30 million people, according to Nielsen.
A matter of the utmost importance
The Supreme Court’s appointment is an extremely important case in the United States, as the posts are for life.
Trump was already able to appoint one new judge when Antonin Scalia passed away in early 2016 and the Republicans managed to prevent then President Barack Obama from appointing a successor to him.
Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but on a number of issues, he was the so-called scales language whose vote could decide the position of the nine-member court.
She was a supporter of the right to abortion and the rights of sexual minorities, and in 2015, for example, she voted in favour of same-sex marriage throughout the Federal Republic of Germany.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative.
His election to the Supreme Court could lock up the court for decades.
Children have the right to access their information to parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 can view their children’s health information in the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
Initially, the situation with the Kanta service was of course even more worrying: parents were not even able to look at the health information or recipes of the babies.
A temporary correction to the situation was received in autumn 2016 for those under 10 years of age.
Since then, the policy has been promised to be corrected, but it has taken an astonishing amount of time to do so.
Now a correction is in the works - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should have been nothing more than a clamor.
Then, with the layman’s understanding, it is a matter of pressing a button: when the wire is now held shut, it is opened.
Of course, a child can show his or her information to his or her parents if he or she has a bank account or an official ID card.
How many 10-year-olds are there?
The ID card is subject to a fee, and the 10-year-old doesn’t even get access to bank codes.
In practice, no one can see the information of a fourth grader except by asking for it printed.
It is not so much about the rights of parents as about the rights of children.
It is extremely important for the care of the child that the parents can be involved in it.
Teenagers' right to privacy must, of course, be respected.
Minors may also have family situations where not all issues can be discussed freely.
Often they are related to sexual health, for which free care is a deeply relevant human right.
FBI begins exonerating harassment allegations against Kavanaugh
According to US media, the FBI is investigating allegations of harassment by at least two women.
One of the women appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this week.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations of sexual harassment during his studies.
US President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The investigation shall not take longer than one week.
According to the Washington Post, this is a more limited investigation than a criminal investigation and may not be made public.
Man threatens to kill police officers at police station in Kajaani
The captured brawler continued to squirm even at the chamber.
Police said they put him in a police jail to “calm down.”
The police were threatened by a suspected abuser on Saturday night in Kajaani.
Officials are reporting an incident that began when a 30-year-old man filed a lawsuit in a downtown restaurant.
The man first assaulted another client inside a nutrition store.
This led to the restaurant being removed.
Outside, a fighter attacked another man by knocking him down.
When a third party tried to intervene, he hit her, too.
The triple malfeasance led to the police being called.
The man was arrested and taken to the police station, police said.
The suspect continued to act aggressively at the police station.
He kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and beat the police.
Police said the man was sent to a police prison to "calm down".
The man is suspected of three assaults and violent opposition to the official.
Aid agencies prepare to start work in Sulawesi, Indonesia - "Clean water is the most urgent"
The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and other international aid organisations are ready to help on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi,” says Kirsi Haru, UNICEF Finland’s Head of Information.
Local authorities are leading the rescue work, but the need for further assistance is already apparent at this stage.
UNICEF operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, UNICEF always has a full emergency response capability, Haru says.
The first task now is to find the people in the rubble, both the survivors and the dead.
Rescue operations are underway in Sulawesi, but further north in the Donggala area, the situation is less clear.
There are still places where connections don’t work.
The aid measures are difficult because the roads are also broken,” Haru says.
The buildings in Sulawesi are often lightweight, so the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami is large.
When the survivors are found, they will need shelter - at first, for example, tents - and clean water.
In times of crisis, clean water is the most urgent.
For the first time, people can usually be offered water purification tablets, which UNICEF also has in stock.
The aim is to repair water systems as soon as possible, but in an emergency, water is transported, for example, by trucks.
In times of crisis, many children are separated from their parents.
Searching for family members and connecting families is part of Unicef’s mission.
Food aid is provided by the World Food Programme (WFP), which is part of the United Nations.
In the initial phase, emergency aid will use previously collected funds.
Unicef, among others, has already started raising money to help the victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
Billionaire Elon Musk Quits Tesla as Chairman of the Board, Fined $20 Million for Tweets
Elon Musk, the founder of the space rocket and electric car companies, will avoid fraud charges by signing a contract with the Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk quits his job as chairman of Tesla and agrees to a $20 million fine.
Musk will step down as part of a deal he struck with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
By agreeing, Musk avoids fraud charges.
The U.S. Securities Commission (SEC) threatened Musk with securities fraud because of tweets he sent in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing to pull the electric car company Tesla from the stock market, which caused the company’s stock price to soar.
Under the deal, Musk will not be allowed to serve on Tesla’s board of directors for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new “independent member” to its board of directors and appoint two “independent directors” to its management team.
Tesla must also set up a committee to oversee Musk’s communications.
Musk will continue as Tesla’s CEO.
In addition to Musk’s personal $20 million fine, Tesla will also have to pay a $20 million fine to the financial regulator.
Investors misled by tweets
According to the SEC, Musk’s tweets have misled investors and Tesla shareholders.
Musk claimed he would have secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange as a private limited company.
Billionaire tweets said the company would be bought off the stock market for $420 per share.
Tesla’s share price rose more than 10 percent in 24 hours after tweets, but fell later.
The SEC said Musk’s claims had no basis.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated the funding he had claimed.
He had also not discussed the withdrawal from the stock exchange with the rest of the management team or the company’s board of directors.
On Friday, the exchange rate fell 14 percent after the SEC announced a fraud charge.
The news agreement is expected to strengthen the company’s course again.
The Last Judgment is Not a Reason
Of course, the bells of the cathedral do not ring when the hands are not moving.
This is a technical error.
The clock in the tower of Helsinki Cathedral has stopped.
The hands point to 12 o'clock.
The situation is like a mediocre horror film: even when exorcism is heard from the crypt of the church and the organ is playing by itself.
Of course, this is not the case; the clock has stopped for a technical reason: it has broken down.
It has been visited by a repairman, but some parts have broken down and a new part is expected, says suntio Eveliina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the point already mentioned in the Church in Helsinki Twitter account.
The account mentions that the last sentence is not the reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen says the church bells aren't ringing because of a bug.
