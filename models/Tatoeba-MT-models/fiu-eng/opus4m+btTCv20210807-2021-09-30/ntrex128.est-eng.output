Members of the Welsh National Assembly are afraid to look like Muppets
Some members of the National Assembly have agreed to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament or member of the Welsh Parliament).
The theme has begun to change the name of the National Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
The representatives of all political trends at the National Assembly are concerned that this can lead to ridiculousness.
One member of the National Assembly of Laborists said that his group members are concerned because it is glued by the words \"Twp and Pwp\".
To explain to readers outside of Wales: the word daft in Tymri language means a nap and a pwp means a cuckold.
A member of the platform said that the whole group was “not happy” and that other names had been offered.
A member of the Conservative Party in Wales said that his group was “responsibly” to the name change, but noted that the word “MWP” was very similar to the word “Muppet”
To explain: in the language of the square, the expression \"w\" is similar to that of Yorkshire's English.
The National Assembly Commission, which is currently drawing up a bill on the amendment of the name, said: “The final decision on all the names to which members of the National Assembly are invited will of course be taken by the members of the National Assembly.
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public survey on the proposals for the name, which will support the broad re-appointment of the idea of the National Assembly to be referred to as the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission preferred the name \"WMP\", but the participants in the public poll supported the most \"MWP\".
Members of the Assembly are likely to offer other names, but reaching an agreement may be a challenge for President Elin Jones, who should submit a bill of amendment in the coming weeks.
The Reform Act also covers other amendments to the working principles of the National Assembly, including the rules on the withdrawal of the rights of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the Committee system.
The final vote on the appointment of members of the National Assembly shall remain for the members themselves during the legislative debate.
The Macedonians shall hold a referendum on the amendment of the name of the State
On Sunday, voters will vote to call their country “North Macedonia”
The referendum will be held with the aim of settling a dispute of decades with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province, Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that its North Neighbor’s name represents a claim to that territory and has repeatedly objected to the application of the EU and NATO as a member.
The President of Macedonia, Mr Gjorge Ivanov, has said that he intends to ignore the vote.
People’s voters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev, argue, however, that the name change is just the price the country would pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's watches are silent, because the Harlem churches are in trouble.
“The older people I’ve talked to have said that there was a bar and a church on every corner,” said Mr Adams.
“Most are neither”
He said that the disappearance of bars was understandable.
“People communicate differently today,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the neighborhood’s living rooms, where people stay every day.”
However, as far as churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not continue for as long as the managers hope, and, sooner or later, they will return to the beginning.
Adams added that churches can be replaced with apartment houses whose apartments are full of people who do not give the help of the rest of the neighborhood to the rest of the temples.
“The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings are white,” he added, “who therefore accelerates the arrival of this day when all these churches close their doors because it is unlikely that most of the people who live here will become members of these churches”
Both churches were built by the white churches before Harlemish became a Black Metrople, a Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, ten years later, the Church of St Martin.
The first White Methodist Church left in the 1930s.
The Black Church, who had so far worshipped God, took over the property rights of the building.
The Afro-American church of St. Martin’s Church premiered with Rev. John Howard Johnson, who also led the boycott against the 125th Street Stores of Harlem when they refused to hire or promote black people.
In the 1939 fire, the building was severely damaged, but when the members of the family of Father Johnson planned to restore the building, they introduced a krailion or watch game.
Father Johnson's son and heir at St. Martin's Church, Rev. David Johnson, proudly called the Caribbean \"the clocks of the poor.\"
However, the expert who played the krailion in July gave it the second name: “cultural value – and an irreplaceable historical tool”
The expert at Tiffany Ng Michigan University also noted that it was the world’s first career played by a black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who continued to play a greater career 18 years ago in the University of Riverside.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church did not replace him.
The story of architects and contractors, some of whom have included the church’s secular leaders, other bishops, has been played in St Martin’s Church over the past few months.
In July, the governing body of the church, which was composed of secular leaders, complained to the bishops in writing that the bishopric “is trying to pass on the costs, although the opposition was not even related to the remuneration of architects and contractors sent by the bishops.
Some members complained about the poor transparency of the bishop’s actions.
In California, the shark injured a 13-year-old boy who dived into the mornings.
According to the authorities, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who was suffocated in California on the opening day of the morning season.
The attack took place just before seven o'clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB-TV that he had been diving with his friends on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard the boy's arm and then swimd to help the boy get out of the water.
According to Hammel, he initially thought that the boy expressed his enthusiasm for receiving the hoar, but “then he realized that the boy shouted “I was bitten!
I was bitten.
His entire collar was revealed, he described Hammel’s sight of what he saw when he reached the boy.
“I asked everyone to come out of the water: “There is a shark in the water,” Hammel added.
In a life-threatening state, the boy was taken by plane to the children's hospital in San Diego.
The species of shark being attacked is still unknown.
At the press conference, the savior and captain Larry Giles said that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was established that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the injuries of the victim were at the top of the body.
The authorities closed access to Ponto Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and safety purposes from Casablanca to Swam.
Giles added that there are more than 135 shark species in the region, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury is planning to take power on the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains, creating a supermarket-friendly blend of beauty products that also employs expert advisors.
As part of an important intrusion to the UK's 2.7 billion pound beauty market, which continues to be on the rise in sales of fashion and home goods, the wider range of beauty products in 11 stores across the country will be tested, taking them in other stores next year as well.
It is invested in beauty products because supermarkets are looking for ways to use the shelf space previously allocated to televisions, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury said it plans to double the range of its beauty products up to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweeterman and Dr. PawPaw.
For existing product selections from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, more space is also given in brands such as are currently available in Boots stores.
The supermarket will also re-market its makeup series Boutique, where most of the products are suitable for vegans, as young buyers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop is testing its exclusive license in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will be opened this year in Shelly Oak, Birmingham.
Shopping on the website and switching to the daily purchase of small quantities of food from local food stores means that supermarkets need to try more to convince people to visit them.
The CEO of Sainsbury, Mike Coupe, has said that sales are becoming more and more similar to supermarkets, because the supermarket chain is trying to fight cheap sales chains like Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and industrial goods.
Sainsbury has put Argos in hundreds of stores. The same has been done with Habitats sales sites since Sainsbury bought both chains two years ago, which has allegedly supported the sale of food goods and made acquisitions more profitable.
The earlier Supermarket attempt to update its beauty and treatment departments ended with failure.
Sainsbury tried co-operation with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but it ended with a rivet over how to share the revenue from the sale of supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury’s 281-year-old son sold his drug business for 125 million pounds of Celesio, which includes the entire Lloyds Pharmacy trading chain.
The strategy also plays its role in Lloyds, adding to its four shop product range luxury skin care products, including trademarks such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, head of business at Sainsbury, said: “We have changed the appearance and nature of our beauty product exchanges to improve the environment for customers.
We have also spent money on special training for employees who are always willing to advise.
Our brand selection meets every need. A vibrant environment and convenient locations mean, however, that we are now a competitive destination for beauty trading, which can change old shopping methods.
Peter Jones is mad because Holly Willoughby gave up 11 million pounds of deal.
The Dragons Den star Peter Jones left the “morning” when the TV show manager Holly Willoughby gave up 11 million pounds of trade in his lifestyle brand business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby lacks time for home goods and clothing brand Truly.
A few business is compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop.
A 37-year-old TV show “This Morning” manager announced his departure in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den's anger inside Peter Jones, leaving their luxury life-style brand in the last minute to focus on his new successful contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources said that Jones was “maruhane” when a television star girl admitted at a tense meeting that took place at the man’s business empire headquarters in Marlows Buckinghamshire on Tuesday that his new contracts in value of 1.5 million pounds meant that she no longer had enough time to commit to the brand of clothing and clothing.
The company is compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow brand Goop and it was thought to double Willoughby's estimated worth of 11 million pounds.
When a 37-year-old Willoughby announced in Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain for a vacation home.
One source said: “Truly was certainly the main priority of Holly.
It was supposed to secure her far-reaching future, so she thought she was going to do it for the next few decades.
His decision to leave left everything completely confused about the matter.
No one could believe it happened on Tuesday, because it was so close to placing the product series on the market.
Marlow headquarters has a warehouse full of ready-to-sale goods.
The experts believe that the departure of one of the most paid celebrities in the United Kingdom can cost millions of companies, as the choice of which goes from divan mattresses and candles to clothing and home clothing is invested in a handful of money. It may also lead to the later placing of the product on the market.
This may mean the end of a long friendship.
Three children’s mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016. 52-year-old Jones joined the brand as president in March.
Couples go together on holiday trips and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby becomes a M&S brander and he turns out to be Ant McPartlin's ITV TV series \"I'm A Celebrity\"
One of Jones’ close sources said last night: “I don’t want to comment on her business.
Hard talk, after what we fell in love,
Trump joked about criticism, which was aimed at the news for him for a comment that some thought was “reputable to the president” and for excessive positivity towards the North Korean Head of State.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said his adversaries with a “new-student” voice:
“I haven’t given up on anything.”
He noted that Kim was after Trump welcomed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards abandoning North Korea's nuclear weapons, interested in another meeting.
However, negotiations on the abandonment of nuclear weapons have stopped.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world’s leaders on Saturday that North Korea did not see a reaction to the United States’ initial de-sarmation steps.
Mr Selmet noted that the United States will continue with further restrictions on the country.
Trump’s point of view was much more vivid.
“We’re going very well with North Korea,” he said.
“North Korea started a war.
Millions of people would be dead.
Now everything is very good between us.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought good results: there have been completed missile attempts, aided release of hostages and have been organized to bring American servants to their home country.
He also protected his unusual communication with Kim.
“It’s very simple to be a resident, but instead of letting 10,000 people wait outside for this full-time stadium, it’s better to have nearly 200 people here,” Trump said, referring to the crowd in front of us.
Tsunami and earthquake destroy the Indonesian island, killing hundreds of people
When the consequences of the Lombok earthquake were eliminated, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance would not be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok had to be relocated, a national disaster was not declared a precondition for international assistance.
“Also, they have often expressed very clearly that they do not want international help, so the stories are a little complicated,” said Mrs. Sumbung.
While the organization Save the Children brings together a team that would go to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreigners can work in the region.
Mr Sutopo, the President of the National Disaster Board, said that the Indonesian authorities would assess the situation in Palus, in order to decide whether the international authorities would be allowed to contribute to the assistance.
Given the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country has surprisingly little prepared to deal with natural power.
Although shelters have been built in Aceh for tsunamis, they are not particularly common in other coastal areas.
Although the tsunami was warned, the apparent absence of tsunami alerts increased the number of people likely to die.
Traveling between the numerous islands of Indonesia is also quite challenging at the best times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that stops in Lomboki for the treatment of the victims of earthquake is headed to Palu, but it takes at least three days to arrive at a new site.
President Joko Widodo has turned Indonesia into a central part of his election campaign to improve its split infrastructure and has distributed money on roads and railways.
However, fiscal deficits threaten Mr Joko’s government as new elections will be held next year.
Mr Jokot, in Indonesia, is also under pressure from the tensions among those who have left, where the majority of Muslim community members have turned to the older form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands left their homes because of the fights between Christian and Muslim forces, where machetes, bows, arrows and other primitive weapons were used.
See: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge hits the Viking gate in the game against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool's loss in Chelsea at Premier League, at a score of 89 in Stamford Bridge, London, on Saturday.
Sturridge received a meal from Xherdan Shaqir, about 27 metres from Chelsea Gate when his team led 1 :0.
He hit the ball himself on the left before he hit it in the direction of a more distant post.
The ball flew high above the penalty area and hit the top right corner of the network.
It fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabala and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get a position like this, get to the ball, and players like Shaq give the ball as much as possible, so I just tried to win for myself as much time as possible,” said Sturridge on LiverpoolFC.com.
\"I saw Kante coming, I made a touch, and I gave him a blow for a long time without thinking.
At the end of the first half, Chelsea 1 :0 was led by 25 minutes by the Belgian star Eden Hazard at the gate.
Blues attacker fed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic before he turned around in the middle field and hit Liverpool.
Kovacic gave a quick meal in the middle of the field.
Then he created a beautiful air meal, headed to the Hazard Penitentiary.
Hazard got through the defense and hit the network with the left leg of Liverpool player Alisson Becker along the distance to the remote post.
Liverpool plays the Champions League subgroup on Wednesday at 15.00 in Stadio San Paolol Naples, Italy.
Chelsea is facing Videoton in the UEFA Eurolig game on Thursday at 15.00 in London.
The number of people killed in the Indonesian tsunami rose to 832.
The number of people killed in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, the State's disaster agency said Sunday morning.
The crowd of people were trapped on Friday and the 18-metre giants brought about by the ruins of the buildings that collapsed due to the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, said the official spokesperson at the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho press conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu buried under the collapse of buildings.

A 44-year-old woman's body was found at 07:55 in the morning at Grayson Mews at John Street.
The police call to contact people moving in the area who could see or hear something.
Police Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: \"The threat is still quite early, but I would ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and heard or saw anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also ask all taxi drivers who could have recorded something on the sidelines to contact us, as they may have essential information for our investigation.
Police spokesperson confirmed that a woman found in a building was a local resident of Birkenhead.
This afternoon, the woman’s alleged friends came to the event, asking questions about where she was found in the morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police said they would inform the women of the matter at the moment.
The taxi driver at Grayson Mews wanted to go back to the apartment, but the police told him that no one could enter or leave the house.
The man was shocked when he heard the case.
People were told that getting back to the house could take hours.
The police officer said to one man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
One woman was in tears at the scene.
He kept saying, “It’s terrible.”

The shape of Parliament Cromwell is the last monument that is “rewriting history – cause of dispute”
The removal of this would be a poetic justice for the destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in the Taliban style of England, carried out by male inhuman followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crimwell's recommendation as a fool and attempt to rewritten history.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: “In the debate on the elimination of images in the region, the impermissibility of the monument in front of Oliver Cromwell’s Westminster Palace was impossible.
Cromwell did not rob the pictures of the English Civil War itself, nor did he tell others to do so.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell man was sacrificed for the actions of the previous century by Thomas.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent presentation of Cromwell is proof of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history description of the person to whom a number of people think they should continue to pay tribute.
Mr. Goldsmith said to the newspaper The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people thought that at the end of the 19th century, rather than today, as the defender of the Cromwell Parliament, was the defender of external pressure and, in this case, of course, of the royal authority.
Whether this is an accurate reflection is an infinite historical dispute.
It is certain that the controversy of the mid-17th century has shaped the further development of our people and that Cromwell clearly represents one side of this gap.
His achievements as the Lord's Defender also deserve to be celebrated and remembered.
The Chinese Farmer was killed by the killer
According to local media records, a farmer who killed a man was attacked on the market in Southeast China.
A man who was identified only by his family name Yuan was found injured by the artery dead and covered by blood from a crowd near the Liupanshui market in Guizhou Province, reported the South China newspaper \"Morning Post\" on Sunday.
Seakeeper manufacturing in Xiningis Qinghai Province in China on 30 May 2005 to vaccinate pigs at their table in China.
On Wednesday, he had come from his neighboring province, Yunnan, to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the man's cousin found him dead and discovered that the next side was open.
He said that there was a big, bloody mouth.
The investigation of the case-law confirmed that 249.47 kilograms of raspberry, according to the report, had stifled the farmer to death.
“My cousin’s feet were bloody and flattened,” said Guiyang Evening News, “the victim’s cousin Wu’s words.
Security camera recordings showed that Yuan entered the market on Thursday morning at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pig.
His body was found nearly an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up so that he could not attack anyone else until the police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan’s family and market leaders are supposed to discuss the payment of compensation for the death of a man.
Although rarely, it has been observed before that pigs attack people.
In 2016, the pig attacked the woman and her husband in their Massachusetts farm.
Ten years earlier, the pig weighing 294,83 kg nailed the tractor of the Welsh farmer until the man’s wife scared the animal away.
In 2012, when one of Oregon's farmers ate his own pigs, one of Manitoba's farmers told CBC News that the pigs would normally not attack, but because of the taste of the blood, they could go out of their head.
“They’re just playful.
They are very curious Marracrats, whose goal is not to hurt.
They just have to be told enough,\" the man said.
Orcan Rosa's after winds bring large rainfalls in the U.S. Southwest
According to the forecasts, the hurricane Rosa weakens, moving over the north coast of Mexico towards cooler waters.
Nevertheless, in the coming days, Rosa will bring rainfalls to North Mexico and the U.S. southwest of the United States.
On Sunday morning at 05:00, according to the time of the east coast, Rosa was classified as the first category of hurricane with wind blowing 136,78 km per hour, reaching 619,59 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, there will be a low pressure on the Pacific, moving east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the tropical storm on Monday to the Baja California Peninsula, it will begin to direct the deep tropical humidity towards the southeastern part of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa arrives in Mexico, where it rains up to 25.4 centimetres of rain.
Then, the tropical humidity, responsive to the approaching low pressure, in the southeastern part of the country, produces large-scale rainlights in the coming days.
At times, rainfalls, flood water, and possible painty deserts are caused by a rainfall of 2.54 to 10,16 centimetres.
Deep tropical humidity causes an increase in rainfall between five and about seven and a half centimetres per hour, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is also expected to include 508 to 10,16 centimetre rainfalls in certain southeastern parts of the United States, especially in Arizona.
Excessive conditions are possible due to the dispersal of tropical rains.
Certainly, you should not move on foot in the desert if you are at risk of tropical rainfalls.
Strong rain may cause the canyons to become fast-flowing rivers and thunderstorms at times accompanied by bursting wind blows and flying dust.
The approaching low pressure will at times lead to acute rainfalls in the coastal areas of Southern California.
A total rainfall of more than 1.27 centimetres is possible and can cause smaller flood water and sliding roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the region.
Dispersed tropical rainlights begin to approach Arizona on Sunday afternoon and early Monday morning, rainfalls will become extensive on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Strong rainforests reach Four Corner on Tuesday and stay until Wednesday.
In October, high temperatures are predicted in the United States due to Arctic cooling, while in tropical areas temperatures remain high.
Sometimes it will lead to major changes in temperature in small areas.
Sunday’s weather is a great example of important temperature differences in the central part of the United States.
The temperature differences between Kansas City (Missour) and Omaha (Nebraska), as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) range to almost 20 degrees.
In the next few days, you will try to recover a long summer heat.
A large part of the central and eastern parts of the United States is expected to be warm in October with temperatures of 80 genders, ranging from the south to the north of the north of the north to the north of the country.
In New York, a 26.6 soyacrate is expected on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that the U.S. East is likely to experience high average temperatures in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial looked at over 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched six television channels on Thursday, a candidate from the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and a woman accused of sexual violence in the 1980s, who had been accused of taking up a confession against Christine Blasey Ford.
At the same time, political congestion continued, in which broadcasting organisations interrupted the display of regular broadcasts to reflect the last minute rounds of Friday: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake made an agreement with the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation of charges.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that he was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh took him drunk with his head and tried to tear off her clothes at the high school graduation party.
Kavanaugh said in his clerical confession that he was absolutely sure it didn’t happen.
According to the Nielsen report, more than 20.4 million people were likely to be looked at on Friday.
The company calculated the average audience on TV channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other channels showing them, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has problems in calculating the number of people who are looking at transfers in the authorities.
To compare, this is about the same audience as the football final tournament games or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel’s opinion leaders, who have strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led all networks on average at a meeting with 5,69 million viewers throughout the day, said Nielsen.
ABC has 3,26 million viewers in the second place.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC 2,89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen said.
The interest was also great after the trial.
Flake was the central character of the Friday drama.
After the Moderate Republican Bureau made a statement that he voted for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras hit a man on Friday morning when he had fallen under the protestor's bell, trying to go to a court session with an elevator.
He stood in the ground for several minutes when he was accused and was transferred directly to CNN.
\"I'm standing right here, in front of you,\" a woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling the country the truth?”
He was told, “You have power, while so many women have been completely defeated.”
Flake said that his department issued a statement and added before closing the elevator that he had more to say at the hearing of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
The cable and broadcasting networks represented a direct transfer several hours later when the Committee on Justice had to vote to send the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate for voting.
But Flake said he was only doing this in the understanding that the FBI will investigate the charges against the candidate next week, which have been demanded by the Democrats in the minority.
Flake was convinced in part by a conversation with a friend of the Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision had an impact, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the votes of Kavanaugh without the confirmation of the investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation in connection with Kavanaugh's charges.
British Prime Minister May accuses Brexit critics in political game
In an interview on the Sunday Times, the Prime Minister accused those who calculated their plans for leaving the European Union, in a political game, with the future of Britain and the harm of national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will arrive at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with the newspaper that Theresa May, along with former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, pushed Johnson's attack on May so-called Brexit, saying that the proposal on which the UK and the EU should collect each other's tariffs is \"free of brain\".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson suspected of murdering a LSU player
Police arrested a man suspected of shooting a 20-year-old LSU basketball player with Wayde Sims' death.
A 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and placed in prison for second-degree murder, said Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the opposition between Sims and Simpson. The police added that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found glasses at the scene and said they were found with Simpson's DNA, reported by the CBS television channel WAFB.
After the interview with Simpson, the police said the man confessed to shooting Wayde dead.
The lawyer said the man’s bail was set at $350,000 (EUR 308 600.30).
East Baton Rouge's Coroner issued a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the bullet wound caused death in the neck area.
The department thanked the police in Louisiana for the assistance of police officers, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and the people living in the region in investigating the incident, which led to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU Sports Manager Joe Alleva thanked the law enforcement bodies of the region for setting the “feeling and justice” on foot.
Sims was 20 years old.
A 1,98-metre man grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played in LSU basketball.
His average last season of games was 5.6 points and 2.6 table balls.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the whole team was killed because of Wayde's death.
“It’s something you’re always worried about,” Wade said.
Vulkan burns ashes to Mexico City
The volcanic ash, called Popocatepetl, has reached the southernmost parts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for the Prevention of Disasters warned Mexicans on Saturday, telling them to stay away from the volcano, because the crater again began an activity that led to 183 cases of gas emissions and ashes being registered within 24 hours.
The center was on a number of myriads and crayons.
The images shared in social media represented the front of a car covered with ash in various parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysiques noticed an increase in volcanic activity within 72 km from the capital since the 7,1 magnetic earthquake hit the central part of Mexico in September 2017.
A volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police have collisions with Catalonia’s separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the confrontation of the protestors of independence with the rebel police. Thousands joined the anti-democratic protests to celebrate the vote against Catalonia.
A group of fighters who supported the masked separation, who were held back by the wet police, attacked the last eggs and powder paint, causing thick dust clouds to the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
The raids also occurred later when the police had to use knives to control the fights.
For many hours, “No forgetting, no forgiveness,” the advocates of independence sang with the state’s unity-friendly protesters who shouted “Lively Spain.”
According to the local press, 14 people were ill-injured at the medical statement.
The tensions will continue up in the region that supports independence a year later, when Madrid declared the referendum illegal on 1 October, but which the Catalans still favoured.
The voters decided to make an overwhelming decision in favour of independence, although the electoral activity was low, because the voters ignored the vote extensively.
According to the Catalan authorities, around 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to stop the vote in front of the entire voting stations in the region, which led to violent confrontations.
Independence advocates had stayed in front of the voting stations on Friday night, in order to avoid protests supporting the national police.
However, the comments were made, but they had to take another way.
Narcis Termes, who worked as a 68-year-old electrician, participated in a protest that favored separation with his wife, said he had no hope of seeing Catalonia as independent.
“The last year one of the best moments of our lives took place.
I saw my parents crying for a chance to vote, but now we're stuck,\" he said.
Despite the significant but small victory in the regional elections in December last year, it has been difficult for the parties supporting Catalan independence to maintain the capacity to do so this year, as many of the best-known leaders have either gone to exile or have been held in custody and are waiting for a trial to be held in the organisation of a referendum and subsequently declare independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic Joan Puig, who record a demonstration of protest to support the police on his mobile phone, said that the fight was pushed by politicians from both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine leaders of the Catalans, who has been in pre-trial prison since last year, announced that he will be attending the elections of the European Parliament next year.
“Employment in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the pressure of the Spanish government,” he said.

Menga's shot will give Livingston 1-0 victory in front of Rangers
Dolly Menga’s first goal for Livingston
The promoted Livingston Open Rangers to lead Steven Gerrard to the second loss of 18 games during which the man has been a manager of the Ibrox Club.
The Dolly Menga shot proved to be decisive when Gary Holt raised the level in a second to Hibernian.
Gerrard will remain in the first league in this season and will be in response to the next Sunday with the leading Hearts, of which eight points will be in the ground.
Before that, Rangers host Rapid Exports Thursday in Euro League.
In the meantime, Livingston extended his undefeated attack to seven games, while the head coach Holt still felt the taste of the loss since Kenny Miler replaced last month.
Livingston Loss the Opportunity Against Nursing Visitors
Holt's team should have been in charge a long time before they hit the gate, since their direct play style caused Rangers any problems.
Scott Robinson broke through protection, but his efforts raged in front of the gate, where Alan Lithgow made efforts to capture Craig Halketti's upper gate.
The hostess allowed Rangers to play in front of themselves, knowing that they could cause problems in certain places.
And that's also the way the goal gate was struck.
Rangers created a release and Livingston had an opportunity to play with Declan Gallagher, Robinson and Men who took the ball and succeeded in the middle of the prison area.
By then, the Rangers mainly held the ball, but failed to penetrate the protection, so the goalkeeper Liam Kelly side was mostly calm.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the gate once.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor pushed Scott Pittman's hit and Lithgow brightly shined in another team of Livingston.
The blows continued to reach the Livingston Penitentiary Area and were consistently hit there, and two of them were also directed away, one of them for the attempt to replace the Halketti Glenn Middleton and the other for touching the ball with his hand.
Fenomenal achievement from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland Allasdair Lamont Tony Macron Stadium
Phenomenal performance and outcome from Livingston.
Each player was great, exceeding the expectations on the ladder by moving upwards.
Their gameplay and players have barely changed since their peak-level return, but Holt must be praised for the way he has punished the team since the arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, organizing an excellently organized protection, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worralt on the back legs throughout the game.
The Rangers had no inspiration.
Regardless of their being at a good level under Gerrard's leadership, it was scarce according to these examples.
Their last possession of the ball proved incomplete: the arrival of the home side was only once that could function as an alarm clock for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Erdogan’s controversial reception in Cologne
In Berlin, on Saturday (29 September) there were both smiles and worry clouds when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have been left out on issues relating to human rights, freedom of press and accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan Kölni went to open a new giant mosque.
The largest Turkish community in the city is outside Turkey.
The police referred to security by prohibiting 25 000 members from gathering in front of the Mosque, but a number of supporters appeared near it to see their president.
Hundreds of people against Erdogan, many of whom are deaf, also made their voices heard, condemned Erdogan’s policy and the decision of the German government to host the Turkish President in their country.
The fighting demonstrations show that the attitude to the guest is divided: a Turkish living in Germany welcomes him as a hero, while others despise him as a self-rule.
Traffic accident on Deptford Road: the cyclist died as a result of a collision with the car
In London, a biker hit the car.
The crash took place near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, Southeast of the city at 10:15 p.m. by British summertime.
The driver stopped and the help arrived to provide ambulance doctors, but the man died at the scene.
The crash occurred a few months after the second cyclist died nearly two kilometers from the Saturday accident on Childers Street, where the driver who ran to the rider fled the scene.
The London police said the authorities are dealing with the identification of the man and the information of his loved ones.
Traffic is closed and buses are redirected, motor vehicle drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six prison officials were injured in unrest
The prison office reported that six prison officials were injured in some very security in the men's prison.
Peace broke out in the prison of His Majesty Long Lartin in Worcestershire on Sunday at 09:30 p.m. after the British Summer Age and has not yet ended.
A single wing of unrest associated with eight prisoners is involved in the handling of expert rebel police officers.
Prison officials were treated with milder facial injuries at the scene.
The prison ministry spokesperson said: “Employees with special training have been invited to resolve the ongoing case in HMP LongLartin Prison.
Five crew members received medical attention due to injuries.
We will not tolerate any violence in our prisons, they will be handed over to the police and their prison sentences may be extended.
HMP Long Lartini has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was taken to hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
In October of last year, however, the rebel police were called into prison to silence serious riots during which prison officials were attacked with pilot balls.
Orcan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden shocks (orgy can be useful for the origins)
The tropical low pressure does not hit Arizona often, but it will probably happen at the beginning of the next week, when the raging hurricane Rosa moves across the U.S. southeastern desert, bringing a sudden risk.
The National Weather Service has already organised sudden tracking in the western and eastern parts of Arizona, the south and east of Nevada, California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to the prediction, Rosa is heading directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the area on Monday with rainfalls.
The Phoenix National Air Service said that, “from 1950 alone, only ten tropical cyclones have preserved a tropical storm or low pressure level within 32,8.26 kilometers of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was an hurricane that passed 64.37 kilometers from the border of Arizona.
The latest national hurricane center models predict a rainfall of 5,08 to 10,16 centimetres, which can reach Arizonas Mogollon Rim in restricted areas up to 15,24 centimetres.
In other desert areas of the U.S. north, including the central part of the Kaljumäe, and in the large area, the number of rainfalls is likely to be 2.54 to 5.08 centimetres, ranging from restricted areas to 10,16 centimetres.
The rainforests of Rosa can be a blessing to the emerging tolerant areas, as the region suffers from drought.
Although flooding is very worrying, such rainfall is also likely to be beneficial, as droughts prevail in South America.
According to the U.S. branch monitor, at least 40% of Arizona’s extreme, or the second largest, drought, was reported by Weather.com.
First, the hurricane crosses the Rosa Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which was still in the morning of Sunday with the largest windmills at the Orcan level, is now 619.95 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, moving at a speed of 19.31 kilometers per hour to the north.
The storm is in contact with the cooling waters of the Pacific Ocean, and therefore it is a bit subdued.
Therefore, it is expected that Rosa will arrive on Mexico's land with a tropical storm strength in the afternoon or afternoon.
The number of rainfalls in certain regions of Mexico can be high, leading to a significant risk of flooding.
“Baja from California to Sonora’s northwestern part can be expected to have rain laws with a total of 7,62 to 15,24 centimetres, ranging from approximately 25,4 centimetres to 25,4 centimetres,” weather.com said.
Then Rosa is heading north of Mexico's tropical storm, reaching the border of Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure force that moves across Arizona and reaches the south of Utah on Tuesday night.
“The risk that follows Rosa or its consequences is very strong rainfalls in Baja California, the northwestern part of Sonora and the desert of the eastern part of the United States,” said the National Orcano Center.
These rainlights can cause life-threatening shocking and flooding in deserts and picturesque mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests related to the attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for a planned murder after a 16-year-old boy in Somerset was found.
A teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Sunday at 04:00 British summertime.
The victim was taken to a stable hospital.
A 17-year-old, 18-year-old and 20-year-old were arrested at night in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset, the police said.
Officials are asking to contact anyone who may have mobile phone recordings.
Trump said that Kavanaugh was carrying “Democratic Party under History and Hate”
“The support of the Commissioner Kavanaugh is a voice against the relentless and unacceptable tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in his inspiration speech in Wheelingus West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh was “taken by him during his appointment process under the “reality and anger” of the Democratic Party.
Kavanaugh gave testimony to Congress on Thursday, rejecting the charges of Christine Blasey Ford that he attacked him several decades ago when they were teenagers.
He also issued a certificate of his charges at the hearing for Ford.
On Saturday, the president said that “America saw the glory, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.”
The voice given to the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is to appoint one of the most prestigious lawmakers of our time who have an impeccable background in public service,” he told the support group of the West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of the Republic's electoral activity in the arbitration elections.
“Five weeks have remained one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm actually a candidate,\" he said.
“I am everywhere to fight for excellent candidates.”
Trump claimed that the Democrats are on a mission aimed at \"resisting and preventing\"
The first main procedural vote on the Senate’s floor on Kavanaugh’s application is expected to take place on Friday at the latest, said to the senior CNN of the presidents of the Republican Party.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have killed thousands, the number of deaths is rising.
At least 384 people were killed and many threatened when the giants invaded the beach after a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawes in Indonesia, the authorities announced on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had come together on Friday to the beach festival in Palu City, when during the time of the day, they created six-metre waves on the beach, killing a lot of people and destroying everything that remained on the road.
The tsunami followed 7.5 magnetic earthquakes.
“When the tsunami threat occurred last night, people still made their actions on the beach and did not escape immediately, staying as victims,” said the Indonesian spokesman for disaster relief, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at the press conference in Jakarta, Indonesia.
\"Tsunami did not come alone, but took along cars, logs and houses, sweeping everything from the earth,\" Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved at a speed of 800 km per hour before the shore.
Some people climbed out of the tsunami to escape the trees and survived, he said.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to Palu 24 headquarters.
The air photos published by the Disaster Board showed a number of destroyed buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges and water-based mosques.
The trackers in the coastal town continued on Saturday.
In the area of 2.4 million inhabitants, there was a wave of earthquakes.
The Indonesian Department of Technology Assessment and Implementation (BPPT) said in his statement that on Friday, the energy released after a strong earthquake was nearly 200 times higher than the nuclear bomb destroyed in the Second World War in Hiroshima.
The geography of the city on the edge of the long and narrow bay could increase the strength of tsunami, said BPPT.
Nugroho described the damage as “excellent” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels have collapsed.
He said that the bodies of some victims were found under the ruins of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said that the number and damage of the dead could be greater in the coastal area 300 km north of Palus, called Donggala, which was closer to the summer of the earthquake.
The reports from Donggala “are completely incomplete and do not contain any information,” Nugroho said.
“There are more than 300,000 inhabitants in the district,” the Red Cross said in his statement, adding that his team and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy that can get worse,” he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not informing the tsunami in the city of Palu, although the authorities said the waves reached the beach at the same time as the warning was issued.
The amateurs in social media have seen a man on the upper floor of a building who warns people on a panicous street for a tsunami approaching people.
Minutes later, the water wall arrives on the beach, carrying houses and cars with it.
Reuters failed to confirm the accuracy of the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a large-scale power break that prevented the link in the Palu region and made it difficult for the authorities to organise rescue work.
The military has begun to send aid aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but evacuations still urgently need food and other basic supplies.
The airport in the city was re-opened for rescue work, leaving the rest closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of people killed by the Indonesian tsunami increased by more than 800.
It's very bad.
Although the World Vision staff from Donggalas reached the city of Palu safely, where they were shadowed in the precentres erected in the courtyard of their office, they saw the sightings on their way, said Mr. Doseba.
“They said you saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Although the aid forces began a strong disaster relief operation, part of the fact that the workers of foreign aid organisations with great experience prevented travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian rules, foreign funding, stocks and aid forces can only be sent if an accident is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster at the level of the province,” said Aulia Arrian, Indonesia’s spokesman for the Red Cross.
“When the government says, “Okay, it’s a national disaster, we can start accepting international aid, but we haven’t yet declared such a state.”
When the second night of Palus arrived after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and families of the missing people were still full of hope that their loved ones are the wonderful events that alleviate the gloom of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was raised to the canal.
On Sunday, the saviors released a woman who was trapped two days next to her mother's body under her fists.
Indonesian National Sliding Guard Team Coach Gendon Subandono trained two lost Slidingeguards for Asian games that took place in Indonesia at the beginning of this month.
The rest of those who are trapped at Roa Roa Hotel are his students, Mr. Mandagi added.
“I have a personal burden as a senior slag shelter,” he said.
Mr. Gendon told us about how, after the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu’s competitors who were at the beach festival.
His messages were only marked with one grey bird instead of two blue birds.
“I think that means the messages didn’t arrive,” he said.
The thieves took 23 585,88 euros during the execution of the ATM in Newport on the Level
On Friday morning, the thieves stole EUR 23 585.88 from the British employee who completed the Levees ATM, the Newport Police Department Press release.
The driver emptyed the ATM and the manufacturing facility to bring more money, written by detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
When the man acted, “the other man was running behind the Brink employee’s back and stole a bag that was full of money for delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, wrote a press release, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the early persons will be asked to contact the Newport police on phone (+01633) 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper takes his new name Ye
Dirty Kanye West makes its name Ye.
On Saturday on Twitter, the man wrote: “The Ancient Kanye West
The 41-year-old West has been called Ye for a while, and the man also used the name as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The amendment will take place before his presentation on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to publish his new album in Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grandet, who canceled his concert on “the season of feelings,” said the author.
In addition to the fact that this is a short name for a man’s present name, West has said in advance that it is a word of religious significance for him.
“I think that “ye” is one of the most widely used words in the Bible, which means “you,” West said earlier, discussing the name of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“But I am you, I am us, they are us.
I changed my name from Kany, which means \"one,\" called Ye, which is just reflection of our good and bad, our confusion and everything else.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
Kanye West is not the only rapper to play with his name.
Sean Combs is mainly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year the musician announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously worked with West, has also used its name with a sense of meaning and without it, with large and small stars.
Mexican politician AMLO promises not to use military forces against civilians
At a time when the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the attacks on students, Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised that he will never use military forces against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Sunday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use military forces to control the Mexicans.
The military attacked a peaceful protest on the field on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people during the entire Latin America to confirm the student movements of the left.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans, paying students monthly allowances and opening more free national universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities will attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the financing of artificial intelligence.
“Since China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount allocated to research in this area,” said Kai-Fu Lee, a funder and artificial intelligence specialist who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were published after various parts of the U.S. government made statements on artificial intelligence, although the U.S. does not generally have an official strategy for artificial intelligence.
At the same time, China introduced its plan to be the maker of the upgrade of artificial intelligence by 2030 last year.
“The doubling of the artificial intelligence research budget would be a good start, taking into account that other countries are so far behind the US and we are acting on behalf of the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
Double funding would double the likelihood of the next major artificial intelligence achievement in the United States, said Lee CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinnovation Ventures, which funded one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with an artificial intelligence system that won the best Othello player in the United States. Later, he was at the board of Microsoft Research and president of Google’s Chinese branch.
Lee recognised the previous US government’s technology competitions such as the US Department of Defense’s Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge and asked when the next competition would take place to help identify the next dreamers.
“The U.S. scientists need to work hard to get government funding,” Lee said.
“The Chinese is not the one who takes over the educated, they are companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired brilliant researchers from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could help the US to support artificial intelligence efforts.
“I think people who have received a doctorate in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offered a green card,” he said.
The Chinese State Council published the next generation of AI development plan in July 2017.
“The Chinese National Science Fund shares funding to people working in academic institutions, similar to how the National Research Fund and other government agencies allocate money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a connected Artificial Intelligence Centre, which aims to involve partners from both industry and educational institutions.
This month, DARPA announced that it started to fund an initiative of $2 million in AI Next.
But the National Research Fund finances over $100 million per year in research related to artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the U.S. legislation has not been amended to establish a National Security Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
The Macedonians vote in a referendum on the amendment of the state name
During the Sunday referendum, the Macedonians voted on whether to change the name of the country into the Republic of North Macedonia. This would be a step that would also resolve the tens of decades of dispute with Greece, which has prevented the confirmation of applications for accession to Macedonia to the EU and NATO.
Greece, with the name of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbours constitutes a requirement for that territory and has prohibited Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
In June, the governments of the two countries agreed on the new name of Macedonia, but the opponents claim that the name would harm the national identity of the Slavic people of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he was not going to vote for the referendum, and that he had raised doubts as to whether electoral activity would achieve the 50% rate of participation required for the referendum.
The referendum asks: “Do you support the accession of Macedonia to NATO and the EU by agreeing to the agreement with Greece?
The supporters of the amendment, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price paid by Macedonia, one of the countries that have been established since the collapse of Yugoslavia, to ensure accession with organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of our country and for the young people of Macedonia so that they could live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, who was 79 years old in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have said that they will follow the result of the vote to make it decisive.
Two-thirds of Parliament is required to change its name.
The National Electoral Committee said there were no reports of irregularities at 13.00 p.m.
However, electoral activity was only 16 per cent compared to the previous 2016 parliamentary elections 34 per cent when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said the 62-year-old Gjose Tanevsky, who voted in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko gave Strumica his vote on the amendment of the name of the country, which would give them the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018.
A 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage in front of the Parliament building in Skopje, raising a chair in front of tents for those who ignore the referendum.
“We want to belong to NATO and the EU, but we want to join our head up, not through the door of the servants,” Kavatarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become European-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring more than 20% of the investment needed in Macedonia.
“I believe that a large majority supports the change of name because more than 80 percent of citizens are in favour of belonging to the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after giving his vote.
He said, \"Yes\" would be \"a confirmation of our future\".
The results of the survey published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Studies on Monday revealed that the referendum intends to take part in 30 to 43% of voters who are under the necessary electoral activity.
A survey conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV revealed that 57% of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said, \"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
The success rate of the referendum is 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would constitute the first serious blow to the government's Western policy after the government took over the government in May last year.
See: Manchester City Player Sergio Aguero goes to the gate for the sake of the entire Brighton protection
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling invaded Brighton's defense, ensuring Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made the impression like his 65th-time goal came ridiculously easily.
The Argentinian attacker passed through the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He invaded three Brighton defenders before reaching the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He invaded another defender before running along the border of a number of players at Brighton Penitentiary.
Then he hit the ball on the left where Sterling was.
An English attacker used the first blow to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right leg to beat Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew Ryan on the right side of the network.
“Aguero has problems with his feet,” said the Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola reporters.
“We told him he was playing at 55 or 60 minutes.
This is what happened.
We were lucky that he hit the gate at the moment.
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues an initial success in the defeat of Premier League.
The gate was hit in 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball in this game clearly in Brighton's territory.
He sent the ball out of the air to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane was able to hit the ball a few times before he led Sterling further.
Sky Blues hit the ball on the net just before it slipped out of the border.
Manchester City plays with Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 Rhein-Neckari Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the cheerleader against Rockies.
When the Nationals left the final tournament, there was no reason for the new start.
However, Scherzer is hoping to do this on Sunday with the land of Colorado Rockies, but only when Rockies, who runs one of the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, is still hoping to get to the final.
Rockies guaranteed a minimum of 5 to 5 winnings on the Nationals on Friday evening, but the team still wants to secure its first division.
“While we’re not playing for anything, we can at least try, knowing that playing in the atmosphere of this audience and another team in Denver is probably higher than any other game that can wait for me this year.
Why should I not want to compete here?
Nationals have not yet called the opening player from Sunday, but they are supposed to tend to the Scherzer meal in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be 34th feeding, made a hot tub on Thursday and feed on Sunday normally.
This Washington right-wing player runs 18-7, with ERA being 2.53, with the number of outlets 300 and favorable opportunities for his 220 2/3 this season.
Trump's in Western Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding the election to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of the Republic’s electoral activity in the arbitration elections.
“All we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lifetime.
It's a big event I'm not looking for, but I'm actually looking for, so I'm everywhere to fight for great candidates,\" he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, extremely terrible extremist group of Democrats, you see it happening in front of your own eyes.
And they have decided to take back power using any means. You see their meanness and dirty game.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to drive over for power and control. The only thing they want is power and control over everything, and we don’t give them it.
Democrats are in his claim to be on a mission that aims to “seek against and prevent”
“And you have seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “wild, wicked, humble, and false.”
He referred to Senator Diane Feinstein, a member of the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, who shouted out loud among the audience.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak this document?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, wait – it was one of the worst examples of body language, in fact the worst language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a big connection.
This is unacceptable for those who express their opinion.
When my local party's Momentum activists voted to condemn me, it wasn't surprising.
After all, I am the last one on the list of members of the bakery to be told that you are not welcome, and that is all for the publication of your opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was a part of the same treatment because he was strongly opposed to the Jews.
In my case, those who condemned me for not accepting Jeremy Corbyn.
Responsible economic policy, national security and European issues, which are strangely similar to those of which Jeremy also disagreed with previous leaders.
Nottingham's report of the Eastern Labour Party stated that \"we would like the meetings to be inclusive and formed\".
In most cases, my eight-year-long experience with the meetings of the general assembly of Friday evenings is exactly the same.
As of today, it is no longer valid for most meetings and the promise to be “severeer and generous” in politics has long been forgotten when it was never remembered.
It is increasingly evident that different perspectives are not acceptable in the Labour Party, and for each opinion, it is assessed who is acceptable to the party's board.
It started shortly after Jeremy became a leader. A co-worker with whom I thought I was to share similar political views, now expected me to change my mind and take on the views I would never have agreed otherwise, regardless of whether it was a matter of national security or the EU single market.
Every time I step up openly, regardless of what I'm actually talking about, following this condemnation in social media, encouraging my rejection, ignoring party politics, and saying that I shouldn't be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my personal experience.
Indeed, I know that I have been more lucky than some of my fellow workers, because my comments are mostly political.
I admire the competence and judgment of the fellow workers who face sexist or racist abuse every day, but never swear.
One of the most disappointing positions in this policy area is how the levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that a Leiborist party should promote a tolerance culture.
The reality is, however, that we are no longer such a large association and that every \"independence\" initiative or election rule becomes more narrower.
I’ve been given a lot of advice over the last two years to keep my head down, talk less, and “it’s all right. . . .
But that's not what I'm going to do in politics.
From the moment that I joined the Leiborist party 32 years ago, motivated by the care of the Government of Thatcher, which had left my great school classroom literally on the edge of collapse, I have tried to speak for better public services to those who need it most, acting as a minister of the local council.
I never hid my policy, including in the last elections.
In no case is it possible that no one in Nottingham East was confused about my political views or issues of non-consumption with the local leadership.
To all those who promoted the movement on Friday, I would like to say that if the country is moving towards Brexit, which damages households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend my time and energy as a loyal leader of the Leiborist Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is intended for Nottingham Momentum, but for my supporters, whether they belong to the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that not one threat or political consideration will stop me from acting on behalf of what I think is in your best interests.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: the undefeated Ayr is moving to the top
Two recent events may have been somewhat tilted, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to be won in this wonderfully fun Tennessee first league game.
They are now the only unbeatable team on the front of the table.
After all, it was a high level of protection and better risk taking of the team, which led to home team victory and coach Peter Murchiel has the full right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested all the time during the games and we’re still unbeatable, so of course I’m happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie Melrose said: “Pean Ayrist’s story, they used their chances better than ours.
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, taken over by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr a success, but the Scottish captain, Roy Hughes, who was given the yellow card to play Warriors, gave Melros the opportunity to do the failed experiment by Jason Baggot.
Climo increased Ayri’s progress with a penalty strike just before the end of the half-life, reaching a stand in favour of Ayri at the end of the one-half-time event.
But Melrose started the second half-time successfully and Patrick Anderson's experiment, which was taken over by Baggot, reduced the difference by five points.
Then a long delay took place due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, after which the man was taken out of the canderam. By continuing the game, Ayr's successes increased further thanks to the Stafford McDowall experiment, which was transmitted by Climo.
Ayri's CEO Blair Macpherson was then on a yellow card, but again, Melrose's player paid for Bruce Colvine's attempt to move after strong pressure.
However, the team playing at home gathered strength again, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for blocking Climo without a ball on the line of punishment, he put the MacPherson ball behind the progressive Ayrs.
Climo gave the ball forward, as he did almost immediately after the game was continued, when Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's box and sent the side guard Gregor Henry to go home to the team playing in the fifth test.
Still Game Star wants to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game Star Ford Kieran appears to be ready to enter the field of hospitality after he was discovered to be appointed director of a recognised restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvi in a famous BBC television series, which he writes and plays with a long-term comedy partner Greg Hemphil.
A couple have reported that the next nine seasons will be the last of the series and it seems that Kiernan will make life after the new plans of Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but the source of the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan would like to enter the Glasgow-Furthering Restaurant.
“The sea is ours: without the sea border Bolivia hopes that the court will again open the way for them to the Pacific Ocean.
Marines patrol the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
Ocean blue flags floating over the buildings of the agency.
To naval bases from Lake Titica to Amazon, the lead is: “Meri is our right.
Recovering it is our duty –
Without the sea border in Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still alive. The same living desire is to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are sometimes the highest in the last decades, since Bolivia is awaiting a decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of negotiations.
“Bolivia is a spirit of momentum, unity and peace, and the country is naturally waiting for a good result,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a diplomat from Bolivia.
The Hulk Bolivists across the country will look at the decision of the international court on large screens, hoping that the Hague Court will decide in favour of Bolivia, after which Chile will be obliged to negotiate with Bolivia for decades to give the last independent road to the sea.
Bolivia's charismatic real-world president Evo Morales, who is expected to be re-elected in the next year, is under much weight in Monday's decision.
“We’re very close to returning to the Pacific,” he swore at the end of August.
Some analysts believe, however, that the court is unlikely to vote for Bolivia, or, if so, very little will change.
The United Nations authorities in the Netherlands do not have the power to surrender the territory of Chile and it has provided that the outcome of any negotiations is not determined.
The fact that the international court’s decision is made only six months after the final statement was heard suggests that it was not a “stricken case,” said Paz Zárate, a civil expert in international law.
And the further reasons for Bolivia may have made the situation worse over the last four years.
“The problem of access to the sea has been kidnapped by the current Bolivian authorities,” Zárate said.
Morales' wary beauty speech has lost all the rest of Chile's charity, he noted.
Bolivia and Chile continue to negotiate at some point, but after that, the debate is extremely difficult.
Two countries have not changed their delegates since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a representative of Bolivia in the Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making was unnecessary.
The Monday will give Bolivia a special opportunity to start a new era in the country’s relations with Chile – and the opportunity to “stop the gap of 139 years with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, one of the most well-known presidents in Latin America, used the maritime issue to express political concern.
\"Bolivia never gives up on her right to access the Pacific,\" she added.
“It’s a chance to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea said that the release of nuclear weapons will not take place until the country can trust the United States of America.
Foreign Minister of North Korea Ri Yong Ho said that his people would never give up on nuclear weapons first unless he could trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Meeting on Saturday.
He called on the United States to look at the promises made by the leaders of the competitors at the Singapore Summit.
He will comment on the matter while U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo almost seems to be starting nuclear diplomacy again over three months after a meeting with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un.
According to Ri, it is air stations that the U.S. continues to restrict and refuse to end the war with Korea.
Washington is cautious about such a statement if Pyongyang does not take the first important steps towards arming.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism that Pyongyang intends to seriously give up the armament that the country is likely to see as the only way to ensure its own safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to agree on the second summit between Kimi and Trump.
Paris Fashion Bars bring to the viewer a series of massive head coverings that bring to the buyers on their neighborhood shopping streets
If you want to increase your cybral collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you won’t have to look for it anymore.
During the summer season of 2019, designers Valentino and Thom Browne brought a series of weird head covers to the stage, which darkened the Paris fashion week.
High and unpractical hats will be fashioned this summer through Instagram, and these designers have sent their foot-and-mouthed creations to fashioners.
Valentino’s top work was a super packed beige hat covering the heads of models, which was decorated with a wide range of edges.
Other high-rise clothing included arbes, a wizard’s village and even an pineapple, but their goal is not to heat.
Thom Browne also showed a strange choice of masks, doing it just in time before Halloween.
Most of the colored masks were condensed mouths, so they resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high.
One part of the creation resembled the diving costume with air pipes and glasses, while the other resembled melted ice cream.
And if you're going to continue with the giant mural feeds, you're lucky.
Moegurud predicts that super large headgear can also reach your nearby shopping street.
The tall hats come right on the cover of La Bomba, which is a shoulder hat with a width of 60 centimetres, which has been seen in the head of all celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult trade mark, which created a highly unpractical cybara, was placed in the social media, sent to the fashioners another large piece of work – an shoulder coastal bag that is almost as large as the model with its wearing bikini.
The dark orange rafia bag, with a raffia and white leather, was the top piece of the 2018 Summer Collection of Jacquemus La Riviera in Paris for the fashion week.
Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL about the style of celebrities: “I look forward to seeing large cybars and beach bags on the shopping streets next summer. Since the designer has had such a great impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for very large clothing.
John Edward: Language Skills are Important to World Citizens
Scotland’s private schools have remained at the forefront of the academic excellence table and continued in 2018 with the following outstanding research results, which will strengthen personal and joint success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
These schools, where you learn more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), try to provide the best service for your students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare students for additional and higher education, their chosen profession and their place as world citizens.
As a educational sector capable of designing and implementing a program tailored to circumstances, we see that modern languages are still known in schools and desired subjects.
Nelson Mandela said: “When you talk to a person in a language understood by him, it will come to her head.
When you speak to him in his native language, it enters his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent test results, we see that the tables are first-hand languages with the highest rate of completion of the exams among private schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received a high score of A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students received an A in Mandarin, the same scores received 72% of German learners, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students.
This shows that Scottish private schools support foreign languages as vital skills for life, which children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Languages that are now among the choice of subjects are the same in the curriculum of private schools and other schools as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
The study conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 revealed that, among the reasons why it is difficult for employers to find workers for free jobs, 17% of respondents had a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly mandatory to prepare young people for their future work.
As more hopeful job offers require language skills, such skills in the global world become essential.
Regardless of the career choices made, the acquisition of another language gives a real advantage to a person in the future, as language skills are lifelong.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign citizens gives a competitive advantage to a multilingual person immediately.
According to a survey conducted by more than 4000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent of respondents speak no foreign languages well enough to hold this conversation. The only language with a double score was French with 15%.
Therefore, the financing of language learning is important to children today.
Skills in several languages, especially in developing countries, give children better opportunities to find a good job.
In Scotland, different languages are taught at each school.
Hulk School focuses more on classical modern languages, while other schools teach languages that are considered the most important in the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of the child, private schools always have the opportunity to choose between several languages taught by experts in their field.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares and equips children with the skills they need to achieve success, regardless of what the future will bring them.
It is no longer possible to deny that languages in a global business environment are vital to the future of the country, which is why it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be considered “international communication skills.”
Private schools continue to provide young Scottishs with choices, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish private school board.
LeBron makes his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The innovative admirers no longer have to wait to see LeBron James making his debut in Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the pre-Sunday opening game Denver Nuggets against San Diego.
But the number of his playminders still needs to be determined.
“It’s more than one and less than 48,” Walton Lakers said on the official website.
Lakers Reporter Mike Trudell's phrase that James is likely to play countless minutes.
After last week's training, James was asked about his plans for the six-player pre-season schedule of Lakers.
“I don’t need pre-season games to warm myself at this stage of my career,” he said.
Trump West Virginia election campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will start his election campaign event series in West Virginia tonight.
Trump’s first campaign event scheduled for the next week is five, including stops in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
At the same time as the approval vote stands until Trump decides to appoint to the free seat of the Supreme Court, he shall seek to increase support for the forthcoming interim elections, as the Republicans are threatened by the abolition of control at Congress after the vote in November.
What time is Trump's campaign event in West Virginia and how to watch it online?
Trump campaign event in Wheelingus West Virginia will take place on Saturday evening on September 29, 2018 at 19:00 on the east coast.
The Trump West Virginia campaign event can be viewed online via YouTube streaming.
Trump is likely to talk about the meetings of the High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh this week, which became tense about the allegations of sexual abuse. At the same time, the Senate’s confirmation has been suspended for a week until the FBI is investigating the matter.
However, the main objective of the campaign series is to help the Republicans to gather new momentum in November, facing difficult elections.
So President Trump’s campaign manager said that the five events that will take place next week are “to stimulate volunteers and supporters when Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of them belonging to the Senate and the House of Representatives,” Reuters said.
“A review of Congress is so important for the president’s agenda that Trump will travel to as many states as possible during the season of election campaigns,” said Trump, a spokesman for the campaign, who did not want to mention his name.
Today’s campaign event, planned to take place at the Wesbanco Stadium in Wheelinus, can bring supporters from “Ohiost and Pennsylvania” and be reflected in Pittsburgh’s media,” said West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is the second time Trump visits West Virginia in the last month. This is a state where he received more than 40 percent of voters’ votes in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Western Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is leading the rankings on the basis of surveys.
“For Morrisey, it’s not a good sign that the president has come to stimulate his results,” said politician Simon Haeder of the University of West Virginia, Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shares nerves by keeping hopes ahead of Sundays alone
After three unilateral sessions, the games that took place on Saturday afternoon were sometimes the ones that Ryder Cup needed.
The fluctuating turning point on the pendel is a completely fictional concept of sport, but players believe in it truly, especially in competitions like this here.
So, where do they think the turning point is right now?
“They led with six points that have now become four, so I think I can consider it a small turning point,” said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, it is clear, because it is managed by four points and there are 12 points in the game.
According to Spieth, Americans know that they don’t have enough wind in sails, but they have a lot of encouragement, especially in the face of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each received three of the four points.
Spieth has been a pedestrian for both tii and grin and shows an example.
These victory threats from the throat became more and more pronounced with each circle, shadowing the dominant pot, which would have led to the fourth match after the two of him and Thomas were on the ground.
His bag, which won the match on 15th, sent a similar cry that showed a man's belief that the Americans are not out of the competition yet.
“You just have to play more focused and worry about your match,” said Spieth.
This is the only thing players can do.
18 holes to leave a trail.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days have Ryder Cup on the undisputed stars of Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood
Europe’s strange but beloved couple is four out of four and nothing can go wrong.
“Moliwood was the only couple who didn’t hit the Bogey on Saturday afternoon, avoiding the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and on Friday morning.
This game and the way their energy flows to such a noisy crowd, when back there, strengthens the opinion that players who are fighting on Sunday, and that when the sun is over the Le Golf National, the most famous player to confirm the European victory is not possible as Fleetwood or Molinari.
Both of them are at the same time in different holes.
The story of Europe's glory is unprecedented.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did Sergio Garcia, four-ball hero this morning, a fast job when a man and Alex Noren were put together.
Bogey and the two doubles of the first nine dug the Spanish and Swedish into a hole so deep that they had no hope of digging themselves out of it.
On Saturday there is no one to help you out August.
Four-balls and couple games are extremely close to seeing just the relationships between couples, advice to each other, advice to each other, advice not received, and how the way can change in a moment.
Europe has been playing as a team far better and has been leading a strong success for the last few days, but this chair session showed that the U.S. team is divided into nerves, with some, especially Americans, to fight.
Europe is on the last day of Ryder Cup 10-5
Europe will have a great success the last day of Ryder Cup, following Saturday’s four-balls and couple games, to lead the United States to 10-5.
The great duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led two victories in front of the struggling Tiger Woods to raise their current score in Le Golf National to four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, who contributed two years ago to the preservation of the car lost in Hazeltine, reigned after the failure of the American side in the morning four-ball, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the pair game, winning two games, but they could not compensate for the deficit.
Jim Furyki needs eight points from Sunday’s 12 individual games to preserve a cup.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row. Together with Molinari, who is called the Molliwood after that dark weekend, they are the second pair who has won four points in Ryder Cup history in their fourth opening game.
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they continued in the same spirit, defeating Woods and American beginner Bryson Dechambeveel more firmly: 5-4.
Woods, who drag himself through two games on Saturday, showed a random shine, but now lost his 29 four-balls and a couple of 19 with seven losses in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested in the morning for four-ball, returned with partner Henrik Stenson to match the match, winning 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who is in the world’s first and third place.
Europe did not succeed, although the competition was held pleasant and windy from Paris to the south.
Three-time Grand Winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set two points for Americans on Saturday.
In four-ball they won a solid victory over 2-1 Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, returning later and winning the two openings in the pair game Poulter and Roy McIlroyd 4-3 after losing two openings.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history, the team has returned from a four-point deficit, going to single games, although the owner needs only five to preserve the Furyki half cup.
While two days are better at the second place, it seems after the Sunday counterattack that they will not succeed.
North Korea says that, “in no case, they will not be armed unilaterally because of the lack of trust.
The foreign minister of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the restrictions continued to deepen their distrust against the United States and that the country would not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
At the annual meeting of the World Organization, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea has taken “markable health measures” over the past year, such as the suspension of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of a nuclear test site and the promise to not spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“But we don’t see the United States answering it,” he said.
“Without the confidence of the United States, our country has no security certainty, and in such circumstances we are in no way willing to make ourselves one-sided first armed.”
While Ri reiterated the familiar complaints of North Korea regarding Washington's resistance to \"accompanies\" approach to nuclear weapons-free, under which North Korea was rewarded when he took gradual steps, it seemed important in his statement that he did not reject unilateral nuclear ceasefire, as Pjongjang has done in the past.
Ri referred to Kim Jong Uni and Donald Trump’s joint statement on 12 June at the summit between the President of the United States and the North Korean leader in Singapore, when Kim promised to move to the direction of “relief of the Korean Peninsula” and Trump promised North Korea security guarantees.
North Korea has sought the official end of the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also received calls for strict international restrictions on North Korea.
“The United States calls for “first, abandonment of nuclear weapons” and increases the pressure of restrictions to achieve their goal in a forced manner, even in response to the declaration of war ending,” Ri said.
“I think the limitations push us down on our knees are a dream for people who don’t know us at all.
But the problem is that the limitations continue to deepen our distrust.
Ri did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the meeting between the three leaders of Kimi and South Korea Moon Jae in the last five months and added: “If one of the parties to the issue of nuclear weapons were South Korea, not the United States, the issue of nuclear weapons in the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a stagnation.
Nevertheless, Ri’s speech was markedly different from last year’s when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the U.S. missiles’ approach to the U.S. continent was inevitable after “Mr. Paha’s President Trump called Kim’s suicide mission as a “missor.”
Last year, North Korea was fully praiseed to destroy Trump in the United Nations to take steps towards becoming armed, but added that there is still much to be done and that the restrictions must remain in force until the nuclear weapons of North Korea are abandoned.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timetable for this, saying: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should pay tribute to the measures taken by Pyongyang.
At the same time, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council Thursday: “The enforcement of the restrictions of the Security Council must continue vigorously and without failure until we can fully and permanently confirm the abandonment of nuclear weapons.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased the restrictions applicable to North Korea, trying to prevent the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met next to the United Nations General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, although the last trip did not go very well.
After meeting with Pyongyang in July, he said that progress had been made, after what North Korea condemned for just a few hours after “gangsterical demands.”
North Korea promised to destroy the missiles and nuclear complex at the meeting with Moon this month, if the United States would implement the \"conforming measures\".
He said that Kim had told him that, under the measures to be taken, Trump considered security guarantees in Singapore and the move towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn how to rest enough
This year, Harvard University offers a new course where students need to sleep more to fight with a growing aggressive culture, where they learn through a night-long learning marathon.
Students who love the world’s best university’s academics are often helpless when it comes to the basics of caring for themselves.
According to Charles Czeisler, a professional professor at Harvard School of Medicine and Brigham and the Women’s Hospital, this is the first one in the United States.
He encouraged the creation of a course after he held a speech on how sleep problems affect learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and asked me, ‘Why is it not until now that I am told in my last year of school?
He said no one has ever told him the importance of sleep – it made me look like a cardboard,\" he explained to the TV.
The course, which came to the curriculum for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic outcomes and also help improve their overall well-being.
Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and University Health Director Paul Barreira said that the university decided to take the course curriculum after finding that students were in serious trouble sleeping on the week of work.
The hour-long course includes a number of counter-active tasks.
In one part, a picture of the common image is presented. Students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books and explain the effects of caffeine and light on the impact of sleeplessness on sports outcomes and the importance of the practice that has formed sleep.
The second part explains to participants how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
The campus card, together with the counter-active symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily habits.
“We know that this does not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know about the impact of smoking cigarettes on health,\" added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, learning marathons at night are still proud, adding that modern techniques and increasing pressure for students mean, rather, that lack of sleep is still a growing problem.
“Supporting a high-quality sleeper should be a student’s “salruptcy” to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety,” he added. “It even helps to fight weight gain because lack of sleep puts the brain in a sense of hunger, constantly making the person hungry.”
A 19-year-old study in chemical and physical biology from California, Raymond So, helped Professor Czeisler to create a course after attending one of his classes in his first Harvard years.
Raymond said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to contribute to the creation of a university-wide course.
As a next step, he would like all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before joining a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students put the alarm clock on both sleep and wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of electronic screens and LED light, because it can damage their daily rhythm and cause problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga gate defeats Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered the result of another bad guest game when Dolly Menga hit by Steven Gerrard on the side, brought the 1-0 victory to Livingston.
The Ibrox side hoped to win its first guest win since February, when 4-1 St Johnstone was defeated, but Gary Holt's team only caused the second loss of Gerrard in 18 games as a leader, remaining eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership from Hearts.
Menga created its gate seven minutes before the Polish season and the poor readiness of Rangers could not recover from it.
The Rangers therefore fall to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third place, staying down to Hibernian with only one gate.
For Rangers, the problems may not have been over, because their attacker, Calum Spence, needed a head wound after he was hit with an object he probably had.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side that led to the Ayrist and Betfred Cup semifinal.
Holt, however, went on with the same Liv 11 who took a point from Hearst last week, and he would have been satisfied with how his well-educated boys suffocated their opponents every step.
Rangers may have been more dominant, but Livingston did much more with his ball.
They should have hit the gate in the second opening minutes when Menga's first shift sent Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's gate, but the half defender did not take advantage of his chance.
Deep Keaghan Jacobs release was then found by Captain Craig Halketti, but its defense partner Alan Lithgow was able to do only a wide arc hit in the back of the post.
The Rangers achieved control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in the last third of their game.
Alfredo Morelos felt sure that he would have been punished when he hit the game with Steven Lawless in 15 minutes, Judge Steven Thomson did not satisfy Columbia's complaint.
Rangers managed to target only two blows in the first half, but former Ibrox gatekeeper Liam Kelly did not feel worried about the main blow of Lassana Coulibaly or the Ovie Ejaria event.
Although Livi’s 34th-minute prom might have violated the rules of the game, no one can deny that they deserve it purely because of their performances.
Again, Rangers couldn't control Jacobs' deep heavy show.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball Scott Robinson, who kept the peace and chose Men who just took the plan to the end.
Gerrard acted in the meantime, replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. This shift almost paid off when the edge player split Morelos, but impressive Kelly tried to stop him.
But Livingston continued to attract guests to play exactly the type of game, as it was suitable for those where Lithgow and Halket picked up long balls.
Holt's side could have been promoted at the end of the day, but McGregor stood firm, blocking Jacobs before Lithgow hit the corner with a large arc.
The Rangers substitute, Glenn Middleton, once again applied for a penalty strike when he went to the door with Jacobs, which Thomson was not satisfied again.
Almanah: Geiger counter inventor
And now the page of our Sunday Morning Almanahhis: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago and LOENDADES ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm-Hans- Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. It was an invention that eventually led to a device known as a Geiger counter.
From the beginning of this science, Geiger also became a pop culture platform like in the 1950s, \"Coronado Watches,\" where they were apparently unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man: “What is this thing?
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When these earphones are applied, it is possible to hear the potina of the atoms that are separated from the radioactivity of minerals.
Evans: “Don’t tell me it’s just going to go on.
\"Hanss – Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name will continue.
A new cancer vaccine is capable of teaching the immune system – see – petur cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to \"see\" the Fraud cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to know about fraudulent cells as part of the treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing their cells in the laboratory
Then they can “see – a common protein for many cancers” and they are injected back.
The vaccine in the study shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches the detection of ovarian cells to the immune system disappeared from her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method includes the removal of immune cells from the patient. These cells are modified in the laboratory so that they can be ‘faced’ protein that is common in various HER2 cancers, and then re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute Bethesdas Maryland explained: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.
HER2 leads to the growth of many types of cancer, including breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal cancers, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach in patients taking immune cells and taught to target cancer cells has been used to treat certain types of leukaemia.
Kanye West began with Trump’s support tribe, wearing the SNL directly from the MAGA coin.
It didn't go very well.
You'll get Saturday Night Live in the studio, a debilitating wild cream on Kanye West, after his mixed speech, in which he congratulated US President Donald Trump and announced his nomination for the same job in 2020.
After that night his third song, named Ghost Town, and in which he wore a hat letter from Make America Great, began to present him against the same Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
“I’ve spoken so much to white people who ask me, “How can you like Trump, he’s racist?
“If I were so worried about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL started the device with Matt Damon, where Hollywood's fame made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Jury of Judges in relation to Christine Blasey Ford's alleged sexual violence.
Although this part of the show did not go on the air, the West noise detectors were loaded into the social media of Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to pry West.
He also complained to the West audience that he had quite a problem with his hat behind the scenes.
“They laughed at me behind the stage.
They said I wouldn't go in there with a hat in my head.
They were fooling me!
And then they say I've drowned in the place,\" he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see the sunken place? I put on my Superman chain, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love –
His comments fired the viewers at least twice, and it seemed that the SNL team was embarrassed. According to Variety, one person said: “All studios were still dead-death.
West was brought to the show at the last moment to replace Ariana Grande, because the singer's former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West was amazed by many songs, “I Love it, at which time he looked like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA from Candace Turner, who said: “To one bold soul: THE YEAR, THE REFUGE FOR THE REFUGE
But the Ambassador Karen Hunter said that the West was simply “the one who he is, and it’s completely amazing.”
“But I decided to reward MITTE (part of my music or clothing, or by supporting her “artism” – someone who I think believes and spreads a harmful world view to my community.
He's free.
Like us, he added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name, saying that he is now “the former Kanye West”
He is not the first singer to change his name by following Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also, rapper Snoop Dogg has named Snoop Lion and, of course, the newly divorced music legend Prince, who turned his name into a symbol.
Insulting the Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with a murder attempt after another man was stabbed on Friday at a restaurant in the east of Belfast.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrate Court on Monday.
The prosecution will be reviewed by public prosecutors.
The popularity of the Trojan game Kit Harington does not approve of the masculine
Kit Harington is well known for his sword-flaging role in Jon Snowina HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series of Trojans.
But the actor (31) expands the stereotype of the aggressive hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel they need to be tough.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit thought that “there’s been a mistake, and raised the question of how to solve the masculine problem of the bet in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie’s co-sumption of the Trojan game (31) admitted that he felt “systfully” that this problem needed attention.
“I feel personally right now that we’ve gone wrong with masculine somewhere,” he said.
“What we’ve taught men when they grow up is related to the problem we’re seeing now.”
Kit believes that the rise in the masculine of the bet is partly responsible for television, because there are super-manic figures.
He continued: “What is born and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets gives young boys the feeling that they need to be exactly the way they want to be men.
I think this is really one of the biggest questions of our time - how to change it?
Because obviously something has gone wrong for young men.
In the interview, he also admitted that, after the end of the series, no Troon game was ever played, saying that he was “one side with his battlegrounds and horses”
From November, Kit Sam Shepardi will participate in the revitalization of True West, a story about the filmmaker and his kidnapper brother.
The actor recently announced that he considers meeting his wife Rose to be the best thing to do with the Trojan game.
“I met my wife in this series, so it gave me my future family and my next life,” she said.
Rose played with Emmy as a fan of the award-winning fantasy series Ygritte, Kit's character song Jon Snow.
A couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces 14% increase in new cases
China has reported that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased to 14%.
According to health care professionals, more than 820 000 people suffer from this disease.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases have arisen from sex, making it so past.
HIV was readily transmitted by blood transfusions in some parts of China.
However, in this way, the number of people infected with HIV was almost zero, Chinese health officials confirmed at the conference in the province of Yunnan.
Since the year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 people in China.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but the distinction between LGBT people is alleged to be high.
The old-fashioned values of the state show that 70-90% of men having sex with men eventually marry women.
Many cases of disease are related to insufficient sexual protection of such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to use universal access to HIV medications to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the leaking of the GOP Senator’s data, saying that it is “hazardous lies and conspiracy theories.”
On Saturday, the US representative Maxine Waters condemned the claims that his employee had posted to the pages of the legislators the personal data of the three Republican Senators of the United States.
Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that such claims are distributed by “ultra-right-wing” trolls and their websites.
“Wats, lies, and even more despicable lies,” Waters said in his Twitter statement.
The published information reportedly included home addresses and telephone numbers for US Senators Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch (both Utahis).
The information appeared on Thursday. It had been posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate Panel in connection with the claims of sexual overshooting against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked shortly after three senators were questioning Kavanaugh.
Old-fashioned websites such as Gateway Pund and RedState reported that the IP address, which identifies the source of the post, was related to the Waters office and provided information to the employee under Waters, said Hill.
“This unjustified claim is a complete and absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“My employees, whose personality, personal data and safety are threatened by their fraudulent and false claims, shall not be liable in any way for this information.
This unjustified claim is a complete and irrevocable lie.
Waters’ statement was quickly calculated on the Internet, including one of the co-authors of former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is due to anger,” Flescher wrote.
“This suggests that he has a sense that is not suitable for a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something they haven't done, they can't get angry.
They must not be tropics.
They must not question the motives of the accuser.
They must remain calm.
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Also, the Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is applying for Waters in the interim elections, expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“It came to pass when it was true,” he said.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had warned “the relevant professional and law enforcement authorities regarding their fraudulent claims”
\"We all do to find out the criminals,\" he continued, \"and that they should be legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees,\" he said.
Film Johnny English Strikes Again Review - A Substantiated Rowan Atkinson Spy Parade
It is now a practice that Brexit's meanings are sought in all the new British films, and it seems to be particularly appropriate for Johnny English's mercenaries in the parody series, which began in 2003 with Johnny English, and became a sequel to Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Is it a humorous question of how foolish we are in the new country's export option?
In any case, the unqualified Johnny English has been given permission to do things once again in a tacky way - and that this wide comic creation is designed for non-English-speaking cinematographers.
Of course, it's a secret agent who, despite his strange pretentious sympathies, reminds me of Clouseau, a little Mr Bean, and a little character who gave a tone of Chariots of Fire at the London Olympic Games in 2012.
It is also based on a traveler and international mysterious Atkinson, who was once played in forgotten Barcelonacard’s television ads, leaving nothing but chaos.
There are only one or two pleasant moments in this last JE film.
I liked the Johnny English helicopter's approach when he wore a medieval iron rifle and the helicopter's winged his helmet for a while.
Atkinson's talent is shown to make a physical comedy, but humor appears to be less important and strangely excessive, especially when \"real\" spy movies such as 007 and Mission Impossible also offer self-confidence comedy.
It seems that this humor is more intended for children than adults, and for me, Johnny English's clever adventures are not as resourceful and focused as the Atkinson's dark movies Beanina.
Today, it is forever a prerequisite that Britain is in serious trouble.
The cyber hacker has penetrated the web network of super secret spyes in the UK, revealing the personalities of all British secret policemen, making it a great disappointment to the on-site agent - regretfully a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the prime minister, who is a solemn and troubled character who suffers from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does this for Teresa-May, but there is not much to work on in the manuscript.
His intelligence advisors suggest that since all active spies are threatened, he must call back someone who has retired.
And this means Johnny English, who is now working as a school teacher in a proud institution, giving a secret lesson about how to be a secret agent: here are a few good places where English offers the School of Rock-type spy school.
English is returned to Whitehall for emergency notification and is reunited with his former long-time partner, Bough, who is playing again with Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the master of the submarine, where actress Vicki Pepperdine's talents are seriously wasted.
So Batman and Robin, his Majesty's secret service, are operating again, meeting Olga Kurõlenko with a beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is dangerously falling under the arm of the charismatic engineering billionaire, claiming that he can solve all British computer shortages: the unfortunate Jason Volta, who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start with their thirsty odyssey: hiding themselves as performers, they put fire on the French restaurant; they create chaos, holding the secret Volta luxury yacht on board; and English launches a real mess when it tries to use a virtual reality headset to get acquainted with the interior of the Volta house.
In this last section, no brakes are used, but as sweet and stormy as it is, the whole thing has a children’s TV taste.
Very mediocre stuff.
And as with other Johnny English movies, I realized that the British film industry really doesn’t have to play a role that would be fair to his talent.
The Labour Party denies drawing up a plan where the British work for four days a week, but they are paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyni's Labour Party has considered a reverse plan, which states that the British will work four days a week, but will be paid for five days.
The party wants the executives of the company to pass on to the workers who have been saved through the Artificial Intelligence Revolution (AI), giving them one additional free day.
This would be a three-day weekend for the workers, but they would receive the same salary.
According to Allika, this idea would be compatible with the economic agenda of the party, and so the country is going to be tilted to the benefit of the workers.
The working week on Thursday has been approved at the Congress of the Trade Union in order to enable workers to exploit the changing economy.
The source of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “It is said that the draft review will be announced before the end of the year.
“This is not happening overnight, but Thursday’s working week is a struggle that is compatible with the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of both workers and the overall industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party is not the first to support such ideas, because the Green Party promised to work on Thursday during its 2017 election campaign.
However, the effort is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
The Labour Party spokesperson said: “There is no party’s policy on Thursday’s work week, and the party does not discuss it.”
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party Conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist shift in the economy.
McDonnell said that he has decided to take power back from the Communist companies – the visible leaders – and the profit-services –
The plans of the Deputy Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not be able to recover all their participation, as the Labour Party could do “declarations” in relation to perceived misdemeanour.
He confirmed his plan to put employees in company boards and to create equity funds to provide 10% of the private sector's equity to employees, instead of providing annual bonuses up to EUR 561,65.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak in the broadcast “60 Minutes – whether the FBI’s investigation of Kavanaugh can change their mind.
The investigation of charges against the FBI judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on the application to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the Bureau's findings could have an impact on the closure of the support of the Republican senators.
In a Sunday survey, you will be asked, “60 Minutes, the co-founder Scott Pelley of the Republicans from Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, whether the FBI could reveal something that could make them change.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
\"Of course,\" Kennedy said.
\"I said I'm going to the interrogation, and I said I've been talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges came out and asked him, \"Did you do it?\"
He was determined, firm and unambiguous.
Graham's voice seems to be on the cliff.
“I’m sure of my decision regarding Brett Kavanaugh and could only be changed in the bomb,” he said.
\"Dr Ford, I don't know how this happened, but I know Brett denied it vigorously,\" said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone he called could not confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new coming.
What is the Global Civil Festival and has contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, the New York Global Citizen Festival organizes an annual musical event with a tremendously impressive attendance of celebrities and the same impressive goal: to lose poverty from the world.
Now, the 7th-time Global Civil Festival sees tens of thousands of people in Central Park's Great Lawn not only enjoying singers such as Janet Jackson, Card B and Shawn Mendes, but also raising awareness of the real purpose of the event, namely ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Civil Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international law firm who hopes to end poverty by constantly increasing the number of people fighting it.
To get a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), concert guests had to perform a number of tasks or volunteering activities, send an e-mail to a world leader, call or do something else important to help raise awareness of their goal of the loss of poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been if there are still 12 years to achieve this goal?
Is the idea to give people a free concert a real way to convince them to take action, or is it just another click feature where people feel they are doing something important by signing an application online or by saying something?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has registered more than 19 million actions for its supporters, trying to achieve a number of different objectives.
According to this, these measures have helped world leaders to inform more than $37 billion of commitments and policies that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group referred to the 390 commitments and the Communication resulting from their activities and of which at least $10 billion have already been paid or financed.
The Group estimates that some 649 million people worldwide have so far been directly affected by secured funds.
Some of the main obligations include the partnership between investors and practitioners in the United Kingdom The Power of Nutrition, which is committed to “helping children take advantage of all their abilities” by allowing Rwanda to give $35 million to help stop malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 sentences from the Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens, as you do, we can turn malnutrition into a historical note of social injustice,” said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman to the crowd during the London concert in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after more than 5,000 activities that called on the UK to improve the diet of mothers and children, the government announced a funding project for The Power of Nutrition, which reaches 5 million women and children in need of nutrition intervention.
In response to one of the FAQs on our website asking, “which makes you think we can end extreme poverty.”
Global Citizen replied: “This is a long and difficult path – sometimes we fall and fail.
However, as we face great civil rights and anti-partheid movements, we are confident in our success because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae is just a few of the performers who will take up this year's event in New York, led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Marines - a barrier - to prevent Russian energy exports - the Minister of Internal Affairs
According to Washington Examer, Washington may use its naval forces if necessary to prevent the Russian energy market from being hit, including in the Middle East, by U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke.
Zinke claimed that Russia's participation in Syria, especially when it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for the investigation of new energy markets.
“I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to exchange energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, on the stomach of southern Europe,” he said.
And the official said there are ways and means to solve it.
“The United States has this opportunity by means of our Navy to ensure that sealines are open and blocked, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not go to the market,” he added.
Zinke's statement was directed to the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance event, which is a non-profit organisation that represents the voice of the US-energy consumer.
He went to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, indicating that they are essentially the same.
“The economic choice of Iran and Russia is more or less, leverage and fuel replacement,” he said, while referring to Russia as “one trick to the pony” whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when Trump's government's task is to increase exports of LNG to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, Trump’s administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to force the Germans themselves out of the “unfair” project – Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said changed Berlin to Moscow’s “conservation”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economical project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s acute response to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of publication of pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers,” said US Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak at a meeting in Moscow in September with US Minister of Energy Rick Perry.
The U.S. stance has become a feedback from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the German Employment Union (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a major problem when a third country intervenes in our energy supply,” said President of the German Industry Union (BDI) Dieter Kempf, who has recently met German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering candidateing for president in 2020, says Senator Massachusetts.
Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he was seriously considering candidateing for president in the interim elections.
At Holyoke's Town Hall, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering his application.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and improve our broken government, and it also involves the first lady,” he said.
“After November 6th, I am seriously considering running for president.”
Warren also assessed President Donald Trump’s activities at the Town Hall, saying that he “takes the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m really worried about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” he said.
Warren has published a criticism against Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren said: “I hope we need an FBI investigation before we vote.
However, the survey published on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s voters do not think he should apply in 2020.
According to a survey by Suffolk University’s political research centre/Boston Globe, 58% of the voters thought that the Senate should not apply.
32% supported such an application.
The survey showed more support for the candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick, 38% supported the possible application and 48% opposed it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed in connection with possible 2020 nomination include former Vice-President Joe Bident and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said it was officially decided by January, Associated Press announced.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palin PTSD at Donald Trump
Track Palin (26) spent the year recruiting from the Iraqi September of the year.
He was arrested on Monday night in connection with the domestic violence case and was charged with charges
“What my son lives through, what he experiences when he comes back, I can associate myself with other families who feel PTSD’s consequences and wounds that our soldiers return to,” he told Donald Trump in Tulsa.
Palin called for his son to be arrested “in an alien room,” and said in connection with his son and other war veterans, “they will come back a little differently, they will come back as punished, and they will come back thinking if there is enough respect for what the soldiers and the pilots and all the other militarymen have given to the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasillas Alaska and was arrested by a police officer, Dan Bennett, who said he was accused of domestic violence against a woman, in an intervention report on domestic violence and in a drunk state of possession of a gun.
The 18 states and the Columbia region challenge a new asylum policy
Eighteen countries and the Columbia region support the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that prohibits asylum for victims who flee from force or domestic violence.
On Friday, 18 representatives of the country and the region issued a brief statement of friends in Washington to support the policy of the asylum seeker, NBC News said.
The full name of the applicant, Grace v. Sessions smoke, which the American Civil Freedom Union presented in August against the Union policy, has not been published.
The woman said that her partner and her violent gang members’ sons abused her, but the U.S. officials did not accept her asylum application on July 20th.
He was arrested in Texas.
National lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries producing a large number of U.S. asylum seekers, among whom there is a major problem with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the 2014 decision of the Board of Appeal for Migrants, which allowed undocumented migrants to flee from domestic violence to submit asylum applications.
Karl Racine, the chief prosecutor of Columbia, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “supervises decades of national, Union and international law”
“The Federal Law requires that all asylum applications be resolved in accordance with certain facts and circumstances of the application and that such a claim violates this principle,” the court statement said.
The lawyers also argued in a brief statement that banning migrants from entering harming the US economy, saying that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and that \"need the necessary workforce\"
The Chief Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration court to no longer give asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
“The application for asylum is available to those who leave the country of origin because of persecution or fear in relation to race, religion, nationality, or a particular social group or political opinion,” the Session said in its communication of 11 June.
The purpose of asylum was never to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day.
Entertainment rescue operations in Palus, where deaths have doubled in the fight to find the survivors
The situation for survivors was increasingly threatening.
“The situation is very stressful,” said the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who comforted her fever at the evacuation centre of the town of Palu, a small boy.
“In every minute, new people will arrive with an ambulance.
There is not enough clean water –
The inhabitants returned to their destroyed homes, sorting through things and trying to save everything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals that had been damaged by a 7.5-magnet earthquake were inextricably burdened.
Some injured, including broken back and upper arm-damaged Dwi Haris rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients continued to be treated in the outdoors due to strong protrusions.
Pisaras filled his eyes when he remembered how a strong earthquake shook his fifth floor hotel room, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“It was time to save itself.
I think I had been pushed into the wall in front of the wall,\" Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they're not in danger.
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of bullying with “flashing ads”
A week after China’s official newspaper released four-page ads under the U.S. daily news regarding the daily benefits of U.S. Chinese trade, the U.S. ambassador accused Beijing for the use of American journalism in China to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the addition paid last Wednesday by China Daily in Des Moines Register - Iowa State with the largest tiara in the newspaper - after China was accused of intervention in US Congress elections on 6 November, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing attempted to intervene in US elections marked what U.S. officials described Reuters as a new stage in Washington's expanding campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to promote advertising trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war where each other’s import tariffs are adjusted.
The anti-China countermeasures at the beginning of the tariff war were intended to strike states such as Iowa exporters, as they supported the Trump Republican parties, Chinese and US experts have explained.
U.S. Ambassador in China and former Governor of Iowa, as well as China's largest exporter of agricultural products Terry Branstad, said Beijing damaged American workers, farmers and companies.
Branstad wrote in a Sunday Des Moines Register opinion article: “China has now doubled its bullying by publishing a press release in our free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the expensive freedom of expression and free journalism, placing its paid ad in Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, there are only limited voices in Beijing Street, and there are no truly different opinions that the Chinese people may have on China’s worrying economic direction, given that the media is firmly in the hands of the Communist Party of China,” he added.
He added that one of the most prominent newspapers in China refused to publish his article, but he did not say what newspaper it was.
Analysts warn that the Republicans host female elections before the interim elections with Kavanaugh fiasco
While many Republicans await and defend the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of multiple sexual attacks, analysts have warned that they will see a return during the upcoming interim elections, especially from women.
The feelings surrounding the situation have been in the ceiling and most Republicans have already shown that they want to go on voting.
“These things cannot be taken back,” said Maxwell, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse, Grant Reeher, in an article published on Saturday at The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts that the last minute attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) in connection with the FBI investigation is sufficient to calm angry voters.
“Women don’t forget what happened yesterday – they won’t forget it tomorrow or November,” said the senior adviser of the Progressive Group MoveOn on Friday, and the national representative, Karine Jean-Pierre Washington DC, according to the newspaper.
On Friday morning, the protesters, “The November is coming – at the demonstration of their Senate Corridor, because Republicans who control the committees of judges decided to proceed with Kavanaugh’s nomination, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, said Mic.
“Democratic induction and internal transport will be out of schedule,” said Stu Rothenberg, an informal political analyst.
“People say it’s already high, it’s true.
But it can be higher, especially among the female voters in the suburbs and the younger voters aged 18-29 who do not like the president and often abstain from voting.
Even before the public testimony of Ford, which described his claims of sexual assault against the candidate of the Supreme Court, the analysts predicted a return when the Republicans moved on with the confirmation.
“This has become very confusing for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“This is not only about the Commission’s vote, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is to be put in office, it also concerns how the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have treated it,” said President Guy Cecil, President of the United States of America (the group that helps Democrats choose) to pay attention to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be slightly divided, who believe in the testimony of Ford and those of Kavanaugh, but a little more by supporting the first.
YouGov’s new survey showed that 41% of respondents believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they would be sure or likely believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said that they thought Kavanaugh was probably or certainly lying during his testimony, while only 30% thought about the same Ford.
Thanks to Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other accusation of Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian said.
Ford admitted to the Senate Jury Committee last week that Kavanaugh attacked him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate of the Supreme Court showed him his genitals when they participated in a party in Yale during his studies in 1980.
World Wide Web inventor plans to start a new internet that would be on the front of Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of World Wide Web, launched a start-up company trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The last project of the technology legend Inrupt is a company that builds up the Berners-Lee open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have been given access to the information.
In an exceptional interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal was to “rule the world.”
“We need to do this now,” he said about the start-up company.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own “personal online database – or POD.”
It may include contact lists, task lists, calendar, music collection and other personal and competent tools.
This is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Black and Spotify, which are all available in one browser and simultaneously.
This personal online database makes it unique that the user can choose who can access this information.
It is referred to as \"for the granting of individual powers through data\".
According to John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is to bring sources, processes and relevant skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers who have been hired to work in the project under the contract, and a community of volunteer encoders.
Since this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralized apps using the tools on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not speak to “Facebook and Google,” whether to introduce a complete change when all of their business models are fully supported overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission...
In a post published in Medie on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s goal is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on the basis of Solid.
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Even when Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute will remain the founder and director of Berners-Lee World Wide Web.
“I’m extremely optimistic about the next era,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Bath: A spiritual memorial stone that was crucified by Victoria in World War I
The Church of England, who was baptized in the First World War, celebrated the 100th anniversary of its hometown.
Colonel-in-Chief Bernard Bath battled his badge on September 29, 1918 in Bellenglis and Lehaaucourt attack.
But he died four days later by the sniper's bullet and did not know that he had become the highest British army embroidery.
His two grandsons opened the memorial stone on Saturday in Northamptonshire in Russia.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it would be “genically symbolic” if the stone was opened exactly 100 years after the grandfather’s award-winning fight.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Vann directed his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentini on 29 September 1918 through a very thick fog and rifles and ball bearings.
Later, he rushed to the line of attack and carried it on with the greatest galaxy, before he rushed to one of the machine guns alone, and struck three opponents.
Colonel-in-Chief Vanni killed German sniper on October 4, 1918 - when only a little more than a month was left until the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather’s activity was “Nothing I know I can never repeat, but for which I will always be grateful.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann set up a house after a parade led by Brentwood's conservative youth band.
Michael Vann said that he has “a great honour to participate in this parade” and added that “the presence and support of so many people shows that the real hero is able to evaluate.”
The MMA fans were at the top of the night to watch Bellator 206, but only saw Peppa in Põrsa
Imagine that you've been up all night to look at Bellator 206, but this main event will not be shown to you.
The San Jose match included 13 battles, including six from the main map, and was shown on the 5th channel in the UK for a full night.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to pull each other's breasts, the UK viewers had their mouths on their backs, because Põrsa Peppa appeared on the screen.
Many had not been impressed by it, especially those who had been awake until early hours to see this fight.
One fan described the transition to the children’s comics on Twitter as “a joke that hurts me”
“This is the government’s regulation that at 6.00 the content was no longer suitable and they had to switch to the children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Bellator on marketing and communications issues when asked about the transfer.
“Peppa in Hell, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Bellator President Scott Coker said they were going to work on their schedule to take more into account UK viewers in the future.
“When I think about the re-representation, I think we can solve this problem in the future,” Coker said.
“But if it’s at 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, we can’t do it until Sunday, which is their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, there was much back and forth, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical disorder.
But it wasn't, it was a government rule.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
Instead of six fights, we show a reference - as we usually do - trying to give more to fans and we just went over time.
This is a serious situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt himself in connection with sexuality as “subvalued”
The Olympic winner, Tom Daley, says that he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but it gave him motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old man said he didn’t understand until he went to high school that “Nobody was like him.”
By participating in Lauren Laverne Radio 4, Desert Island Discs, he said he was talking about homosexual rights to give others hope.
She also changed her attitude towards winning Olympics, giving her the feeling that it is no longer so important.
You’ll be a regular long-term escort to Kirsty Young for his illness to take a few months off.
In Laverne's first show, Daley told me that she felt less valuable when she grew up than others, because it wasn't socially acceptable if you liked boys and girls.
He said: “Until today, these feelings are that I am not worthy and feel different, gave me power and strength to be successful,
He wanted to prove that he was “anything worth it, nor let others be disappointed when they finally found out about sexuality.”
The two-time bronze Olympic winner has become a highly regarded leader of the LGBT campaign, using his appearance to the Games of the People's Community of this year in Australia to turn to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was talking about it because he was lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and want to give hope to others.
Three times the world champion said that falling in love with a man - the American filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - “he surprised him as a surprise.”
Daley married a 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said that the difference between age was never a problem.
“When you’re so young, he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, it was difficult to find someone the same old who had experienced similar heights and scales.
A couple became parents in June, they have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his “all perspective” had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning the gold medal,” he said.
“But you know, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie
His son was named after his father Robert, who died at the age of 40 in 2011, after the diagnosis of the brain tumor.
Daley said his father refused to die and one of the last things he asked about was whether they had tickets to London in 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him that, “Father, you can’t sit in the front row, because by then you’re not there anymore,” he said.
“I kept his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he had actually stopped breathing and died, I finally admitted that he was not undefeated,” he said.
The next year, Daley competed in the Olympic Games in 2012 and won the bronze.
“I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life – diving in front of the home crowds in the Olympic Games, there’s no better feeling of it,” he said.
It also inspired his first selection of songs - Heather Small Proud - which helped him prepare the Olympic Games and still creates a chicken skin for him.

Mickelson was removed from the game on Saturday at Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson makes a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to improve his form to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who plays a record 12 times every two years, was removed from the game by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's match and four-ball.
Instead of being at the centre of action, as it has often been for the U.S., the five-time winner divided his day into two, being an incentive and working on his game, hoping to improve it.
Never the most direct hitter, not even at the peak of your career, is a 48-year-old especially suitable to play on a narrow Le Golf National golf course where a long rough track punishes constantly lost punch.
And if the field itself is not scary enough, Mickelson will stand on Sunday, in his ninth competition against the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined forces with the beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four races this week.
If Americans who are behind the top 12 singles at the beginning of the game start on fire, the Mickelson competition can be extremely important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, but he did not have much more to add.
“He fully understood his part today, put me on his shoulder, put his hand around my shoulder, and said he was ready for tomorrow,” Furyk added.
“He’s very confident.
He is a celebrity and he has given so much to our teams both in the past and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I saw more, but it went like this, and we had to choose such a path.
He wants to be outside like everyone else.
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record on Sunday as the most active player in Ryder Cup games.
This may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which has never responded to his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses, and seven weeks, but Furyk said that his presence has given the team a further spiritual contribution.
“He’s funny, scoffing, funny, he likes to have fun with people and he’s just great in the team room,” he explained.
“I think younger players had a lot of fun on their way to him this week and it was great to see it.
He offers much more than just a game.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great success can soon disappear.
The European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows from his experience that Ryder Cup’s last day’s great leadership at the start of the single games can easily become an unpleasant experience.
The renaissance came to the public in the 1997 competition in Valderrama, where five-point success countries were held in front of the Americans with Captain Seve Balleseros, but over the finish line it was dramatically degraded, and the victory was only won with results 141-2: 131-2.
“You will even remember that we had a great leadership position in Valderrama; we also had great success in Brookline, where we lost and in Valderrama, where we won, this victory came very little,” said Bjorn in the picture after the Class of 2018 won 5 : 3 Friday and the success of 10:6 Le Golf National.
So history shows me and the whole team that it can happen again.
You're going to do your best tomorrow.
You go out and do the right things.
It's not over until you've got the points.
We have a goal to win the Cup and therefore focus on it.
I’ve always said I’ve been focusing on 12 players who are on our side, but we’re very aware of who’s against us – the best players in the world –
Being content with how his players have played on this tough golf course, Bjorn added: “I’m not going to rush into things.
Tomorrow it is a completely new obstacle.
Tomorrow we read personal performances, so it's different.
It's nice to be with a opponent when things go well, but if you're there in person, you're being tested as a golfer.
This is the message you need to send to the players - give yourself the best tomorrow.
Now that you leave your partner, he also has to go and take care of himself.
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk expects his players to act better personally than with opponents, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who received three of the four points.
Furyk himself has experienced both of these last days, being part of Brookline's victory team before becoming part of the defeat when Europe defeated the \"Medinah's miracle\".
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to the question of how in 1999 Captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged his players to put all their games on the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you have to start brightly, like Brookline and like Medina.
If the momentum goes in one direction, it will put a great deal of pressure on the average competitions.
We set up our team accordingly and put the boys on the field in a way we feel that this will be a miracle tomorrow.
Thomas has been given the task of trying to run the competition and is the best match with Roy McIlroy, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the best Europeans in the competition.
“I put my boys in this order because I think we’re well covered,” Bjorn said in his selection of individual games.
Germany's new warship is failing again.
The German Navy’s latest high-speed missile should have been launched in 2014, replacing the outdated Cold War’s slow warships, but this will not happen before the next year due to faulty systems and snowball costs, the local media reported.
The deployment of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class high-speed craft Rheinland-Pfalzi has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 in accordance with the military press releases published in Die Zeit.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the alarming post-transmission problems did not make the fate of this ambitious project easy.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 replace the outdated Bremen class high-rises.
It is understood that they have a powerful cannon, a number of aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some concealing technologies such as radars, infrared and hearing signals.
Other important options include longer maintenance periods - the latest rapid eruptions should be able to be sent out of home delivery for up to two years.
However, long-term delays mean that top-notch warships - which allow Germany to strengthen power abroad - will become an aging for the time of entering the service.
The failed F125 expresser appeared last year when the German Navy officially refused to use the ship and returned it to the Hamburg Blohm & Voss shipyard.
This was the first time the Navy has sent the ship back to the ship builder after it was received.
The reasons for the return were very little known, but the German media cited a number of important “software and hardware deficiencies” that made the warship unusable if they were used in the combat mission.
The lack of software was particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg class ships are managed by a team of around 120 sailors - only half of the senior Bremen class high-speed workers.
It also showed that the ship is significantly overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the capacity of the Navy to add future innovations.
The 7,000-tonne weight “Rheinland-Pfalz” is probably twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project will also become a problem, including the training of the team.
It has been said that it will reach EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion) compared to EUR 2.2 billion originally.
The problems of the latest high speed loops are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German Navy’s capacity is shrinking.
At the beginning of the year, the chairman of the German Parliament's Defence Committee Hans-Peter Bartels acknowledged that the Navy had actually \"accessary ships\".
The official said that this issue has grown as a snowball over time, because old ships were removed, but no replacement ships came.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg classes could join the Navy.
National Trust explores the secret life of bats
The aim of a new study conducted in Scotland’s mountainous land is to reveal how bats use the landscape to look for their food.
It is hoped that the results will give new light to the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future protective measures.
The study of the Scottish National Trust researchers monitors the regular and sopranipelles in the Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross, as well as the brown long-earth and Daubenton bats.
Special recordings shall be placed in the main places of the area to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers also conduct field research using handheld sensors.
The competent assessment of all recordings shall determine the frequency and species of skin bindings.
Then a map of habitats and a report will be created to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
NTS Nature Protection Adviser Rob Dewar expects the results to show which habitats are the most important for bats and how different species use them.
This information will help to determine the usefulness of managing habitats, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the stock of bats has decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affects their habitat and its disappearance.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as flying papers and chemical processing of some construction materials, as well as attacks on pet cats.
The skin rays are not really dark.
But because of their night hunting, their ears are more useful when they catch the harvest than their eyes.
They use complex kaja location techniques to identify insects and obstacles on their aircraft.
The NTS, responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land, is very serious about bats.
They have ten trained experts who regularly conduct studies, reviews, and sometimes rescue.
The organization has even created the first and only special skin mice of Scotland in the area of Thraive in Dumfrie and Galloways, where eight of the 10 skin mice of Scotland live.
The real estate manager David Thompson says that this area is the ideal territory for them.
“We have a large area for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a great place to live.
But there is still a lot to discover about bats, so the work we do here and in other areas helps us to understand what they need to understand better.
He stresses the importance of controlling bats before starting maintenance activities in the real estate, as the unwanted destruction of a single place of pregnancy and childbirth can kill up to 400 mothers and adolescents, and even destroy the entire local population.
Leather mice are protected and their killing, disrupting or destroying is illegal.
The Scottish officer, Elisabeth Ferrell, has encouraged the public to contribute.
He said: “We still have so much to learn about our bats, and we just don’t know many of our species and how their populations feed.”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges, while lawyers plan to refer to the German magazine court.
Cristiano Ronaldo has rejected the rape charges against him as a “false”, saying that people “want to advertise themselves,” using his name.
His lawyers are going to court charges issued by the German newspaper Der Spiegel.
A Portuguese and Juventus attacker has been accused of rape by American woman Kathryn Mayorga in the Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He has allegedly paid the women's population $330 643,10 euros to not talk about the incident, said Der Spiegel on Friday.
Turning on Instagram's direct video after the charges of his 142 million trackers, Ronaldo (33) was reported to be \"false-mowers\".
“No, no, no, no, no.
There is a fake news today,\" said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner of the news.
They want to promote themselves by my name.
It's common.
They want to be famous with my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is fine, adding a player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing for a lawsuit in Der Spiegel’s court in connection with “an unacceptable suspicion of privacy.
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player is seeking compensation for “the rise of moral harm, which corresponds to the difficulty of the infringement, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in the Palms Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas, in June 2009.
After a night club meeting, Ronaldo and Mayor were allegedly returned to the hotel room where he allegedly was raped on the basis of documents presented in Nevada, according to Clark County District Court.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was “99% a good man, one of whom “one percent fails.”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed a couple of sexual relationships, but it wasn’t uniform.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and made photos of injuries in the hospital, but later agreed with an out-of-court solution, because he was afraid of \"the charge\" and was concerned about \"public humiliation\".
Now, a 34-year-old woman says she's trying to reschedule the solution, because the alleged case continues to traumatize her.
Ronaldo had left Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack and joined Real Madrid, and this summer he moved to the giant Juve with a transaction of 100 million euros to Italy.
Brexit: The U.K. can begin to regret the departure of car manufacturers forever
The United Kingdom \"for ever,\" when it lost its position as a world leader in the automotive industry after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that the Toyota U.K. had told BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without agreement, it would temporarily stop production at a factory near Derby in Burnaston.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of cross-border stops without the Brexit agreement could be paid for jobs.
The Burnaston factory, where vehicles are manufactured in Toyota Auris and Avens, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that when Britain starts leaving the EU at the end of March, we will see the production process stopping at its factory,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Burnastoni Toyota.
Other UK car manufacturers have also feared leaving the EU without agreement, concerned about the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says, for example, closes the Mini factory in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the risks of the supply chain in the absence of the Brexit agreement.
The Toyota production line works according to the need for spare parts to arrive from the United Kingdom and from the EU every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances at the border which, according to industry, may lead to delays and lack of parts.
Toyota would not be able to keep more than one day stock in its Derbyshire factory, so production needs to be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May Chequers’ plan for future EU relations has been “recalibrated accurately to avoid such checks at the border.”
“We need an agreement. We want the best solution to enable what we want and not just use the current success, but the whole opportunity,” he said to BBC Radio 4 on Today.
“The facts about Toyota not only, but also about other producers show that we need to be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production will be stopped, but in the long run, he warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and would eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvalari, a representative of the Unite trade union, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In our own experience, we know that when the jobs disappear, they will not return.
The government spokesman said: “We have put forward an accurate and reliable plan of our future relations with the EU.
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says the White House
The meeting with Donald Trump's major contributions to Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein may be postponed for another week, as the fight against the highest-level candidate Brett Kavanaugh will continue, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein will monitor the work of Special Commissioner Robert Mueller, who will investigate the intervention of the Russian elections, the links between Trump’s assistants and Russia, and the prevention of possible justice on the part of the President.
Whether Trump triggers the Deputy Prosecutor General and thus threatens Mueller’s independence, Washington’s rumors have been leaked for several months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times announced that Rosenstein discussed the use of interrogation tools to record conversations with Trump and the possibility to remove the President through Amendment 25.
Rosenstein didn't confirm it.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, stating he was going back.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced Thursday, who was then reported to the United Nations in New York at that time.
Trump said he didn't want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a coincidence with a hearing of the Senate jury, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, gave them both hours.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the Senate vote.
Trump Pressman Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday in Fox News.
When he was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein: “This date is not yet set, it may be this week, but it may be postponed another week, taking into account all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But let's look at it and keep the press informed, as always.
Some journalists would argue: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The manager, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of information was not due to the disappointment of TV journalists, although he added: “I don’t argue with the fact that they were disappointed.
He then recommended direct contact between Trump and the press.
The president makes more questions and answers to the session than any president before him,\" he said, without adding any evidence: “We have looked at these numbers.”
The information lessons continue, Sanders confirmed, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States questions directly, it’s much better than talking to me.
We try to do so a lot and you've seen how we've done it in the last couple of weeks, so it's going to take place during the press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with guests.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president, perhaps, showed why, prior to the release of the journalists, and sometimes with a strange look.
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff in NHS Scotland regarding Brexit's fears
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in the NHS of Scotland to express the country’s thanks and wishes for their post-Brexit stay.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent his letter if the UK left the EU for less than six months.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the costs of the established status of EU citizens working in its public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “In the summer, negotiations have continued on the return between the UK and the EU, headed towards the expected decisions of the autumn.
However, the UK government has also prepared for a possible non-contractual scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for you.
That is why I wanted to repeat how much I appreciate every employee's contribution, regardless of his nationality.
Professionals from all over the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care and benefit our service patients and communities.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie
Tennessee State Tigers support player Christion Abercrombie passed an extraordinary cut after Saturday's major injury and defeat 31 : 27 Vanderbilt Commodores, published by Tennessee Mike Organ.
The chief coach of Tennessee State Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the half-time.
“He fell on the village and just collapsed,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical professionals gave Abercrombie a oxygen in the village before she was placed on the canderam for further inspection from the field.
The Tennessee State official told Chris Harrison (WSMV - Nashville, Tennessee) that the operation of Abercrombie at Vanderbilt Medical Center had ended.
Harris added that there are no details about the type of injury, and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second year student with a red shirt, was in Tennessee State during his first season after the arrival of Illinois.
He had five battles on Saturday before leaving the game, which made 18 matches this season.
Foreign buyers must pay a higher stamp tax when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers must pay a higher stamp tax if they buy real estate in the UK using this extra money to assist homeless people on the basis of new Tory plans
This step will destroy Corbyn’s effort to attract young voters
A temple tax is charged to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects it to create up to 120 million pounds per year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers must pay a higher rate of stamp duty when they buy real estate in the UK using this extra money to assist homeless people, Theresa May announced today.
The movement is considered to be an attempt to unfavorable Jeremy Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters with promises to provide them with affordable housing and to target high-income people.
Individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK will be taxed with a temple tax, directing additional money to the government’s desire to fight homelessness.
The additional fee - which is in addition to this stamp tax, including higher levels, which were introduced two years ago for purchases related to the second home and the reorganization may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that this movement will create up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13% of the properties purchased in London belong to non-UK residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to get under their feet when buying a home.
Many of the prosperous regions of the country, especially in the capital city, have become “intention cities” thanks to a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy will only arrive a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the temple tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices if they buy land but do not use it, and asked Mayd to give up on affordable home quotas in order to improve the shame associated with the UK “life”
Corbyn has announced a review of the reform of the residential economy, including rent control and the abolition of exploitation of innocent people.
He also wants to give councils greater powers in building new homes.
May said: “In the previous year, I promised to commit myself as prime minister to the restoration of the British dream – that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means improving our broken housing market.
Britain is always open to people who want to live, work and build their own lives here.
At the same time, it is not right for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies abroad, to buy homes as hard-working residents of the British people.
For too many people, the dream of having a home has become too far away, and harsh sleeping conditions are a normal reality.
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to manage Scotland.
Sunderlan’s leader, Jack Ross, says that his “final goal” is to become the leader of Scotland at some point.
Scotland (42) welcomes the challenge of revitalizing the North-Estonian club, who is currently in the third place in League One, with only 3 points behind.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after he had taken St Mirren back to the Scottish Champions League last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I reached class B and was limited to it,\" Ross BBC told Scotland's Sports Sound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father, and it’s always something that has drawn me back.
This option will only come when I’m successful in running the club.
Ross's predecessors were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says that he did not feel fear of such great and well-known names, having previously resisted both Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success is now when I can bring this club to the Champions League.”
Due to its structure and facilities, this club definitely belongs to the Champions League,\" he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I see myself as successful only if I can get the club back there.”
Ross has worked as a leader for only three years, prior to being the Deputy Director of Dumbarton and 15 months among the leading staff at Hearts.
He then helped Alloo recover from falling to the third level and turned St Mirren's lowest position into the winner of the next championship.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he was at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was a real crossroad,” he recalls Alloa’s takeover.
“I really thought that leadership was better for me than playing.
It seems weird because I made it, got a reasonable income, and enjoyed some top moments.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things to do every week.
I’m still experiencing it with my work’s tension and pressure in mind, but the management just seems more correct.
I've always wanted to lead and now I'm doing it, and I feel more comfortable now than ever before in adulthood.

Summer heat has improved the flow of pubs in British trouble, but greater pressure has been exerted on restaurants chains.
The figures showed that pubs and bars went up by 2.7% in July, but restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, the CGA’s representative of the business consulting company, said: “A longer participation in the world championships than expected of sunshine and England meant that July was similar to June, when pubs’ turnover grew by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants became even more difficult.
In June, the trade in restaurants decreased by 1.8% in July.
The drinks-based pubs and bars were the most successful and the restaurants are the worst.
Food-based pubs also suffered despite the sun, although not as dramatic as restaurants.
People just wanted to go out for a drink.
The sale of beverages between managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6% during the month, while the sale of food fell by three percent.
Paul Newman, an analyst for leisure and hospitality, said: “These results will continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The effects of the weather and major social or sporting events remain the largest factor in sales outside the home market.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to fight, although the decrease in sales is 4.8% compared to the previous year, especially painful in addition to the current price pressure.
Long and hot summer would not have been able to come at a worse time for food businesses, and only time will show whether the moderater temperatures we have experienced in August provide some indispensable relief.

One of the five children has secret social media accounts they hide for their parents
The study has resulted in one of the five children, some of them 11 years old, have secret social media accounts hidden from their parents and teachers.
A study conducted among 20,000 gymnasts found the “false insta” growth of pages
The news raised the fear of posting sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they had a “base account” designed to show their parents
The study resulted in one child from five, some of them only 11 years old, creating secret social media accounts that they hide for adults.
A study conducted among 20,000 gymnasts found a significant increase in “false Instagram” accounts.
The news increased the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students said they had a “base account” designed to show parents and accept them.
One of his 13-year-old daughter’s secret pages discovered that a teenager called on others to rape.
The Digital Awareness UK and Private School Association Headmasters – and Headmistresses – Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles and half of them recognized the existence of personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chief of HMC, said: “It’s disturbing to see so many teens being tempted to create accounts online, where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilith Doyle will be a spokesperson at the Scottish Athletics Board
Elith Doyle was elected CEO of the Management Board of Scottish Athletics at the annual meeting.
Doyle is the most laudable lightweight athlete in Scotland and Chairman Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from his extensive international experience in the last decade.

Doyle said: “I wish to be a spokesperson of athletes and I hope that I can make a real contribution to Scotland’s sport and contribute to its development.”
The American, who won the 1996 Atlanta Olympics in 200 metres and 400 metres in total four Olympic goldes, and now often shares his opinion in the BBC, could not walk after a transit ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that I would recover and if, to what extent, only time would show.
I've done a hard job, but I've completely restored, I've learned to walk again, and I'm already doing speed training!
Thank you for encouraging messages.
Breast Pump Advertising, which compares women to cows, divides the Internet into two
The breast pump company has shared the internet with two camp ads comparing the nursing mother with milking cows.
To celebrate the presentation, the first silent breast pump in the world, the technology company Elvie published a similar ad for consumers in order to present the freedom that this new pump gives itself to willing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a table filled with hay with cows and sing, \"Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see me tails, and if you didn't notice, they're not oxals, they're my breasts.
Repeats of the verse: “Pumpa, pump, feed children, pump, pump, fill with milk with my own ladies.”
However, the advertising published on the Facebook page of the company has led to similar opinions on the Internet.
The viewers of a video with 77,000 reviews and thousands of comments have a different opinion, many of them say it illuminates the tents of the dairy industry.
“The use of cows to promote this product was a very poor decision.
As we do, they need to get pregnant and give birth to milk, but the difference is that they will be stolen from them in the days of their birth.
Elvie breast pump does not stick to the breast-feeding eye (Elvie/Mother)
Another commentator said: “It is likely traumatizing for both mother and child.
But why not use these children to promote the breast pump of the mothers who are still receiving them?
Someone added: Absolutely unscrupulous advertising.
Part of it is by advertising, and one woman thought the story was very fun.
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd buy myself something like that if I were still feeding my breasts.
The pumping of the milk made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but let's take it the way it is.
It’s a brilliant product,” wrote one.
Another comment said: “It’s a fun advertisement for mothers who’re pumping their jobs or toilets and who feel like cows.
This advertising does not praise or condemn the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the group reveals women that they have all danced in bras with not eye-catching pumps.
The idea of a campaign is based on the fact that many women pump milk feel like a cow.
However, Elvie Pump is completely quiet, there are no wires or pipes, and does not look like a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep children and even walk outside during pumping.
Mother’s partner and ECD Ana Balarin commented: “Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserved a bold and annoying introduction.
With the comparison of women's expression and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the pumping of the breast and all its challenges, while at the same time presenting the exhilarating and familiar key to the extraordinary appeal of freedom, which the new pump creates.
It's not the first time the news has covered Elvie's pump.
In London’s fashion week, the mother of two children wearing Marta Jakubowski’s product appeared.
Thousands of migrants’ children quietly went to the Texas border on the tellagris.
The number of children arrested by migrants has suddenly risen, although monthly border crossings have remained quite the same. Partly because the Trump administrator enforces tough rhetoric and policy has made it difficult to establish children with sponsors.
Usually, most sponsors with documents are immigrants and they are afraid to violate the possibility of staying in their country, requiring the child’s custody.
The threat increased in June when the national authorities announced that possible sponsors and other adults belonging to the household could present fingerprints and data are shared with the immigration authorities.
The senior immigration and customs officer Matthew Albence admitted to Congress last week that the agency arrested a dozen people who applied for financial support for the accompanying minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were missing a criminal record.
About 80 percent of sponsors or sponsors’ family members are illegally present in the country and a large number of them are in criminal background.
So we're going to keep following them,\" Mr. Albence said.
In order to deal with children faster, officials enforced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of the arrest.
Many defend their legal content in front of the immigration judge through a video conference, to come in.
In order to be released, the unfit will be promptly expelled from the country.
According to the asylum workers, and on the basis of reports published in recent months, the longer the child is under arrest, the more likely they will become nervous or depressed, which may cause violent protests or attempts to escape.
According to the lawyers, these concerns are more current in large prison facilities such as Tornillo, where the child’s difficulties can remain between two eyes due to the size of the child.
They added that moving children to a tent town without leaving enough time to get used to or say goodbye to friends, can cause trauma that many are already in trouble.
Syria calls for the immediate departure of US, French and Turkish occupation forces
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem invited Syrian refugees to come home at the UN General Assembly, even though the country has been in war for the eighth year.
MOULEM, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces on Syria were an illegal anti-terrorist pretext and are dealt with accordingly.
“They must leave immediately and unconditionally,” he said in the Assembly.
More than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have left their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to “fight in this holy war until we have cleaned the entire area of Syria – from both terrorist groups and from any illegally present foreign power.”
The United States has around 2,000 forces in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish units and Syrian Arabs, who are opponents of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops from the war.
Speaking about the war refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were appropriate and he accused the unconscious fears that prevented refugees from coming, spreading some of the Western countries.
“We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help their faces,” he said.
“They’re making a policy of something that’s just a humanitarian problem.”
The United States of America and the European Union have warned that there is no agreement between Syria and Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which creates the last rebel support point in Idlib's buffer zone, has created an opportunity to progress with political talks.
The Russian-Turkey agreement prevented the widespread capture of the Syrian forces in the province of three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem stressed that the treaty had “clear deadlines” and expressed the hope that military action would be hit by the fighters of the jihadists, including the Nustra Front, involved in Al-Qaeda.
The UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura will soon convince the Committees of the new members of government and opposition to plan the post-war Syria constitution and pave the way for the election.
Moualem called for the Syrian Government to participate in the Committee, saying that the panel could be limited to examining the articles of the present Constitution and warned against intervention.
Why Trump is elected for another term
According to this logic, Trump could be won in the next elections in 2020, if the removal of the office and scandal had not previously completed his presidential office, as it is likely that liberal viewers would like to do.
What should undoubtedly be the most exciting end of the Presidential Board?
Currently viewers do not show signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, peak hour ratings have doubled in CNN to over 1.05 million and in MSNBC to almost triple 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the peak hour. Compared to four years ago, the number of viewers has risen. MSNBC is receiving the “The Rachel Maddow Show” 3.5 million cable viewers have kept this rating high during the main evening news.
“It’s the tension we’re involved in because we don’t understand it,” said ABC’s drama “Designed Survivor,” a leader of the government secretary, who becomes president when the attack destroys the Parliamentary House.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of the book \"Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, is another theory.
He remembers the 2016 pre-election taxi ride in Boston.
The manager told him he was voting for Mr. Trump.
“Why” he asked.
\"He said he makes me laugh,\" Ms. Scovell told me.
All this chaos has an entertaining value.
Of course, not like other television shows, Washington rumors can be fatal to Roe v. Wade's future and reunite the willing immigrant families and the global economy.
Avoiding the topic is only a priority for viewers.
However, a six-hour talk about Bob Woodward’s “based background research,” for his book “Fear” and Paul Manafort’s 13 225,73€-paying jaanalinunahat Bomber’s jacket (Washington Post said about this “excessive self-confidence in clothing” and Stormy Daniels’s backgrounds in relation to the description of Mr Trump’s anatomy’s orientated description, the viewer is more than an educated citizen.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario again with the same feeling.
“One of his activities, which may seem to be a true-life series, is that he shares something every night,” said the CEO and CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment, “Pandits – the creator of Brent Montgomery Trump’s show, with the moments of the day-to-day show (and-day plan for NFL, Kim Jong-uni praise).

This week, at Fleiss, his home was 80 degrees warm on the northern shore of Kauai, but he had fallen into the room to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not give up looking at how Brett Kavanaugh was to be executed in the Senate's Legal Committee and how the fate of the Supreme Court hangs on the hair.
“I remember how we did all sorts of crazy shows in our time and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Other cash flows to the coolest White House
It is not surprising that the 17th division of Pennsylvania receives a cash flow due to the restructuring of the Convention area, receiving two dominant undertakings at the same place.
As a result, the district of Pittsburgh was re-elected from the Democratic Republic of Conor Lamb, who won the place in the second district during the extraordinary elections last spring.
Lamb's opponent is the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the former Pennsylvania 12th Division, which in the larger division overlaps with the new 17.
The maps were changed after the decision of the High Court of Pennsylvania in January, and the old districts were divided into anti-constitutional electoral areas, favouring the Republicans.
The new 17th elections have saved the municipality a campaign in which the financial departments of the largest political parties, the Congress Committee for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the National Committee for the Republican Campaign (NRCC).
Lamb became well known in Pennsylvania after the defeat of a lot of the extraordinary elections of the 18th Congress District of Pennsylvania in March.
This is what a Republican has been doing for several decades, and President Donald Trump has won 20 points in the district.
Politicians have given Democrats a small advantage.
U.S. El Salvador was punished for supporting China, then withdrawn.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognised Beijing, which was a small setback to Washington.
Mr. Trump met with President Juan Carlos Varela in a friendly atmosphere in June 2017 and owned the Panama hotel until the partners threw Trump's management team out.
The officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to recall the US leaders of the diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, since the ministry spokesperson Heather Nauert said earlier this month that these countries had not recently supported Taiwan.
However, only El Salvador was planned to be punished, which received $140 million in 2017 from the United States, including the monitoring, development and economic boost of drugs.
The proposed sanctions, which included the reduction of financial assistance and visa restrictions, would have been painful to the Central American State and its high unemployment and the number of killings.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level meeting aimed at security and economic prosperity to organise a leave to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a development in efforts to prevent displaced persons from moving to the United States.
But in mid September, high officials explained that they wanted to continue to meet and stop discussing any El Salvador sanctions.
According to the diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pence will now be evaluated, who will speak at the mid-October meeting to discuss the positions of the government.
And three US ambassadors returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new harsh reports or penalties from Washington.
The White House spokesperson, Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details discussed by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss national debates at the request of anonymity.
Their discussions were confirmed by a close analyst who also spoke to the government at the request of anonymity.
History of History
Next, the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller will publish a report on Trump’s possible justice, for which there is a lot of evidence in the state archives.
Mueller also reportedly investigates whether Trump’s campaign relates to the Russian attack on our elections.
If Congress had to change the party, Trump must understand in this institution as if he were going to speak to the voters and perhaps even his peers.
There are a lot of denies here, and I do not want to point out that the withdrawal of Trump or his European counterparts is inevitable.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which affects the duration of the fight.
In 1938, the German officials were ready to turn against Hitler if only in the West had prevented him and supported the Czechoslovakian Münich.
We missed and missed the chance to avoid the following multi-annual killings.
History goes around such an unloved march of turning points and democracy, or it goes on to delay.
The Americans are now facing a number of turning points.
What do we do when Trump fires the prosecutor's deputy director Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the spring water since he was announced that he had made a motion to keep the president secret last year and speculated about the incompatibility of that position.
Rosenstein says The Times's statement is inaccurate.
“How to respond if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite reliable accusations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And, above all, do we vote for Congress in central elections if Trump is to be held responsible?
If these tests fail, democracy will take a long winter vacation.
But I don't think we've failed because we've learned from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported by the same Nazi regime in Auschwitz, who once took over and used our ambassador's home.
He survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, he sent me the light of the candles on the table with a hammer.
How should I not be optimistic about our future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimized before the Battle of Rapid Vienna
Rangers organizes Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over Australia, which was followed by an impressive Viking against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, will place them in a strong position to become a European League of League G-group.
The knee injury did not allow the middle player Graham Dorrans from the first appearance of the season before 2 : 2 with the ending of the game against the Villarreal, but believes that Rangers can use this result as a jump table for better results.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a strong opponent,” the 31-year-old player said.
“We went to the game, believing that we could achieve something and we left the game with a point.
Perhaps we could have achieved more, but in general it was a fair result.
They were better in the first half of the game and again in the second half.
Thursday will be another big and important European night.
Hopefully we get three points, but it will be a difficult game, because they got a good result in their last game, but since the people support us, I am sure we can get together and get a good result.
Last year was difficult, thanks to the fact that I was injured and there were changes inside the club, but now we all feel good inside.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, leave the previous season behind and be successful.
Women cannot sleep because of fear of pension insurance
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed it with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said he talked to his children about it.
“People want family members to take care of them, but at the same time they don’t talk about it,” explained Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationalwide’s Life Insurance.
This should start.
Talk to your husband and children: You cannot prepare for the care of your family if they do not know your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and family by discussing where and how to get care, as these choices can be extremely important in relation to costs.
Consult your financial advisor: Your advisor may have a good plan to pay for these expenses.
Your funding opportunities for long-term care may include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance policies, hybrid financial life insurance policies to help cover these costs, or early self-insurance - as long as you have the necessary money.
Prepare your legal documents: Stop all possible legal battles already in place.
Ask yourself about a health certificate to determine a trusted person who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals follow your wishes if you are unable to communicate with yourself.
Consider also the trust in your financial support.
Choose a reliable person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid even if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the little details: Imagine that your old mother has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down these things so you can be ready if necessary.
“It’s not just a financial side, but it’s also important for those who would be doctors,” Martin explained.
What medicines are needed?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Put it all in place.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a huge earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Indonesia on Friday, officials reported that the number of deaths is still increasing.
Since the connection has been interrupted, the rescuers have not received any information from the Donggala Regent in the north of Palu, which remains close to the epicentre of the 7.5-magnituary earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.

The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists in the cage.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for domestic violence charges
The oldest son of Track Palin, former Governor of Alaska and Vice President, Sarah Palin, has been arrested in connection with the attack.

According to a police report, when a female person tried to inform the police of alleged crimes, Palin took his phone.
The prize will be held at the Mat-Su Pre-Flight Research Agency and will be held against a 500-dollar bailout, the KTUU reported.
He appeared in a court on Saturday where he declared that he was “not guilty in any case,” reported the news network.

He has also been accused of a B-class misdemeanour, punishable by one-day imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, his father Todd Palin was accused of attacking him.
In connection with the alleged attack, the police ordered his mother Sarah Palin.
The case is currently being discussed in Alaska's Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of an attack at home, an act of domestic violence in intervention and possession of a weapon, all in a drunk state.
His girlfriend said he hit him in the face.
Veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 when he joined his son's violent behavior with PTSD, which was due to his service in Iraq.

In NYC, federal prosecutors apply for a rare death penalty for suspects in a terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York apply for a death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected in a New York City terrorist attack in which eight people were killed. This rare punishment has not been executed for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov (30) allegedly used the Home Depot rental car to attack the bikes along the West Side highways on Lower Manhattan in October, both pedestrians and cyclists.
According to the report of the death penalty in the southern region of New York, prosecutors have to prove that Saipov deliberately killed eight victims and caused serious body injuries intentionally.
In both cases, it is a possible death penalty on the basis of judicial documents.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal conspirators presented a 22-point charge to the entire Saipov, including eight homicides with blackmail, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized criminal crimes, and a charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack was supposed to be “intentionary planning and forecasting,” the prosecutors said, describing Saipov’s actions as “suspecting, cruel, and dirty.”
“Sayfullo Habibulavic Saipov caused injuries, damage and damage to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco’s family and friends,” he said.
Five victims were tourists in Argentina.
There have been ten years since the last case of death of the District Court in the south of New York.
The accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but the final result was that he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in 1953 in Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a federal case in New York, where the couple were executed in a conspiracy to carry out a spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an indigenous worm, showed the lack of regret in the days following the attack and months, according to the court documents.
According to the police, he had told the investigators that he was happy with the work.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack to commit the videos of ISIS from his phone.
According to police, he also wanted an ISIS flag in his hospital palace.
In 22-point charges, he has not committed any guilt.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s national defenders, said that they were “seriously disappointed in the judgment of the proceedings.”
“We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty will prolong the trauma of all those involved, rather than lifelong imprisonment, which would be taken without the possibility of being released,” Patton said.
Previously, Saipov's defense team asked prosecutors not to apply for a death penalty.
Mr Tory said that NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised today that the Tory Conference would protest \"mobilize the People's Army\"
The former UKIP leader said that politicians had to know the “hot” of Eurosceptics, because one of the members of Theresa May’s own parliament recommended that they lead negotiations with the EU.
Mr. Peter Bone, a conservative sub-house member, said on the march in Birmingham, that the UK was already out, if Mr. Farage was Secretary of Brexit.
However, Mrs. May is facing the problem of the reconciliation of his deeply divided lines, highlighted by the conservatives in favour of staying, joining the city with their anti-Brexit protest.
The Prime Minister is in trouble with keeping his Chequers plan on track in the middle of Brexit supporters, remnants and EU attacks.
The Allies demanded that they continue to deal with Brussels despite a counterattack and forced the Eurosceptics and liberals to choose between their package and the “cash”.
Bone said, when Leave Means Leave gathered in Solihull, that he wanted to give up \"Chequers' plan\".
He recommended to take Farage as a partner and to give him responsibility in negotiations with Brussels.
\"We'd be out of charge by now,\" he said.
Wellingborough said: “I stand out for Brexit, but we must give up Chequers’ plan.”
In reflecting his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in the world wars to be subordinate.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Bone rejected the recommendations that since the 2016 vote, the public opinion has now changed: “I believe that British people have changed their minds and want to remain, is not true.”
Tory Brexit’s supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march and told reporters: “I’m saying one thing: Prime Minister, listen to people.
“Chequers’ plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our party and among our activists who actually walk along the streets and choose us at all.
Please leave Chequers' plan and start listening.
With a message directed at Mayle, he added: “The ministers can keep their jobs as they stick to their promises.”
Farage said that the politicians who had been gathered must be “feeling of heat” when they plan to betray the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
“This is now the question of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
\"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that \"we won't let it happen.\"
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to put our political class, which is at the edge of Brexit’s betrayal, uncomfortable to feel.
“We mobilize the public army of the country that gave us a victory with Brexit, and we will not rest until we have achieved an independent, self-government, proud UK.
At the same time, the remnants marched through Birmingham before the two-hour gathering at the heart of the city.
The “Toors Against Brexit” was a huge blow for the group after the group was set up this weekend.
In the Liberal Lord Adoni, the Conservatives mocked the security issues that became part of their party’s application when the conference was opened.
“These are the people who say that IT systems can be established and all technology can lead Canada and more to smooth cross-border trade in Ireland without cross-border restrictions,” he added.
“It’s a full fart.
There is no such thing as good Brexit, he added.

Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will be nominated for the next election in November by the GOP National Representative for Geoff Diehl, who was Vice President of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It is said that he can be opposed to Trump in 2020.
The afternoon event at Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in the Town Hall after Trump's appointment.
He asked if he was going to run for president.
Warren said, “It’s time for women to go to Washington and improve our broken government, that’s why it’s also a highlight.”
The LSU Sims shooting was arrested.
LA Police at Baton Rouge reported on Saturday that the suspect of the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims was arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 o'clock in the morning at the ET News Conference.
They released a video of Friday shooting, asking for help to identify a visible man on the graphs.
A 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed at Southern University near the city of Friday early in the morning.
\"Wayde Sims got a bullet wound in his head and died behind it,\" police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, 247sport.
Wayde came to protect his friend and got a bullet from Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on the scene, possession of a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested in East Baton Rouge police station.
Almost two-metre young man Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, 10 of them in the original composition, an average of 17.4 minutes, throwing 5.6 points and taking 2.9 tableballs per game.
Russia Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after the team's record gave him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
From this moment on it became clear that Valtteri Bottas qualified Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the order of the Mercedes team played a major role in the race.
Bottas started well and left Hamilton almost in trouble when he was protecting his position on the first two occasions and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to go to the box stations and left the Hamilton group behind in a tight traffic that should have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the box later, and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton went to lead after the state, when Ferrari's leader left an intruder to pass the inner side open after the third corner of the attempt to protect it with double immersion.
Max Verstappen started the competition on the back of the grid and was at the end of the first round in his 21-year-old birthday.
He then led the race for most of the time, driving towards the finish of the rubbers and passing from Kimi Räikkönen, taking the fourth place.
He finally went to the box stop on the 44th round, but he failed to increase the speed of the last eight rounds, which gave Räikkönen a fourth place.
Today is a difficult day, because Valtteri has been doing a good job all week and was a real gentleman with me.
“The crew has done a great job to have one of the two,” Hamilton said.
It was a very poor body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein on Saturday due to the incident that she had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter indicting the Supreme Court's nod Brett Kavanaugh in sexual harassment.
Speaking of Western Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony given by Ford to the Senate’s Legal Affairs Committee, but instead commented on what was happening in the Senate at the moment, which shows that people are “serious, disgusting and false”
“The only beautiful thing that is happening in the Senate in a couple of days is that you see angry and angry, wicked, disgusting and false people,” he said.
“When you look at the press releases and leaks that you say, “Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it.
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember his answer to the question, “Did you leak the document?”
Oh, no.
I didn't leak \"
Wait a minute.
Whether we leaked... no, we didn't leak, he added with the look of the Senator.
Ford sent a letter to Feinstein in July on charges against Kavanaugh and it was leaked at the beginning of September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his job.
The Hill said: “I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations or leaked his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“He asked me to keep my confidentiality and, according to his request, I did so too.”
However, his denial was not suitable for the president, who said: “You know what, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but it's one of the worst body languages I've ever seen.
By continuing to defend the candidate of the Supreme Court who has been accused of sexual abuse of three women, the president suggested that the Democrats would use these charges for their own purposes.
“They have decided to take back the power without selecting the funds.
You will see this folly and disgustingness. They don't care who they hurt, who they need to take over to get power and control,\" said the president of the Media.
Elitliga: Dundee Stars 5 : 3 Belfast Giants
Giantsi Patrick Dwyer scored two gates against Dundee
Dundee Stars won the Friday elite at the Belfast Giants meeting, who lost Dundee 5 :3.
Giants started the game early with two gates to lead Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier from the gate.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took home the jungle before Dwyer led Giants again.
Francois Bouchard compared Dundee's position before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's gates secured their victory.
It was the third loss of the elite league for Adam Keefe's men. They came to Belfast on Friday night to win Dundeed at 2:1.
This was the fourth meeting of the half season, of which Giants won the last three games.
Dwyer's opening gate came in 4 minutes with Kendall McFaul and David Rutherford's help, when Beauvillier dubbed the successes four minutes later.
Sullivan brought home the team quickly in the first trimester of 13:10 back to the game before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie hit the jungle gate in 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer ensured that Giants would lead before the first break, at the end of the first third of his night at the second gate.
At home, the players regrouped and Bouchard put them back on the level, luring a number of overweight at 27:37 Gates.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee a first-time lead in the game at the end of the second-third, securing the last-third victory in his team's attack zone.
Giants who have now lost four of the last five games will meet Milton Keynes at home in the next game.
The pilot dies to save hundreds of people from the earthquake.
One Indonesian pilot was declared a hero after he gave his life to ensure a safe aircraft of hundreds of people.
The great earthquake that struck the island of Sulawes on Friday caused tsunamis, after which more than 800 people were killed, many of whom were not known to disappear.
The region is surrounded by strong post-warms, and many people in the city of Palu are trapped under the ruins of the ruins.
Despite the fact that 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung’s colleagues fled from Palu Mutira Sis Al Jufri airport’s fluctuating airport, he refused to leave.
He remained on the post to ensure the safe take-off of Batik Air at the same time.
Then he jumped out of the tower, thinking it would collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia’s spokesman Yohannes Sirait confirmed that his decision to save hundreds of lives could be saved, Australian ABC News said.
We put a helicopter ready to transport Kalimantan from Balikpapan to another city's major hospital.
Unfortunately, he died in the morning, before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We were extremely sad when we heard of it,” the press spokesman added.
At the same time, the authorities are afraid that the number of deaths could rise to thousands. According to the State disaster relief agency, access to the city of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was restricted.
Agent Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said: “The number of deaths can grow, because the bodies of many victims are still under the ruins and have not yet been found.”
The 6-metre waves destroyed the city of Palu, where mass loss takes place on Sunday.
Military and passenger aircraft provide assistance and equipment.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, said to Sky News: “The camp will bring new victims every minute.
Clean water is rare.
Everywhere there is a small market.
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “Indonesia’s Red Cross rushes to help the survivors, but we can’t tell what they can find there.
This is a tragedy, but the situation can get even worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the State Army: “I ask you to work nights and days to perform all the tasks related to evacuation.
Whether you're ready for this, CNN said.
In the beginning of this year, the Indonesian city of Lomboki was hit by an earthquake where more than 550 people were killed.
Micronesia’s plane crash: Air Niugin’s airline says there’s one man missing after the lagoon’s plane crash
Although it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from a floating plane, the airline, who led a plane that fell in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, claims that one man is missing.
Air Niugini said in his statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not find one male passenger.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find a man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the details of the passenger, such as questions concerning his or her age and nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane crashed in the water at the airport of Chuuk Island.
The officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, but their condition was stable.
The circumstances of the accident and the exact chain of events are still unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed far from the lagoon route.
Some witnesses thought the plane was crossing the plane.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane landed very low.
“It’s very good,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers were able to chain on a drowning plane in the water to an emergency exit.
He mentioned that the cabin crew was panicked and screamed, and that he had a little headache.
The U.S. Marines and sailors who worked on a nearby quake also helped rescue, using a flooding boat to bring people to the shore before the plane sank down about 30 meters.
The data from the aviation safety network show that 111 people have died in air accidents involving air carriers registered with PNG in the last two decades, but none of them were related to Air Niugin.
Analyst prepares a schedule for the evening when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor stopped the case of a man who was accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, spent several hours analyzing intelligence data as an expert observer.
He brought to the jury the way he used mobile phone calls to re-create the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellise and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers' movements on the night she died.
According to the newspaper The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he received location information from several mobile phones, which showed that Tellis was with Chambers that night when she died, which was in conflict with the previous claims of the young man.
When the data showed that he had been with Chambers, the young man himself claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford, so he went to talk to the police in Sanford.
Sanford entered the court on Saturday and admitted that he was not in town that day.
When the accusers asked him if Telles were telling the truth when he said he had been in Sanford's car, Sanford said that Tellis was saying, because my car was in Nashville.
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he had known Chambers before the girl died for about two weeks.
The phone records showed that the Nazis had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
“He erased her life,” Hale said.
It is scheduled to make a court call on Sunday.
The judge said he thought the case was going to be discussed in half a day's later for the jury.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
Hiphop trio wants to fight negative genre definition by adding positive messages to music.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has been removed from the beginnings of its political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to the roots of the hippo and make the conscious hippo again popular.
Bands such as The Fugees and Common have been re-gathering popularity in Britain thanks to bands such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
The New York babysitter complains about racist messages after a couple of courts
New York’s babysitter appeals to the court for discriminatory dismissal after a couple of accidentally received messages, where the mother complained that the babysitter was “a regular black –
The couple deny that they are racists, compared to the extermination of the situation.
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed her anger when she found out that their new lascrow service provider Giselle Maurice was black when she came to work for the first day in 2016.
Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote a message to his wife, saying: “EIIIIIIIIIIII, JÄRJEKORDNE MUSTANAHALI
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
According to the New York Post, the uncomfortable Plasco-Flaxman, after his professional understanding of Miss Maurice, claimed that their social babysitter, who was African American, had done a bad job and had been waiting for a Filipino instead.
Miss Maurice was paid for one working day and then sent home with Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing a couple of courts to get compensation for divorce, which she wants to receive daily 350 dollars in the amount of the next six months, and the same job she was initially hired to do, but without a contract.
\"I want to show them this way, so to do it,\" he said to the newspaper The Post, adding, \"I know it's discrimination.
A few have rejected the claim that they were racists, saying that the ending of employment with Maurice was a reasonable act, because they were afraid that they could no longer trust her after she was offended.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t think.
He's not racist.
“We are not racists,” said Joel Plasco’s wife in The Post.
“But did you allow your children to hold on to someone you have been rude to, even if it was unintentional?
Your newborn?
Come on, come on, come on.
Commenting on the comparison with blackmail, Plasco said that his wife was two months away from the birth of the child and was “very in a difficult situation”
Would you go against someone like that?
This is not very nice now,\" added the investment banker.
Although the case is still in progress, the public opinion has quickly condemned a couple of social medias, where they are severely evaluated due to their behavior and thinking.
The new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that readers did not communicate with a talking bear.
The daughter of Bond Karen Jankel, who was born immediately after the adoption of the book, said: “It is difficult to put herself in the shoes of a person who read it for the first time before the publication.
It is very fun to know what we know about the great success of Paddington.
He said that his father, when he was inspired to write a children's book about a small toy, worked as a BBC cameraman, would have been optimistic about his job being rejected, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book was the 60th anniversary of his father's death with a nucleus shadow last year.
As regards Paddington, who he described as a “very important member of our family,” he added that his father was silently proud of his final success.
“He was quite a quiet man and was not a proud man,” he said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was as if your child was achieving something: you are proud of them, even though it is not your achievement directly.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in this way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always recognized Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone.
When he was grounded, his daughter was rushed to Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors worked inappropriately to save her life.
“They regularly called to say that the condition of her daughter was very bad and that they did not believe she would survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
“Then I got a call from Nadi, who said that my daughter would die in two minutes, and I have to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tash, dear, I love you so much.
I'll see you soon.
I'll be with you soon.
The medications that the doctors gave him to push his heart forward had begun to disappear quietly and to leave his body.
He had died a little while before, and now all the systems began to stop working.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing what was going to happen.
I couldn’t cry, scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep myself together.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who now mourned his daughter, went to the plane with other passengers who didn’t know anything about his experiences.
\"No one knew that,\" he said.
“I kept my head down and tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a terrible loss of compassion for Nadi on this flight.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her.
Possession cards for a woman in mourning prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost their beloved suicide rabbit work together to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have pasted maps on the Wales Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he suffered depression, and 18 years old when he killed himself.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
45-year-old Ms. Davis, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile makes the room shine.
Nevertheless, he stopped working before he died because he was “in a very bad place with his own.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old, found his brother after he had taken his own life.
Mrs Davis said, “I am constantly concerned that it has a domino effect.
Ms. Davis created these cards “to let people know that there are people to contact and talk to, even with their friend.
Don’t shut up – you have to talk.
Ms. Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms. Davis for years, lost Mark, his 15-year-old partner, not long after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he was feeling bad or depressed or anything,” he said.
“We noticed a change in his behavior a few days before Christmas.
He was at his lowest point during his first Christmas day – when the children opened his shoes, he had no eye contact with them or anything.
Ms. Humphreys said that the death of a man was a terrible trauma to them, but they have to deal with it: “It will tear the wound into the whole family.
It'll tear us apart.
But we have to go ahead and continue to fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on hair while the FBI starts investigating
“I believed that if we could actually get something he wanted – a limited time and scope study – we might be able to achieve unity,” Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the Committee would “fall together” in the middle of a permanent partisans congestion.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate it?
Their dissatisfaction was due to the time.
The interim elections will only be held in five weeks, on 6 November. If the Republicans do not expect to go well, they will be greatly weakened in their intentions to obtain the highest court in the world.
George W. Bush has taken the phone to call the Senators, doing lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House, and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
The vote will take place in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to give a decisive vote and confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korea's army jockeys is falling – under Kim's government
South Korea's legislation has said that the number of North Korea's troops in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting the data of the Ministry of Harmonisation of South Korea, said that compared to the 2011 military jets (2706), their number has decreased last year (1127).
Mr. Park said that the main factors are stronger border controls between North Korea and China, and a larger number of human traders.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
A large number of North American people have been offered the citizenship of South Korea.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossing the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized area between two Koreas.
China is more about illegal immigrants than refugees and often sends them back to the country with power.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is technically still in war, has improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the abolition of nuclear weapons.
It happened after a historic meeting in June between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-uni in Singapore, where they promised to work in general on a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of lack of progress in sanctions.
“Without believing the United States of America, our country has no security assurance, and in such circumstances we are in no way willing to make ourselves one-sided first armed,” Mr Ri said in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh \"hysterical,\" and said that the man was a judge of the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, president of the opposition of the House of Representatives, appointed Judge-in-Chief Brett Kavanaugh as “hysterical,” and said that the man was under the temper of working as a judge of the Supreme Court.
The game published an opinion on a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I was alarmed that if a woman had been in such a way, she would have been called hysterical,” Pelosi said about her reaction to the testimony given to the Senate’s judicial committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the accusation that he had sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, describing his family and high school years, almost screamed from time to time, and was sometimes unspeakable.
He also expressly condemned the members of the Democratic Party in the Committee, calling the charges against him for the loss of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential elections as an organized “grotess and coordinated reputational murder” of angry liberals.
According to Pelosi, he believes that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that a man is not fit for the Supreme Court judge, as it showed that he has been subject to the opposition of the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with their statements and the way he attacked Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
The Pelosi remained modest when he was asked whether he would try to withdraw him from office if the Democrats were to become a majority in the House of Representatives when he was confirmed by Kavanaugh.
“I say so much – if he doesn’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he’s not only a judge of the Supreme Court, but he’s also not fit in the court where he works,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Court of Appeal of the Columbia District.
He added that he was concerned as a Democrat about the decisions against the potential Affordable Care Act (health law – a comment from the translator) or Roe v. Wade (the author of the abortion) because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation session, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would revoke some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
“It’s not a time when a hysterical tilted person could become a judge and wait for us to say that it’s not great,” Pelosi said.
And women have to wear it.
It is a fair choice of words, a long-lasting hatred of months and years, and he cannot get away without crying about it.
“We cry when we get angry,” said Ms. Steinem 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, or...
He continued: “I got help from a woman who was somewhere in the head; she said that she was crying as well as when she got angry, but she developed a method that stood in that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, “You may think I’m crying because I’m sad.
I'm angry.
And he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant.
Pisars are partly accepted as the output of rage, because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories is one of my early jobs in a majority of men’s offices, where I once found myself crying in unspeakable rage when one older woman – a strict leader I’ve always been a little afraid of – caught in the collar and carried a staircase.
“Never show them how to cry,” he told me.
“They don’t know you’re mad.
They think you're sad, and it offers them satisfaction.
Patricia Schroeder, the then Democratic Party Congress of Colorado, had worked together with Gary Hart on male presidential election campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on a hunt called Monkey Business and ended the campaign, Schroeder was deeply upset that there was no reason why he should not think about running for president himself.
“It wasn’t a well-designed decision,” he told me, laughing 30 years later.
“Juba was nominated for seven candidates, and the last thing they needed was to join someone else.
Someone said it was like, \"The snow white and the seven thumb boys,\"
Since the campaign was over, he was late with the money collection, and he promised he wouldn't run if he didn't get two million dollars.
It was a hopeless battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters who donated $1,000 to men gave him only $250.
“Do they think I’m getting a discount?” he thought.
When he held a speech in which he announced that he would not launch an official campaign, the feelings – thanks to the people who supported him, were irritable against the system that made it difficult to turn to voters instead of the money and delegates, and anger against sexism – he won so much that he came to tears of throat.
“You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled the response to the press against him.
“I could have thought that Cleenex was my sponsorship.
I remember thinking about what they write on my gravestone.
\"He was crying,\"
How the U.S.-China trade war can be useful for Beijing
The US-China trade war openings were scandalous, and although the battle is far from over, the gap between countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
President Donald Trump made a first warning this year by imposing taxes on important Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most important escalation took place this week with new tariffs of $200 billion (150 ml pounds) in value of goods, in essence imposing taxes on half of the Chinese goods coming from the US.
Beijing has answered the same thing at all times, with the last five to ten percent of tariffs of $60 billion in value for American goods.
China has promised the U.S. to respond with the shot wound, and the second largest economy in the world is likely not to blink as soon as possible.
Getting back to Washington would mean giving in to the demands, but publicly in front of the United States, worshiping the Chinese President Xi Jinping would be too embarrassing.
However, experts argue that if Beijing’s cards are correct, trade war with the US can support China in the long term, reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that cause the loss of control over the economy in another country is actually much more dangerous than the bystanders have already admitted,” said the researcher Abigail Grace, who focuses on the study of Asia at the Center for New American Security.
According to the Foreign Minister, Syria is ready to return to refugees.
According to Syria, the country is ready for voluntary return of refugees and calls on the country to rebuild after more than seven years of war.
Speaking with the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country would improve.
“The situation in the country’s territory is more stable and secure due to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to restore normality in the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists.
There are now all the conditions that refugees who have left the country voluntarily may return to the country because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures affecting daily life and living.
According to the UN forecast, 5.5 million Syrians have fled since the start of the war in 2011.
More than six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would gladly accept assistance to build a state.
At the same time, he stressed that the State would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating France near Paris at the Le Golf National Golf Course with the final result of the US team 16.5 vs 10.5.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won Ryder's Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe was crowned once again when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn team received 14.5 points to win the United States.
Throughout the tournament, the US star Phil Mickelson hit the track on the par-3 track in 16 water, giving up the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players who have achieved the tournament in the current 1979 format 5 : 0 : 0 .
The American Jordan Spiethile resulted in a 5&4 deportation of the lowest-ranking Danish Thorbjorn Olenen.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, promoted Ian Poulter with 2 and 1 English, who could have been the last to play the Ryder Cup.
Eight of Ryder's Cup Veteran, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the top winner of the competition in all time.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t hold back today.
It's been a hard year.
I am grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy we got the cup back.
It’s a team spirit and I’m glad to be able to help,” said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He will pass the error on to the co-operative Jon Rahm, who won the American golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 on Sunday.
“I feel the extraordinary pride that I won Tiger Woods – I grew up watching him,” said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a career in Ryder's Cup score of 13 :21 :3.
Strange statistics for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 titles of the grand competition, leaving just Jack Nicklaus behind.
The U.S. team was at the campus to find the Fairway weekend; the exception was Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played a high-level golf in the entire tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after the team’s disappointment, “I’m proud of the guys, they were heartbroken.
There was a moment in the morning when we put pressure on Europeans.
We fought with them.
A hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players did a very good job.
Let's get together, work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and go on.
I love these 12 types and I feel proud to be their master.
You have to lift the hat.
We were better played.
New information on water breeding: decreased concentration in Pinellas, Manatees and Sarasotas
The latest report from the Committee on Fisheries and Nature in Florida (FWC) shows a reduction in the overall concentration of blooming algae in the Gulf of Tampa region.
According to the FWC, there are reports of a weaker flowering in the Provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which indicate decreasing concentrations.
The range of waterfall is approximately 130 miles (209 km) along the coast from the northern part of the Province of Pinellas to the south of the county of Lee.
