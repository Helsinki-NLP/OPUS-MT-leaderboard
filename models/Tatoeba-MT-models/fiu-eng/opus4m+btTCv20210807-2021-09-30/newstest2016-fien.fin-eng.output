A 9-year-old boy in Tampere was found
The police have had a search for a 9-year-old boy on a run in Tampere on Tuesday night.
The disappearance declaration on the boy who left West Camperere with his friend has spread on social media.
According to the police's situation centre, the boy has been contacted and has no risk of life and health.
The son's father told Ilta-Sanom in the half-night knowing that the boy had been found.
He's fine, and now we're going to start the ex-post investigation.
The boy was found in the neighborhood of the home, Dad told me.
Ronaldo again as a charm - tear the paint difference to Messi
Cristiano Ronaldo hit five goals in the Spanish league weekend and continued his factory in the Champions League.
The battle between Lionel Mess and Cristiano Ronaldo from the Champions League was turned to the latter for at least a moment.
Real Madrid Ronaldo went to the top of all-time target statistics when he shot a visitor on Shahar Donetsk's network two hits of penalty kicks and one of the gaming situations.
Ronaldo raised his goal balance to 80 when before Tuesday, the Barcelona Mess had 77 hits.
Real won 4-0.
Juventus has been in the Italian football league at Serie A since the beginning, but in the Champions League's D-section it began with a 2-1 tour race from Manchester City.
The powerless ball made a lot of ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The city's attack was boring because of the absence of the knee-catching Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekend of the election game, arrived in the field only on the last ten minutes of news.
Manchester’s second club, United, also experienced hardship in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after having suffered a 1-2 stroke.
The manU's 20-year-old lawyer Luke Shaw's guest match lasted only a quarter of an hour.
The dangerously looking sliding guarantee of PSV Hector Moreno hit the goal towards the attacked ManU package so badly that Shaw probably broke his leg.
Shaw slept on the Eindhoven home stadium lawn tens of minutes before the medical staff went to carry him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took guests to a 1-0 line in 41 minutes, but the pleasure of ManU lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno leveled up before the break.
In the second half, the PSV’s victory paint was made by Luciano Narsingh.
During the World Cup, Paris Saint-Germain began the A-block.
Manchester United's shirt's PSG knife was replaced by Argentine Angel Di Maria.
Di Maria broke through the right and raised the ball around Malmö's goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made the second half for PSG 2-0.
PSG has been played among the successes of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö is not the best target for comparison.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic, PSG’s astronomer, met for the first time with his professional career’s departure from Malmo FF.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team Moscow TsSKA lost the B-block in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party immediately called for a difference - the president took the wrong speech
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had held a month ago.
President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has again spoken the same speech in the country's parliament at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether Mugabe was 91 years old in full spirit power.
The chief opposition party, MDC, asked Mugabe to resign because this is too old to rule.
Mugabe’s assistants rushed to say that the confusion had happened only in Mugabe’s seat and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech dealt with earlier and now China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an additional summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an additional meeting of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, will assess the request.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how more effective registration could be made in Europe.
Negotiations on asylum seekers are included in the Internal Ministers' table.
The teacher admits that he had shot his girlfriend during an emergency call.
A little bit of a college teacher Shannon Lamb tells the police during an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that the police have to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his “goldish dog” is alive and probably shocked, and said that the contact details of the dead woman’s loved ones can be found on this phone.
Inside the house, the police found Amy Prentiss' body and a message written on the side of the rain: “I’m so sorry that I could cancel this beloved Amy and she’s the only woman who ever loved me,” said in a letter, which, according to experts, was signed by Lamb.
There was nothing to suggest that Lamb, who taught two online courses at the Cleveland Delta State University in Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers to the school campus where the police believed he had shot and killed a history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this workshop.
Officer Lynn Buford at Delta State University told the university staff about shooting at 10.18 p.m.
She said Lamb called a fatal emergency call for some time after that.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths rose to one more: Lamb committed suicide when he was surrounded by police.
The authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb's motive for the day after the students and staff had to hide behind closed doors because of the shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have published information that students and staff described Lamb as a gifted teacher who, however, may have had problems.
Students told me they were waiting for her hours.
The death of the Prentiss, Gauter, says that Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in the book he wrote, where he thanked the wonderful people with whom he shared his academic life.
Both were taught at the Institute of Social Sciences and History, with a total of 17 staff members, and many students attended both courses.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but said that he also seemed nervous and unrested, as if something had been wrong.
Another student, Michael Sykes, said Lambin told him he had a lot of stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked for medical leave from Delta State University, saying she had some kind of health problem.
This year, he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in the University's salary principles meant that even though Lamb had worked hard in front of his doctorate, he did not expect automatic career development and assistant professor's office.
Professor William LaForge said that there was no contradiction between Lamb and Schmidt in order to know, but that, clearly, there was something in Lamb's mind.
These questions are no longer answered by Lamb.
After Lamb had fled the campus, the police got to his track when he moved back to Mississippi from Arkansas State.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the back yard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house in the suburbs of Mississippi Greenville, reported Washington County's death investigator, Methel Johnson.
Lamb's car was still running in the yard.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, even though Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began working at the University in 2009 and taught the field and educational knowledge. The university has 3500 students and is located in a city with around 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb performed a doctoral degree in education in spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as smart, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston told me she was 15 years old and Lamb was 20 years old when they met through shared friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who tried to teach Hairston to play guitar for many years.
He was quite a charm at that time.
All the girls were melting wax when he was there, now said Hairston, a 40-year-old, who lives in Jackson’s suburbs in Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were apparently dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a riverside brick house in Gautier.
The police said the dog was okay.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen told them he divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and now he has a 19-year-old daughter.
He's really shocked, O'Steen described his daughter.
She was her mother's best friend.
O'Steen said she had not met Lamb, but had heard from her daughter, Abigail, that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both appearing on the summer market three years ago.
Later they played together on some gigs.
O'Steen said his daughter would do and sing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different online companies.
The bar bar of The Julep Room, located near Gautier, and the regular entertainment organizer Mike Shaffer, says that he saw Lamb and Prentiss the last night of September 5 when Lamb had finished his guitar and lip-tap performance to a rare audience.
Nothing seemed wrong.
\"Only a happy couple,\" he said.
We were messing with each other.
They were both pretty clever.
The dead teacher Schmidt led the first-year student seminar program and was specialized in Indian and colonial history, told Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher.
Schmidt was married and had three children.
He studied at the University of Emporia State in Kansas and was the spokesperson of his fraternity and student government.
On Tuesday night at the Delta State campus in Cleveland, about 900 people participated, including teaching and other staff, students and members of the community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the exhibition, during which the university choir sang songs from Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The lesson continues on Wednesday.
\"We're trying to get our students back,\" LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
Now is the time to recover.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report to Mississippi Cleveland.
Emily Wagner Pettus from Greenville and Rebecca Santana from New Orleans participated in the report.
The case has been corrected according to the police saying now that Lamb called the emergency call after the shooting of Schmidt, and that even though Lamb referred to Prentis as his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire less employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us says that it does not hire as many employees for the holiday period as last year, but the dealer of toys and baby products says that today’s regular and seasonal workers will be given the opportunity to do more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and distribution centers across the country when the number of people hired in the 2014 holiday period was 45,000.
Most jobs are part-time.
The company said that interviews with applicants will begin this month, and the number of staff will rise from October to December.
Although there are months of holidays, the Christmas shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help in the occupation of stores and in the sale, delivery and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about her date - Princess Diana
Back to the future film was a very important moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also important for personal reasons.
“We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royal arrival, and I realized that I was sitting next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana was next to me,” she said, a future documentary in Back in Time trailer.
The movie begins and I think I'm just a stretch of tea and a stretch of hand from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about the Return to the Future movie interviewed by Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, and directed by Robert Zemeck and producer director Steven Spielberg.
Back to the future, he got his first night 30 years ago.
Spielberg told me, “It’s definitely the best time travel movie ever.
Back in Time is available as a subscription video, DVD and some cinemas in October.
The UN leader says that the situation in Syria will not be resolved as a weapon.
The response of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to Russia's increased military support for Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict is not solved armedly, and the additional weapons only exacerbate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN leader again called on all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unite and support non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
At the Wednesday press conference, Ban announced that he was going to meet with five permanent Member States - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - foreign ministers at the General Assembly in the course of the ministerial week later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted the fact that the Council, the Syrian people and the regional forces had made it impossible to resolve the situation.
Ban called on five permanent Member States to demonstrate the Syrian crisis when discussing the solidarity and consensus they showed in the context of the Iran nuclear programme.
8 comments on support showing that Donald Trump is serious
Some have tried to find him a windmill.
Some people just think he's a joke.
Some are waiting for the collapse.
Although some Republicans have been trying to slow Donald Trump off the top of the polls, it is not (the other) successful.
From the latest 11 national surveys in ten Donald Trump has been in charge of the two-digit century, and some have begun to seriously consider what this means for the purposes of the appointment of the real estate king.
The election is only in the early stages.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to become a Republican candidate.
The comments point out that in 2011, Rick Perry was losing his leadership position to Herman Cain, both of which did not get behind any state in the appointment process.
There are also many reasons why he has problems in general elections.
However, external groups such as the Jeb Bush Super PAC and the conservative Economics Organization Club for Growth have noted Trump’s tightness and began to use their funds to overthrow him.
The following recent evidence of support suggests that the building king is not just a transient phase:
Trump's popularity has made a full translation.
Just before Donald Trump announced his nominations in mid-June, Monmouth University's evidence polls showed that only two Republicans of ten welcomed the estate king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40%.
At the beginning of the film, the figure was 52%.
Currently, six out of ten Republicans welcome Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they are negative.
These figures are also true in the first pre-election states.
In a survey conducted by the University of the Quin market in Iowa last week, 60 percent of Republicans said they welcome Trump.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be pleased if Trump became a candidate.
At CNN/ORC survey last week, 67% of Republicans said they would be either inspired or satisfied if Trump was a candidate.
Only two out of ten said that they would be... shocked if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43%-inspirated – vs. Trump 40%).
Next, the most enthusiastic?
Marco Rubio is only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters would be unsatisfied, or shocked, if they became a candidate for Jeb Bush’s favorites.
The nature of Trump's fire is not a problem for most Republicans.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his powerful speeches and insults, on Monday ABC News/Washington Post-Queen said 52% of Republican-rated voters at national level think that the property king has a good quality for the president.
According to a survey conducted last week by the Quin market, the number of the first party meeting in the Iowa state is the same: 52% of Republicans think Trump has a good character for the leader.
According to the ABC/Post survey, 44% think that his character is not suitable for the president, and almost six out of ten think that his character is not part of the White House.
Republican voters are accustomed to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is a real choice.
According to CNN/ORC survey, four out of ten considered Trump the most likely option to ask who is most likely to be nominated as Republican candidates.
At the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Data disclosure: voters of the Republican Party have not always had the brightest possible crystal ball.
During this last term, four out of ten Republicans agreed that Rick Perry would be nominated as a candidate, and only 28% supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that most Republican voters consider Trump’s campaign credible.
Even if Republicans were to support another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that a sprawl field is likely to have promoted Trump’s leadership, as Trump’s anti-Trump support is divided between numerous other candidates.
However, the survey conducted by Monmouth University at the beginning of September showed that in the hypothetical bilateral competition between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump receives a majority of support in almost all cases.
He leads to Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubita with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points and Rand Paul, John Kasichi and Chris Christie with 33 points each.
He's in touch with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to win Trump?
If they were put in the opposite position, Ben Carson would win Trump with an 18 points difference.
Just and just a majority of Donald Trump’s supporters have said they have made a decision.
A new CBS/NYT survey on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of Trump voters have decided who their voices go.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can absolutely say that they would never change their mind.
46% said they could possibly change candidates.
In any case, Trump's biggest competitor is currently another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made a decision are twice as likely to be on Trump's side.
Six out of ten Republicans say Trump agrees with immigration.
Since Donald Trump, two months ago, called the Mexican immigrants \"smurders\" in his campaign analysis, immigration has been at the heart of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump’s power concentration drives latino voters further away from the Republican Party and damages rebranding companies.
According to a new ABC/Post survey published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of things, so is Donald Trump.
The collapse of the government has reached a new peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson’s support now covers about half of Republican voters, largely due to their position outside politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said Monday in the ABC/Post survey that they prefer to choose a person outside politics rather than a person with a government experience.
They are also angry with the federal government.
A two-week study from Des Moines Register/Bloomberg on Iowa showed that three of the four Republicans of Iowa are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54% are unsatisfied, and 21% are really angry.
Jeremy Corbyn's first meeting at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first appearance in the survey hour has been looking forward to his election.
Jeremy Corby, the new president of the Labour Party, will meet David Cameron for the first time in a poll.
Corby comes up to ask about his first six questions a little after noon, and probably both media and Labour Party MPs closely watched his performance.
Corbyn has called for this weekly show – less theatre and more facts –
He also said that he could leave some of the events for his colleagues to take care of.
This meeting is the first parliamentary test for Corbyn’s leadership after he was appointed to the shadow government and spoke at the annual meeting of the Trade Unions Central Organization on Tuesday.
At the same time, the decision of the leader of the Labour Party to stand quietly during the national song on Tuesday in the service of the commemorative worship, which was held on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the British War, has raised a review of the Conservative Party on the Members of the People's Party and appeared in a number of front pages.
Corbyn's decision not to sing a national song has attracted attention.
Corbyn's representative said in a respectful silence to his status, and that he recognizes the courage of the Royal Air Forces in the Great Britain's War.
Corbyn’s shadow government member, Owen Smith, said to the BBC Two News program that he would have called the Labour Party leader to sing a national song, despite the fact that he thought the royal room should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to be involved in Corbyn's internal circle, calling for differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs. In the beginning, less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC’s policy spokesman Robin Brant says that the differences in line between the position of the parties in the European Union and the government’s ceiling have become “recovery” – also within the Labour Party after the appointment of Corbyn.
Corbyn said that the Labour Party would present a change that would remove the entire roof.
For hours later, Secretary of Labour and Pensions of the shadow government, Smith said that the party was – quite clear – that they only opposed the government’s plans to calculate the ceiling from 26,000 pounds to 23 0,000 pounds.
Corbyn becomes the fifth leader of the Labour Party, which David Cameron has met in the last decade, when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the Labour Party has promised a new approach to politics and now tells us that he has been \"incarnated\" ideas for questions to the Prime Minister and received more than 30,000 proposals.
Islington North's MP Corbyn has said that the nature of the Prime Minister's polls is too controversial and that he is going to refrain from both clever speech and piling, instead focusing on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and youth challenges.
Corbyn has said that the shadow government's economic secretary Angela Eagle works as his substitute for questioning hours when Corbyn is not involved - for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Corbyn has also proposed that other colleagues should be able to speak sometimes, and he has said that he has approached the sub-room president, John Bercow, from the team.
When Cameron got in charge in 2005, he said he wanted to move further away from a political theater that was often associated with the Prime Minister’s polls, but later he had to admit that he failed.
Since the start of television in 1990, the prime minister’s survey has been an important meter in assessing the discretion of the manager, the management of his sub-room, as well as his position with other representatives, even though critics have criticized the polls for the fact that they have become just an irritable picture that requires far-reaching reforms.
Photographed in Joburg: Homeless young people are trained as photographers
It is a difficult place to be homeless in Johannesburg.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and make a living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a nonprofit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take photos of their neighborhood and get a profit from it.
BBC News met one of the young people who graduated from the first project.

The value of the pound increases as the UK wage growth rises
At the same time, the FTSE 100 index rose with SABMiller.
Between May and July, Britain's wages, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9 per cent compared to the same time last year.
The growth rate was fastest after 2009, and it was considered to bring with it estimates of the increase in the rates.
The cost rose by over 1% to $1.5505, and 0.84% to EUR 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index was closed at an increase of 1.49 per cent to read 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinguished share on the market and rose by 20% after the competitor AB InBev approached it with a bid.
The agreement would combine two of the world’s largest breweries and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artis, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry’s share rose by 0.9 per cent after receiving encouraging news from the competing luxury group Richmont.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China, which is Burberry's key market, had started to grow again.
Glencore’s shares rose by 5% after the mining waste said it had raised $2.5 billion by launching shares as part of its debt cutting strategy.
Packing and Paper Group Mondi’s shares were the biggest calculators of the index, 4.3% after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation from company to company-to-sale.
JD Sports rose by 3.1 per cent after the sports clothing company announced half a year before taxes: 83 per cent rise to 46.6 million.
According to the CEO of JD Sports, higher wages can damage enlargement
Peter Cowgill, CEO of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage for employees is increased in the UK, it can mean that the purchasing power of potential consumers increases.
However, this purchasing power is not likely to exceed higher labour costs for the company, Cowgill says.
The costs could be focused on the company’s enlargement plans, he added, which would mean less extra jobs.
Metcash launches a grass-rooted campaign against the intrusion of Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA trades from Aldi's attack in South and West Australia.
Metcash, a food wholesaler, has launched a grass-rooted campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in South and West Australia before an attack of $700 million in Aldin.
Aldi prepares for the opening of two distribution centres and the first trading in South and West Australia next year, with up to 120 trades. At the same time, Metcash and IGA-supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build an IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing, as well as through events such as Adelaide Show.
IGA’s traders and buyers have jumped, and brands such as Dunsborough ice cream manufacturers Simmo’s offer taste in IGA stores, and shop owners sell discount-price tickets to Australian football matches to their suppliers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details about his defence strategy on September 29, when this wholesaler of food, alcohol and iron goods arranges the annual investor’s strategy day.
There is a lot in the game, as South and West Austria account for almost 30% of the Metcashi IGA trading area, with higher returns margins than the IGA network of the eastern States of Metcashi.
In South and West Australia, visitors are well known for shopping in the corner, and IGA dealers have a much higher market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30% in the south and 24% in the west compared to 14% in the Eastern States.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi catches about 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of the first movements.
In this week's report, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA dealers can lose 360 million dollars per year in sales and Metcash can lose 250 million dollars by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open up to 25 in the south next year and 30 in the west, which will generate net sales of $500 and $600 million in these areas.
Loss of food and food sales and amounts at Metcashi’s high fixed cost base can cost Metcash about $13 million in operating losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in Eastern states mainly to Ald and Coles, although the recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA customers were the most loyal of all.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcashi's food and food sales will fall by 3.8% in 2016; 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, with its market share falling from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, the manager of the leading investment fund and the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglass, said during a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could possibly be lost in the decade.
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglas's comments.
However, it has been understood that the Board member of Metcashi would have contacted Douglas last week.
IGA’s market share has fallen from 18% to 14% since 2010, and revenues from Metcashi’s food and food business, which transfers products to around 1200 IGA dealers, have decreased by 43% since 2012. This indicates a reduction in the debt financing of operations when the sales and margins are under pressure.
However, the wholesaler retains half, and has invested more than $150 million a year in reducing the prices of hundreds of products per week to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA dealers to repair stores by increasing faster fresh food, as well as bringing better products of private brands to the market.
Metcashi's CEO, Ian Morrise, says that the price reduction and the improvement of stores have increased the attractiveness, and he hopes that the wholesaler will return to the road to the growth of revenues in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Steve Healy, President of the Australian Tennis Federation, supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more honor than criticism of his conduct
Thanasi Kokkinakis has had to suffer from the recent storm, which has raged around his friend Nick Kyrgios. He deserves more honor than criticism of his own behavior, says Steve Healy, president of the Australian tennis union.
\"The talented two younger members named \"Special Ks\", Kokkinakis, was unwittingly exposed to a case where Kyrgios irritated Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters competition.
Soon after that, in a fiery battle in Cincinnati, the chief judge had to split Kokknakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, when Harrison declared: \"Wawrinka should have beat Kyrgios, and I should have beat that cocoa.
Although the last time the cook was seen breaking up his mail after the crash ruined his potential victory from Richard Gasquet in the US Open, Healy has been an incapacitary defender of the cookish.
Right now, a young man in Glasgow is competing with Sam Groth in two games with Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
“I’m pretty sure that Thana has just been dragged into a mess,” Healy said.
He broke his mail when he lost his hand in the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his mail when he got frustrated, and I know Thanas well enough to know that he's not proud of it.
But he has behaved well, also in relatively provocative situations in the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he has been treated a little harshly.
He is very mature at the age of 19, he works hard, fits into the team and so on, and he never had any problems with other players. He is appreciated in the dressing room, he exercises firmly, is in good condition and is quite calm and mature young man, and I think he should be evaluated according to his merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Kyrgio in important games starting on Friday, describing this - a joint decision - for a good solution for everyone, but still supporting the return of the Canberrana to the team's stability.
“We want the team to be fully focused on games and not around everything else,” Healy said.
And Nick has grown up very quickly, as Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he grows up in the public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received. However, we try to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe that it is best for both the team and him if he spend some time thinking about the consequences.
European immigration crisis: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary declared the state of emergency and closed its anti-Serbiary border to arrest those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of a dam on the flow of migrants coming to the country.
There was chaos at the border when hundreds of immigrants gathered in an impartial area, and the Serbian authorities responded with shock.
The people who fled the violence of their own countries have now erected their tents and have set themselves on the road for an indefinite period of time between the control stations of the two countries.
However, vanity grew.
While the police helicopter remained above them, the immigrants were jogging, “Open the border and shouted insults to the Hungarian mellakkapolis.
Some refused food and water to protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared that it was impossible to accept the return of migrants from Hungary when they received more from Macedonia and Greece all the time.
\"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not harming civilians.
The debate will have to be held in the near future with other countries and Brussels,\" Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The Sekasorto on the border between Hungary and Serbia was born following the failure of the 28 national groups to establish a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the allocation of responsibilities for 40,000 people seeking asylum, who have now taken over Italy and Greece. Ministers expressed their hope of reaching the final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - about which EU countries will take 120 000 additional refugees, including part of Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria call for an additional EU summit next week to discuss the migration crisis of the continent.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will act in the near future.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation in the two southern regions gave the authorities greater powers to act in the crisis and allowed you to be closed and asylum cases could be accelerated.
At the same time, the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the aid at the border with Serbia is complete, the country is also going to set up its border against Romania in order to stop immigrants from flooding through the country.
CBS News's correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports that even prisoners had been recruited to complete the Piicca River between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and the European Union's refugees, many of which are in war on Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that the majority of incoming economic refugees are seeking a better life and not those fleeing from war who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly in conflict with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force on midnight in Hungary, now define as a crime the attempt to cross or damage a 4-meter (13 feet) wire fence, built by the government on the southern border against Serbia, and include longer prison sentences for convicted people.
“As a result of the situation of mass migration, the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency, the government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told journalists in the southern Szeged city.
We are very clear about this: crossing the limit of the law is a crime.
Parliament must continue to formally accept the planned military assemblance next week, but the Associated Press's suppliers at the border have seen the heavily armed military personnel with their vehicles and dogs for many days.
The security adviser of the home country of Orban, Gyorgy Bakondi, said that the authorities had captured 45 people in their attempt to cross the border, and 15 more than they had reached the country.
They got over by harming the fence, are now captured by the police, and they are accused of the violations specified in the new laws.
The authorities quickly repair the fence.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossings from the border against Serbia after they had sent a train wagon hidden on the wire to close one of these places.
The main border crossing site near Hungary's Roskea was covered in chaos when Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for the treatment of people and the crowds were invading inside.
About 20 people got in, but thousands were out.
One group of immigrants blocked the main engines between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they refuse to drink and drink until they are allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 elections: According to National Survey, Hillary Clinton's leadership in Bernie Sanders has narrowed on the side
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues in a two-digit leader in the Democrats' nominations, but Senator Bernie Sanders is holding him up.
Clinton now supports 47% of Democrats (decreased 58%), and the second Sanders support 27% (up 17%).
The Vice President, Joe Biden, has not yet announced whether he will go to the presidential race, but he is supported by 15% of the Democrats.
Over five months before the beginning of the elections, most of the Democrats say it is too early to say that they would have decided who they would vote for.
Clinton’s supporters, however, stand behind their choice more tightly than other candidates.
Clinton’s popularity has fallen in several population groups since last month’s CBS News Poll survey, and at the same time Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is heavily led by women and moderates, but his leadership has narrowed down.
His popularity with men has decreased considerably, and Sanders has only 5 percentage points left.
Clinton's first trip to Democratic voters under the age of 50 has disappeared, and he's now on the level with Sanders.
Clinton, however, clearly leads to older voters.
In the last month Clinton led Sanders in a double-digit century with liberals, but now Sanders leads this group by five percent.
About half of the country's Democrats say they support Clinton with enthusiasm if he becomes a party candidate.
The fourth says he supports him with certain reservations, and 15 percent would support him only because he is a candidate.
Six percent would not support him at all.
It is not surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are very likely to be excited about his support.
The opinions are more confused with those who do not currently support Clinton - only one quarter would support him with enthusiasm.
When 48% of Democrats say they would be supportive of Clinton, the Republican first man Donald Trump said the same thing about a smaller Republican voter (35%).
When Clinton’s supporters were asked why they wanted him to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that he had the right experience (16%). The most popular answers were that now is the right time for the female president (13%) and that he was the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton’s supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Since the Vice President has an impact on a possible presidential nomination, 57% of Democrats would like to see him already in the race - although a third disagrees.
When asked by Democrats who they would choose second party appointment, Biden is the most popular choice.
Over half of Clinton’s supporters say they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to reach the candidate of the Democrats, Hilary Clinton's leadership from Sanders will increase. If Biiden leaves, the management will be 20 percentage points, but if he leaves, the number will be 30.
55% of Democrats believe Clinton has the best chance to win presidential elections, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
With this measure, Biden will remain far away, but the proportion of those who keep him the most vocal has increased.
When the Democrats were asked what was most important in the candidate, they nevertheless raised opinions above the voteability.
In the last month, no candidate or potential candidate was considered an impossible candidate for these voters.
Candidates of Democrats or potential candidates will be able to cope well with certain key issues among the voters of their party.
The majority consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden as the most honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden can do three best in honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of Democrats say Clinton does not consider it honest and reliable, twice as much as Sanders (15%), but 27% say they have no opinion of Sanders.
Democrats also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden agree ideologically.
When we look at all these aspects, about a quarter of Democrats say they have no opinion about Sanders.
While the use of Hillary Clinton’s personal e-mail address and server when he was a foreign minister still raises questions, most of the Democrats are satisfied with his explanation of the matter and say that the matter did not affect their public opinion about him.
However, it is different when we consider America as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
The opinion of the people was distributed shortly in March after it came to light.
Most Americans say that the e-mail polychemist did not influence their overall opinion on Clinton, although 36% say that their opinion on him has become worse.
More than six out of ten Republicans say their opinion on Clinton has become worse.
While Clinton's own party voters consider him honest and reliable, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters. Only 32% consider him honest and reliable, and this figure has decreased by 8 percentage points since last month and 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say Clinton doesn’t think it is honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55 per cent of the country’s registered voters do not consider Trump to be honest and reliable.
Both Clinton and Trump are considered good leaders.
Six of the candidates in the study, Bidenia, Carsonia and Bush, are considered to be the most honest.
Sanders are generally considered honest, but many have no opinion of him, just like Carson.
The error margin for a study involving 351 Democrats is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in a national survey
Ben Carson will be near Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
The two candidates gathered half of all the votes in the new survey, leaving others to fight for the pedestrian.
Republican voters are still strongly supporting Trump, whose support has risen from 23% of the CBS survey of last month's Fox News polls on Tuesday to 27%.
At the same time, Carson rose from 6 to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well with different demographic groups and is being bypassed by Trump's higher-level Republican voters.
The rest of the field have remained behind, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Governor John Kasichi of Ohio.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are ranked in a third position in 6%.
The error margin in the sample of this latest survey of 376 Republican voters in September is +/-6%.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week showed Carson to be in a rising survey: he has 19% support for Republicans, and Trump is 32% ahead of him.
Also, according to the latest ABC News/Washington Post survey, Trump was significantly ahead of Carson.
In Carson's popularity last week, Trump criticized retired neurosurgeons for no reason, even though Carso apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
\"We need energy,\" Trump said last Saturday on his campaign visit to Iowa.
Five brothers are accused of the death of the first year student at Baruch College.
Almost two years after the student died in the Brotherhood Simputseremony in the Pennsylvania Pocono Mountains area, the murder charge has been raised against five people.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi, a New York University in New York City, were brutally assaulted by Chun-Michael-Deng during the membership dispute in September 2013, and then delayed taking him to the hospital, thus contributing to his death, the police said.
The authorities say that Deng's eyes were tied and his back was loaded with over 13 kilos of sand, after which he was repeatedly beaten to the ground when he tried to walk through the ice field towards the paint.
In the end, Deng complained that his head would hurt, after which he lost consciousness.
The members of the Brotherhood did not call the emergency number after Deng passed away, but, according to the accusations, they waited an hour before they brought him to the hospital, the police said.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, search for online information about his symptoms, and contact the Brotherhood's national president Andy Mengi, asking this advice, police chief Chris Wagner told the press conference.
\"This is where the members began to hide their ritual equipment, and in practice placed the well-being of the Brotherhood before Michael Deng,\" the police chief Wagner said.
Deng was not allowed to visit, and he died the next morning.
According to the physiology protocol, Deng received repeated dull objects attacks on his head, body, and travel.
“A lot of families have had to suffer from brotherhood, when at least one student has died every year since 1970, Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family,” said in a statement.
Brothers and their members must be held accountable, and this step of authorities is important.
The great jury in Monroe County agreed that the first five members would be charged with murdering the third degree.
32 other members of the brotherhood, including Meng, are also accused of violent blackmail and criminal plotting.
“We don’t want to be held accountable only for individuals. If there’s an organisation behind the incident that has been formally or informally approved, they should also be held accountable,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national fraternity from being in contact with the local department.
This is what happens when the US Central Bank raises interest rates
The rise in interest rates will come, and the emerging market will fall, the returns of bonds will rise, and the economy will have to slow down.
That's what we know.
What we don’t know is how long it’s going to take or how long it will take.
The past does not give much help in terms of timing, which comes specifically to the economy.
The return has lasted only 11 months since the first increase, and sometimes it has gone as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the US Central Bank in raising interest rates has often been, although not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
Therefore, U.S. Central Bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on it because interest rates are being raised, but mainly on the development cycle of the time that is going to normalize the situation.
There are a number of variables in the equation.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all interest-related evaporations have been overstated.
“The first post-global increase in the Central Bank will inevitably be interpreted in some circles to end the “bad money” era,” said Julian Jessop, a leading economic expert in global affairs in Capital Economics.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal, although still low, there is a revolutionary shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that it has no effect.
Below is an overview of how some areas of the economy will respond based on past developments:
As has been seen in the market in the last few months, waiting for interest rates to rise can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not so dramatic.
\"It seems that the return on capital has a tendency to stop for 12-24 months after the first increase, which may reflect a delay in monetary policy,\" the Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what would happen after the central bank's increase.
More specifically, in the last 35 years, the market is generally strong, with an increase of about 14%, 250 days after that, the situation is fairly steady (average 2.6%), and the normal state has been reached after 500 days with an average return of 14.4% in the last six cycles, according to the recent analysis by Bob Doll, the leading capital strategy of Nuveen Asset Management, which was published in the Barron's magazine.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on shares is generally clearer at a later stage of the growth cycle when the returns start to fall.
Recoverys are part of economic life, but interest rates often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges that have not been faced before and can accelerate the recession.
This is especially the gross domestic product, which will be the closest to the lowest level of all time before the interest rate of the central bank.
According to Deutsche Bank, the annual GDP of 118 increases since 1950 has only been less than 4.5%.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent, it rarely believes it will remain when the third quarter has progressed by 1.5 per cent, according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.
The increase in interest rates in such a fragile economic situation can be risky and raises the question of whether this time is different, Deutsche Bank said.
The market participants have been prepared for the increase of the central bank throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategies and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept an increase at this meeting, future trade is expected to be only 25% likely.
“Our research shows that since 1950, all growth cycles have so far been experiencing an increasing leverage effect in supercycles, where GDP has passed its peaks very quickly after recovery has started,” the report reports.
On the other hand, there has been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst of the period of observation.
In the current cycle, the central bank has been waiting far more than ever for the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and now the 74th month is running.
The flat-rate return has also been unstable as the market waits for interest, and the model reminds me of some of the observations made on capital.
The main difference is that when the central bank changes its line, its effects appear faster in bonds than in shares.
The direction of the returns on bonds appears to be changing immediately for the first increase/surgery of the cycle.
At the end of the interest cycle, the return on bonds will immediately fall,\" Deutche Bank said.
Charles Schwab's strategies believe that raising interest rates will result in the convergence of incomes in longer and shorter-term debt securities, thus balancing the return curve.
High-income bonds often produce better in such a situation, although we are still cautious about looking for a return, Schwab’s solid income analyst, Kathy Jones, said in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank’s orientation expectations.
“In addition to Doll’s strength and the fall in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to a more stringent monetary policy – he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the return curve is more stable, credit margins have increased and instability has increased - all of these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its lines.
Generally speaking, companies whose business is mainly located in the United States win when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multi-national companies with a lot of debt do worse when the rise in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive in the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than they have funding.
“Historia shows that ‘high-quality’ shares are generally more profitable in the first three months after the interest rate – the analysts of Goldman Sachs stated in their report to customers.
Companies with strong turnover exceeded the average of five per cent after the rises in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatility shares were better than low-quality companies. The average first of these was 4 ( percentage points) and 3 ( percentage points).
The debt becomes a big problem.
Those companies that owe a lot of variable interest rates are losing the most, Goldman said.
In addition, outside the stock market industry, consumers have the opportunity to benefit from the rise in the value of the dollar.
Savings can also gain profit with higher incomes, even though experts disagree with how quickly the impact feels.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says.
Conservative Chancellor Andrew Bingham accuses the Channel-Teaching.
He claims that the distinction between a commercial competitor becomes more and more difficult.
In addition, he took the BBC Music Awards, saying that they only imitate the British Awards
Damian Collins criticizes The Voice, saying that it is not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is going to become a classic FM, claiming a leading representative, adding the pressure of the production company to prove that it does something that commercial production companies do not do.
Andrew Bingham, the Conservative Commissioner, also told BBC’s leaders that the public service radio channel seemed to be ‘observable’ and that it was increasingly difficult to distinguish from commercial competitors.
“It’s hard that Radio 3 - I don’t want to use the term ‘citizen’ - is changing into Classic FM,” he said.
He also took his goal at the BBC Music Awards Awards, which was launched last December.
“The BBC Music Awards that started last year seem to be just under a different name from the British Awards.
So if you're trying to do something different, here's two examples that I've directly remembered when you actually just copied something you already found on the market, Bingham said.
BBC’s CEO denied the accusations, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is a lot ahead of its commercial competition partner when it comes to live music and sharing information with citizens.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I can’t learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is actually first-class.
“In addition, I think it’s really important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works,” he said.
Earlier this year, the head of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel had to do more work than before to reach the audience, because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC’s offer, which was criticized for entering the toes of commercial competitors during the hearing of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Member of the Conservative Tory Party, Damien Collins, criticized The Voice, a music competition bought by BBC from the Dutch production company Talpa Media, estimated to be 22 million pounds.
Do you understand why this program is often discussed because it is not original and is not unique?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 channel program, where Palma Faith and Boy George are star judges, has been produced in the BBC style of the Varst.
He added that he wanted a production company to find success inside his own house the next time it starts a entertainment series.
However, he did not agree to prevent future The Voice seasons from being produced, or to determine that the money of the licensors would be used for other forms of entertainment.
Online sales rose to the very least in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Online sales rose by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
Last month there was a rise after the start of the low statistics in 2000
Three years ago, online sales confirmed the use of mobile devices to make purchases
Experts believe that November’s Black Friday may curb consumption
Virtual shopping has grown dramatically for over a decade and many of the UK’s shopping wars have turned into ghost shops.
However, experts say that there are now signs of a level playing field in the air when the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
The total cost of the film grew least since the start of the statistics in 2000: only five per cent rise last year.
Experts say there are signs of a level playing field when the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
“If we look at the growth levels of previous years and come back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would be well-founded over the course of time, Andy Mulcahy, a supplier of the JMRG sales index, told Guardian.
He explained that three years ago, online sales were strengthened when buyers began using their mobile phones for shopping.
It meant that more people made purchases online, and that they could be made in different environments, such as the couch.
But now it is levelled, and (increase) can be reduced.
The Black Friday phenomenon from America has been considered one of the reasons behind the slow trades.
Experts believe that consumers are controlling purchases before the last Friday of November.
Last year, the usual average of five times more buyers ferries to their computers to grab shops, pouring out many merchant websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, who made buyers argue about the findings, can control the shopping process.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one pound of five was used online.
In the case of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now made in online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes from the net instead of using the fashion chains of shopping streets.
Muslims bury the dead in Meka's crane crash, Bin Laden's family for sanctions
Muslims carried 29 dead bodies across the streets during the first funerals in Meka
Saudi Arabia has partially accused the collapse of building waste Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured when the crane fell down.
29 dead were carried through the streets when hundreds of Muslims gathered together to bury them. Victims died when the crane collapsed in Meka’s big jammer.
Mostly, the white-dressed mortals filled the route to honor the first dead who made their last trip to the cemetery of Al-Moaisem.
The sad passage passed the holy place, where only a few days ago the crane fell through the roof of the Mosque and poured out the worshipers.
The bodies were released to be buried when the king of Saudi Arabia confirmed that the Bin Laden family was guilty of a disaster in which 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of 29 worshipers killed by the cranes that fell in Meka’s big jammer were carried along the streets.
Among the dead, the father of four children was Qasim Akram from Bolton to Manchester.
Akram had been in a big shop with his parents before the beginning of the annual climax.
The Saudi authorities have already swore that the crack of Mecca will continue as thousands of people arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that Binladin Group should not have left the crane up when it was not in use.
The decision published by the Saudi Press Agency, led by the state, in the Arabic version, said that Binladin Group is partly responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the News Office did not mention this detail, but it said that the company’s leaders are prohibited from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman swore to find out what led to the fall of the cranes in the yard of the great mosaic, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered before the later dawning of this month.
Binladin Group has not published reports of the collapse of the cucumbers and its representatives have not been arrested for commenting.
The royal decision also accused the group of not using up-to-date safeguards and did not cooperate with the meteorological authorities.
There are dozens of pickups around Meka’s big shop, which are part of a huge construction strike led by Binladin Group.
Binladin’s family has been close to Saudi Arabia’s governing family for decades and has led to large construction projects.
Al Qaeda’s late leader Osama bin Laden was a rebellious boy whose family banned in the 1990s.
The Romahtus happened with windy and rainy weather only days before millions arrive in the kingdom for pilgrimage, which each capable Muslim must do at least once in his life.
The authorities say that 158 people are still in hospital.
The authorities ordered a million litres (174,000 pounds) to be paid to the deceased’s family and permanently injured.
The others will receive half of this amount.
The B&Q boss says that the workers working on the cheap side of the Eastern Europeans are behind popularity.
British people are increasingly using assistant services, Veronique Laury says.
The number of professionals coming from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a result, Screwfix stores for professionals will be opened 200 more
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores around the country
Writer Rupert Steiner, the city’s main writer to Daily Mail
The British say they give up their hammers and paint guns and hire more skilled Eastern European workers to do homework.
It seems that if you are clever with a hammer or start painting walls, you are now in a minority.
British people are increasingly hiring assistants to take care of tea-it-it-self work in their homes, according to B&Q’s boss.
The new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the home repair chain, said that the popularity behind it is the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and that they offer their services at a scoff price.
This results in Kingfisher planning to open 200 new Screwfix stores for workers and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said she wanted more women to work in B&Q stores, because eight out of 10 shopping decisions are made by the most beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that the changes in the population must be taken into account: today there are more than one woman’s economies, where more homework is done than before.
Laury said: “The vast majority of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to find a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of the purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Laury is one of the only five women leading to the UK’s FTSE100 index. He has restructured his management team in such a way that there are as many men and women in it.
Kingfisher is almost the only company with a group of up to 50% of women, including its Director General and Financial Director.
Laury said, \"This was a conscious decision - the difference here is an important thing.
It has not been difficult to find good women in the management team.
Kingfisher reported the invoice at both half-years of output and sales after the group took the cost of closing stores.
As a result of Trend, Kingfisher, owned by Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new movements
The government decided to resort to forced legislation to save the country's economy.
The apparent effects were achieved quite quickly.
The sharp head of the SAK and other remuneration center organisations began to be forced immediately, and as a result, the country stands on Friday because of the extensive manifestation of workers.
A lot of people think that there is reason too.
Let's ask if it's worth the strike when it's bad anyway.
Even a resistance movement has been established.
More than 50,000 people have already reported that they are not going to participate in the demonstration, but are going to work.
This would have been impossible for an old consensus.
Of course, there was nothing on the internet to protest, but openly declaring a wealth of wealth would have been a small human political suicide.
A few tens of thousands of people protest a lot, but it is the cause of thinking.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as obvious as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed.
From the point of view of the interest of the action of the Ay movement, the harsh solutions of the government can also be seen as a direct gift of heaven.
When things have seemed to be rolling with their own weight for years, it is now in the associations that will finally be able to defend the rights of the employee, visiblely and properly.
Thus, the government may want to enforce the role of the Ay movement, when membership in the Trade Union is perhaps seen as more necessary than ever.
We are committed to any action by organizations, so it is a fool that the expression of Friday would somehow stop Finland.
Finland has stopped for a long time.
For example, industrial production has fallen for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product will continue to decline and unemployment will rise.
I think these things would force everyone's head.
For the University of Lappeenranta, a heavy savings economy: Objective 8.5 million savings, staff reduction in 130
The technical University of Lappeenranta will start a savings course aimed at reducing expenses by a total of 8.5 million euros.
As part of the savings, the University will start the negotiations on the entire personnel, with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, it means reducing around 130 employees.
In addition, two million other activities are being saved.
The 2016 budget is based on the YT negotiations, which anticipates the actual operation to be 8.5 million deficits.
This will also be affected by the cuts in the budget made by the government.
During this financial period, the University will make about 2.6 million deficit results.
The costs will increase slightly next year, but at the same time the financing from the Ministry will be reduced by 2 million euros and other funding by 3.2 million euros.
The total budget of the university is around 85 million euros, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The interaction between mass teaching and research cuts and the reduction of corporate funding to our university is very important, says Director Anneli Pauli in a statement from the University.
Before the summer, the impact of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but the reduction in the additional funding now appears in the new scales.
Negotiations with the Trustees will be launched next week on Tuesday and will last six weeks prescribed by law.
Yle: Happybus wants Finnish railways
The owner of the low-cost bus company Onnibus, British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company is also targeting rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in taking part in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the UK’s largest railway companies, Souter says.
Rail traffic should be gradually opened up to competition.
The first is the close transport of the capital region in 2017-2018.
After a short journey, there is a long-distance traffic.
Souter says he has already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the plans of Onnibus are welcomed.
Other international companies have reported their interest in rail transport at least Transdev (former Veolia), which also has bus traffic in Finland and rail traffic in other parts of Europe.
The U.S. Central Bank must make decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world follows from the page when the US Central Bank meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time for almost a decade.
When Reuters carried out a survey of 80 economists with little more than half of those who still believed the central bank would raise interest rates last week, they now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and that the interest rates are maintained at the current level of 0-0.25%.
This is a historical event, because when the central bank cut the interest rates to zero, it is seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central central central bank has the opportunity to get out of zero and start normalising interest rates,\" said Angel Ubide, the Senior Fellow of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has worked relatively well, and recovery has brought balance sheets of dollars and created little inflation.
However, the Central Bank cannot ignore less of the rustic global outlook.
It has warned the market that they should be ready to rise, but signs show that they also believe that the odds are against the rise.
The decision will be published on Thursday at 20.00 (CET).
Delta State University's shooter left an apology message
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning, before shooting his colleague later on the same day, Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying that he was, \"in the first murder,\" and hoped that he would cancel it, the authorities told him Tuesday.
Mississippi Gautier Police reported that Delta State University’s road and social science teacher Lamb called the emergency number about 10 a.m.
Monday, he told me he'd shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police had to send constables to his home.
He said, \"He killed his wife last night,\" and also mentioned that there was a dog in the house, which, no one's, but he's probably shocked.
The police asked the caller this name, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't give me an explanation for shooting.
When the police got there, the body of the 41-year-old Amy Prentiss was found and a message written by the 45-year-old Lamb, saying, \"I'm so sorry that I could cancel it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me.
After writing a message, Lamb ran nearly 500 kilometers to Delta Statee, where he killed historian Ethan Schmidt before eventually killed himself on a late Monday when he was surrounded by a police officer.
Professor William LaForge said that there was no contradiction between Lamb and Schmidt in order to know, but that, clearly, there was something in Lamb's mind.
The authorities said Tuesday that, despite the allegations published on Monday that Lamb would have believed Prentiss had been in relation to Schmidt, there was no “law or evidence” from any of the third parties.
Shawn O'Steen told me he was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as a good person.
A couple broke up 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentis had a 19-year-old daughter who's been shocked.
O'Steen told me that Prentiss and his daughter were the best friends they ever had.
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked at his home by hand online. Sun Herald said that Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
\"He always wanted to help other people,\" Knowles said.
The police told their relatives that Lamb would call somewhere to meet Monday to tell them that she wouldn't go to prison.
When the police hit Lamb's highway 1, near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car off the road, left it there and went running to the forest where he shot himself.
Lamb argued about education in Delta State in spring 2015, explains the CV on the University website.
The stars that lost their charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has been tough in recent years.
In 2001, he had leukaemia, and in 2009, his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
According to rumors, he also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this really requires its taxes.
Manchester United Luke Shaw is out for months because of a double fracture
Luke Shaw had a double fracture in his right leg when Manchester United lost PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League.
Although the defender remained in tears and has been out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw would be able to play again this season.
The injury caused the unsuspected guarantee of Héctor Moreno in 15 minutes after the 20-year-old Shaw had fallen into the area of the PSV.
He was treated in the field for 9 minutes and had to give him oxygen before taking him to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, \"He has a double fracture on his feet and now he's in the hospital.
He will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day after that, and then cut in Manchester.
This is terrible. The boy comes to Manchester United at the age of 18, suffers from difficulties and then plays brilliantly, and this is what happens now.
When I was in the locker room, he was wearing a oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but it takes at least half a year for a double fracture, and he's not playing in the block phase.
I hope he can play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he got a red card and a penalty shot.
Ertuomar Nicola Rizzoli did not rank a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian editor was mistaken.
You can judge the situation when I say it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a very bad two-legged hit.
Shaw tweeted as follows: “Thanks to all your messages, the words are not enough to tell me how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I will return stronger,
Related: Manchester United suffers from Luke Shaw’s case and loses to PSV
The English defender has an additional incentive to recover next June’s European Championships in France.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said: “It’s a really bad injury.
If a player gets out because of this kind of injury, everyone is very sad.
The goal of our players is never to offend the opponent.
Moreno’s foot broke when he played in Mexico’s team against Van Gaal’s Holland in the 2014 World Championships.
\"Moreno takes this hard because it's not meant to hurt the opponent, and when he hears that the injury is really bad, it's bad,\" Cocu said.
I didn't see it in that situation.
The only thing I saw was the ball that was going in a different direction, so it seemed like he [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn’t see Luke’s coat.
Moreno said to SBS6: “I know how it feels, I know how difficult it can be.
I feel terrible about this, I'm so sorry.
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after Chris Smodeling's challenge.
David Cameron knows this better than Lorax.
Each parent will soon learn one thing: if your child loves a book, it will not last long until it learns almost outside.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When the service for children's care for their holiday days asked the Prime Minister about his favorite children's book, he chose the book Dr. Seussin The Lorax, a 1971 environmental-protection story.
The choice was difficult, Cameron wrote in a message published on the website of the SuperCamps company and continued: “A fun, mobile, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children because it always feels like a picture or message we have not seen before.
All of this is true, but the next chapter, where Cameron is supposed to describe the book’s story, is a summary of the 2012 film version, where a rather short original text was added to the new characters and details.
“In the city of Tarville, where all nature has been lost and even the air is a commodity, Ted hopes he can overcome his dreams of a girl’s heart by filling Audrey’s desire to see the right tree, the text says and describes the love story that Dr. Seuss died in 1991, not written by Theodor Seuss Geisel.
If this is not yet suspicious enough, Cameron's text sounds like it was taken from the Lorax movie on the Internet Movie Database website, which begins as follows: \"In the city of Tarville, where everything is artificial and even the air is commercial, Ted hopes he can win his dreams on Audrey's girl's heart.
Taking into account that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be such an unexplored book plot. In it a young, anonymous boy hears how local nature has destroyed the greedy, wood beating and accessories of the tissuey Kerskanen, without caring for the story of the short, fig-like creature Lorax, which says on behalf of trees.
Such a relatively unseen PR task is probably out of the assistant, which apparently has never read the book 20 times in a row for a child.
The Prime Minister said the text must have come from Cameron's election office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment more at the moment.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being left behind by the English team, but it was still a hard place.
Playing against Pakistan in the Arab Emirates is a hard task, but when you see what a team England has chosen for the tour, I don’t think that the last 3-0 serial destruction is likely to occur.
I wouldn't close the guest win out of the bill.
Alastair Cook's side can be less experienced than a three-year-old team, but it involves good spinners and team thinking is strong: they don't have scars in 2012, only young positiveness.
Moeen Ali develops in his spiral feeds and Adil Rashid is an attacker option, although it is an unknown factor at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from the English Cricket team, he replaced Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth's team is obviously difficult to analyze to me because I'm his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against attackers in challenging circumstances, and the simple but bitter truth is that Cricket players are appreciated based on their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root’s choice before the release, because, as I have said before, players are the best choice factors.
About 100 points more, and Lyth's season in the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own destiny.
I hope if he gets more runs for Yorkshire, another chance comes in.
England’s head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth’s attitude even when he did not perform as well as he could, and it doesn’t surprise me. Lyth is, above all, a team player.
It's hard to answer the question of how long the hitter gets to leave a mark.
Lyth was chosen seven times for the country team, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was chosen nine times.
Only Compton had the opportunity to play at home and in the guests.
The only point of appeal is that English chose Jonathan Trott first to the Caribbean when Lyth was in top shape, but that lost opportunity is now the past.
Alex Hales comes with me, and there's a hitter I appreciate.
He has something we saw in Yorkshire early this season when he made 236 points against us on the Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as others before him, but this, of course, depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
There's been a balled idea of Moen in a shot at Cook, where an extra feeder would be placed in the field, but maybe four fast ones would be held, and I'm not against it.
I don't understand why no hitter could hit there, and this left-hand man has already shown himself to be quite a Cricket player.
Moeen may not have done his job in the province of Worcestershire, but he is a third for them, and there is little difference in it.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games in the first slow before moving to the opening in 2001.
He immediately made three hundred points and did not remember the past.
Zafar Ansari becomes a team thief, and, little of what I've done with him, he feels very impressive from a young man.
People can look at his unblemished statistics - hitting the average of 31, with a ball of 35 - and think that it is a gambling game, but there are no too many feeders and the electors chose the young.
He learns a lot with this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few hard additions to the coach side.
The appointment of the Sri Lankan Hitter Mchain Jayawarden as a consultant in the games can prove to be a genius.
He is one of the most comfortable guys in the game and brings a huge amount of experience because he has done everything in all the situations and against all sorts of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes along with the white ball games, bringing both energy and an unscrupulous whimble.
I have always thought that he was born to be involved in international crises, whether it was playing or coaching, and he has the same sort of exploitative intelligence as Mahella.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is rested on a day-to-day basis, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with this.
Although not everyone agrees, trainers and elect not to schedule.
And you have to remember that just like the players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions will never be made on a light basis.
Britain's exit from the EU (Brexit) can take a profit if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron's semi-violent renegotiation strategies to keep Britain in the EU will face increasing problems from day to day, even if it does not even take into account the heart of Jeremy, whether it is true or not, Corbyn's choice to lead the Labour Party or the anger of the trade union's central organisation to Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
The European diplomatic officer recently explained that, since the EU is in so deep a range of crises, all of which are not its own cause, some Member States are tired of a British self-centered agenda full of concessions and disruptive contractual changes that these countries do not want in most respects.
At their annual meeting in Brighton, the Centre for Trade Unions decided that it would not want them if they were to destroy social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's self-evident agent.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, taking a picture of themselves in front of the famous local monument, either with or without a local eye, and then coming home, saying that they will win supporters for reforms.
Everything's about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outside the UK inside the EU TV – “Don’t leave us alone with France,” says Berlin, suggests that the short-sighted ministers and officials of certain capital cities are now at a point where they don’t care if we’re going to leave.
German cautious and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but he has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave his work before it goes to ruin in the same way that it was too long for Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France François Holland has a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's also a fading force.
Poland can soon have a national right-wing government, Spain is left-wing.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrifice for selfieberts, as their energy would rather be directed to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want it because of their own separatist trends.
So, my friend presents, some of these ministers can even plan consciously to make useless comments about the Scottish National Party style during the 2017 referendum to speed up the Brexit process.
\"The renegotiation of the negotiations had been organised - and the re-negotiation of the negotiations had no significance for the UK -
Europeans have had a rough experience of how to be part of the newspaper of Fleet Street and how the EU-Sceptics alone in the press are, what they were not at the time of Tony Benn’s referendum in 1975, when our members of the 1973 group were confirmed in the ratio of 2:1.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the largest Euro-opportunist who made a name for themselves by writing “the direct bananas of the EU” when he was correspondenced with Brussels in the early 1990s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a number of tax-loving winemakers, telephone-cracking foreigners, as well as people with their registered office elsewhere, who own most of our big newspapers.
Tony Blair, in fact, thought the same about them, but realized that if you were in a cage with a passionate gorilla, bananas must be abandoned because of the confusion if you don't want to be on that gorilla's lunch list and later dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more blarish than Blair himself, as regards the fight against Cameron's renegotiation, in other words, the principle behind the EU's rejected constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, giving Blair the status of exit.
The press never forgiven him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who kindly killed me in the Westminster House on Monday (I told him that he no longer has time to waste me), seems to be in danger of re-introducing Neil Kinnock's 80th-century boycotting the Murdoch strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
Although it can take time, however, he has to develop a coherent strategy to keep in touch with the media. Not to me, but undoubtedly Andrew Marri, whose BBC-shool Corby left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, beautifully said, evolving.
He said he would like us to stay in the renewed EU.
Well, most of the people outside the Ukip War Painting and the most Conservative Party nationalists can certainly stand behind this opinion.
Hilary-Benn, but not Benn-fani-Benn said this to both radio and TV this week, when his inner patrol would have wanted to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint Karski John McDonnell as a shadow government minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his father-in-law was on TV trying to be unfair to his Labour Party government colleagues without going so far that he would lose his seat.
Hilary's coatings were more attractive.
But the battle for staying involved in any situation - the Benn's statement - was not what McDonnell said, and not all that Corbyn told the chiefs and the MPs at a private meeting on Monday night.
What is the unhierarchic, emotional and personal image that Corbyn wants to convey (remember that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the era of the 24-hour TV, and especially in the circles of social media, which is an appropriate growth platform for persecution and fraud.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to support the Labour Party in the referendum itself.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnel and Corbyn's basic tour of EU membership (and therefore in line with their Benn-minded regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult debate with left-wing thinkers whose narcissism of small differences is central to dogmi's opils.
With regard to his duality with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby is not campaigning to give up), foreign diplomats just need to try to explain it to their supervisors.
Why would Paris or Berlin be in favour of wasting political capital (even those who have suspicious voters) in their concessions to the UK when it can be completely unnecessary?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed with the weak military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in the power of the Conservative Government cutting costs, as I was reminded on Monday at the initiative of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticized Public Health England's electric tobacco assessment
Researchers have said that the state-funded agency’s claim that electricity tobacco is 95% less harmful than conventional was the beginning of a meeting of 12 people with links to the tobacco industry.
The experts who wrote the British Medical Journal (BMJ) agreed to Lance with the evidence used by the Public Health England (PHE) in their report on electric tobacco.
PHE published this report last month, describing it as an overview of the evidence.
However, many researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data and referred to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
In the last month, the medical journal Lancet published a letter that attacked the base of the PHE’s main decision-exceptive hutera.
Two other BMJ-written researchers have considered whether the claims were built on a rock or sand.
The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine at the European School of Public Health Martin McKee and Professor Simon Capewell of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool say: “The main principle of public health is that the methods of action must be based on proven effectiveness.
They say that the public expects that PHE’s best estimate is that electricity cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional tobacco, based on detailed assessment and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from one meeting of 12 people, which developed a multi-criminal analysis model (MCDA) to synthesis their opinion on the disadvantages associated with various nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarised in the study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was EuroSwiss Health, a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO has previously received funding from Bristish American Tobacco for independent research.
He also supported BAT’s public health powers in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced that they had received funding from the electric tobacco manufacturer, but not the funding he said had previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The selection criteria for panel members are not mentioned, but the panel includes a number of well-known electricity tobacco supporters, some of which also show that they have received funding in the field of the study.
Others have not been known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE’s tobacco director.
The study produced by the group, in many words, recognises that there is a lack of evidence concerning the disadvantages of most products, and most of the criteria, McKee and Capewell, are written.
However, none of these links or restrictions is mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE’s claims that “There is no evidence that the electric tobacco is on the road to smoking in children or non-smokers” are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of PHE’s health and well-being, said that the claims made at BMJ were previously answered.
He says: “The fires are much less harmful than burning.
Half of those who burn their lives die of dependence.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks caused by electricity tobacco are relatively low, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there is so much public awareness of the relative risks compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80 000 people die of smoking-related disease each year, and smoking costs NHS $2 billion a year.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, even though the electrical cigarettes are not risk-free, their disadvantages are only a fraction of traditional tobacco disadvantages - we are fulfilling our national responsibility.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 Director
Former Channel 4 president Luke Johnson has said that BBC should stop sending programs such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would give anything – such as this soap series on Albert Square.
Johnson said that permit payments should only be used to make programs that other British broadcasters do not do.
He criticizes the BBC for putting public-service programs that are likely to have fewer audiences in difficult broadcasting periods against the most prominent programs of competitors and channels like BBC4.
After Tony Hall, CEO of the BBC, said that the company wanted to work more with other organisations, Johnson said he was able to establish a relationship with the BBC for six years at the time.
“I don’t understand the idea that BBC will produce and send programs that would clearly suit non-subsidy competitors,” Johnson said to the Committee on Communications in the upper room as part of its research on the future of BBC.
If the license fee is kept - and I'm not sure it would be a good idea for this media or for the long term - it should at least limit its production to programs that others do not do and that.
The Voice is sent to the most important mission time, because it is wanted to collect as much support as possible for its future.
The idea of no one else showing the program is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's obviously nonsense.
Johnson said: “I don’t understand why the regressive tax should be financed by programmes that could also be financed without state aid.
The Voice is one of those and EastEnders is another, without denying within the house.
Directly, other channels would give anything about it.
I don't understand how it's about sending a public service.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC at all.
Channel 4 in 2004-2010, a serial entrepreneur, Johnson, said that BBC is responsible for hunting audiences, and that they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support.
He made his comment on the most popular series of BBC, reminding Tony Ball, former director of Sky. He used his 2003 MacTaggard lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that BBC sells such series as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC’s smaller public service programs are going to BBC4 where we can often not measure the number of viewers, but BBC thus meets its responsibilities and can then, in defense of 4 billion pounds of permit payments, point out that we are doing all these unknown programs that no one looks at.
They put them in a place where no one will ever see them.
Johnson said to the committee, “I’m going to make you look for a more regressive system for who gets the most value from it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that 150 pounds per year will get a lot of value, but I don’t know if it’s true for people with $150 in money because they don’t use BBC much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who also testified to the Committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should reassess it for the time-to-day mission of Reith to inform, train and entertain it.
He said that only a small proportion of BBC production is now classified as training - he said the figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio radio - and that it should be taken as a model from Australian and Canadian radios and changed the role of data communication, coaching and entertaining -
With regard to partnership issues, Elstein said that BBC should focus more on events such as the Proms concerts, which, he said, are shown on television only a few, and join with commercial companies so that all of these can be viewed online.
– Audiogenetics – enables brain cell management through audio waves
The video shows how the shuttle pads change direction as soon as the sound pulse hits them.
Researchers have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems to control them with sound wave discharges.
The tiny socks change direction as soon as they hit a sound pulse that is too high to hear the human ear.
Impulses work by switching on genetically modified motion nerve cells with ultrasonic-responsible film channels.
Related: Scientists read and write brain activity with light
Researchers said that worms indicate the functionality of a new method called sound genetics. In it ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Researcher of the Salk Institute in California, La Jolla, Sreekant Chalasani, told The Guardian that the method could one day replace deep brain surgery. It is an invasive measure in which people’s brains are subjected to electrical impulses to the treatment of Parkinson’s disease.
Succolamas do not normally react to ultrasound, but Chalasani discovered that when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic small bubbles, the situation changed.
He found that the bubbles confirmed ultrasonic waves that then went inside the worms.
The reinforced ultrasonic waves affect the TRP-4 ion sinks, structures in some worm membranes.
The sound waves make these ion channels open and activate the cells attached to them, according to a report published in Nature Communications.
To produce ultrasonic-controlled shuttles, Chalasani genetically modified worms so that in some of their business nerve cells are TRP-4-ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasonic to modified worms, microscopics confirmed the sound waves and transmitted them to the worms where they connect the modified motion nerve cells.
There are some of the same features in the process as in optogenics, a pioneering tool that gives scientists the opportunity to switch the nerve cells on and off using light pulses.
However, my Chalasi says that sonogenetics can have some benefits compared to optogenics.
Unlike the light that needs to be sent from the optical fiber along the desired point within the brain, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass through the tissue in an accessible way, so they can be sent to the brain from the skull.
“We believe that using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it may be possible to obtain the target human nerve cells to respond to the ultrasound signal in certain neurological treatments in a clinical environment,” Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

As a result of a special campaign, many posters appeared on bus stops and subways requiring more accurate access.
“Excellent information, Traveling on DLR route 15-18 September – one is asked using the London underground font and brand, when the DLR track becomes a picture of the tank.
In September, the pack of arms traders arrive on the DLR route... the customers are asked to help stop the weapons fair.
These 300 posters are made by artists who were present at the Banksy Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs (the Museum of Public Planning).
The collection called Special Patrol Group helped to distribute posters around London using the \"Ad Space Hack Packs\" packages. This is a six-pound package of six-pound kits, which, according to the collective, allows you to access a third of the advertising space of the entire planet's bus stops.
Transport for London is not interested in this unauthorised-published conspiracy.
A special Patrol Group collection of parody ads.
According to the Cruel Designs curator and the University of Essex magazine, the artists are increasingly questioning and wanting to take political work to outside the galleries.
Many artists have started working with activists on resistance fronts when they have realized that they have to go to the outside world if they want their art to affect society.
The second anti-armed poster greets working travelers in the subway.
Amnesty’s video has been viewed through Facebook over 100,000 times in the last 24 hours. It was created free of charge by the advertising agency VCCP, and also by graphic designer and background browsers working for free.
Matt Lever, the creative director of VCCP, found that the gun fairs were not advertised at all, and in the ExCeL calendar there was an empty point, and he thought, \"Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid.\"
They played with the idea of a more realistic advertising of cloud-like corporation, but it was more important to focus on it with bright colors and animation.
“They have done fantastic work to help us raise questions about the illegal torture equipment to be sold at the fair,” says Amnesty’s Tom Davies.
Now the UK government needs to take action and make sure that the means of torture are not illegally sold near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art of the art of the art of the art of the art exhibition comes from the inside of ExCeL when the actors shop fantasticly decorated products.

8 Golden Rules for Living in the Student Home
It’s been 11 years since I moved to the student home when I was not aware of the fact that I still believed in baret and moral relativism, but only now I remember the many smiles of the people I’ve been irritable, and many, long complaints I remember.
Most of my studies can be summed up to eight simple rules.
Moving to the apartment can be completely scary for any nerves.
It's tempting to blow: tell me where you are from, whether you like the middle year, and where you think about Corbyn, and why I really don't love or hate Marmite because it's just a little bit of a whirlwind to find me in my room.
Take a breath.
And also help others take a breath - ask questions and show interest.
It will guide the conversation and help you find the people you like, and not those you don’t want to talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and they would share evaporators.
Give people space.
People’s rooms are often turned into cocktails, movies’ seals and over-the-counters, but they are also places where people dress and repair their underwear.
Related: Don’t even imagine starting a university when you’re in a relationship
The university is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many apartments form a culture of walking from one room to another, which is friendly, social and causes lifelong friends.
It could mean hell for someone who's trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture will allow you to say “I care about you and I want to be a friend with you, but you have to leave now that I can recover the energy I spent talking to you about...
Try to sense when a student friend is tired of socialization, and maybe send a text message to the door instead of knocking.
When you came up with a speech, knock.
A guy in my student apartment thought that if the door wasn’t locked, he was invited in.
He saw some pretty things.
Befriend yourself through baking.
Since you're starting the university at the top of the bakery, knocking on people's doors with a chocolate baking board and presenting yourself seems somewhat less strange, less welcome to the neighborhood, I was resting something for you, now smile when I ask you personal questions from the 50s.
Providing self-made treats is a great way to make friends.
Your partners may feel obliged to talk and may be in the future to combine your face with a tasty surprise.
This depends on how you can cook.
Poorly mixed flour sugar-fats are likely to make people just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
Obviously, stealing someone's chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a tip of milk on your tea?
Ask and check on the milk owner.
It's possible that they'll give you permission, even though they're boiling internally.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you get my sympathies, but try to take it more adult than my housemate, who mixed it with laundry to punish those who stole it.
He's in prison now.
You shouldn't be making noise so that people can't sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that proverb's pata in a cataract.
The girl in my hall asked her neighbor if they could play her drum and bass music later because it was three in the morning and she had a exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally silenced at five in the morning, the girl kindly allowed them to sleep for two hours before putting their own music to a blow, locked their doors and went to a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband moved to the same apartment with you?
Or reversely, wouldn’t it be incredibly embarrassing if you considered a roommate to be your future spouse, beat yourself together, divorce you, and then see him every day, and possibly lose all of your friends together to him.
Of course, the heart wants what you want, but if a hot apartment partner is not really your future spouse, you could even try to talk sense to your lower head.
In the exhilarating moment, when you find that someone has left their keys in their locked room, the border between fucking and bullying is thinner than it affects.
A good sticker is fun, but it can be cancelled in a moment.
You can give useful and fun teaching safety by hiding something, but never mess up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys into the glass of water, which you then put on the freezer, but don't attach their property on the blue bar as high as twice.
Racist impact on the residence of foreign students in Kite - The house planned as reception centre was crushed in Salo
A racist attack on Kite in northern Karelia was made on Saturday morning.
Unlike the police said earlier, it is not the premises of minor asylum seekers, but the sleeping rooms of foreign students who have been in Finland for a longer time, says the teacher Heidi Lukkainen of the Kiteen Evangelical People’s University.
The windows and walls of the apartments of the National University were crushed with racist marks, such as carving, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one accommodation, says the police in Eastern Finland.
According to Luke, as the responsible teacher of the youth’s social guarantee training, there were approximately ten people in the building that was targeted by the outrage.
“While the weekend and adult people are free to move, some might have been elsewhere,” Luke says.
There are 12 people from 12 different nationalities in the National University.
They are already students who have been in Finland for some time and newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
All those in the battle building have a status.
Some study in adult education, some are in vocational studies and some study in Finland,\" Luke says.
A status is a so-called permanent residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
The Eastern Finnish police investigates the attack as a damage and a violation of home peace.
According to Luke, the students were held a press conference on Monday, with the necessary interpretations.
There's no panic around here, and no one wants to leave.
We've had more than a decade of foreign students, and this is the first time something like this happens,\" Luke says.
Luke said the mess was already cleaned out of the walls.
As a contractor, there were at least three men, and they had been on the move with a light passenger car.
I think this is the main highlight of the young weekend when this topic has been on the surface.
Nothing more serious, Luke says.
Salo also has a hospital in which a reception centre has been designed.
The incident happened last week.
It was announced on the MTV website on Tuesday night.
The hospital wall was painted as a hakarist and written in English, “You are not welcome.”
It's been reported to the police.
Amendment 15.9. at 16.02 The incorrect information provided by the police on the age and status of the persons living in the building.
The state will end the Y train to Karjaa - passengers in their chewing gums,
The Y train from Helsinki to Raasepor will cease to run in March.
The news alarmed passengers on the main train station in Helsinki that started the train at the beginning of the evening.
In particular, the slope strikes the Siuntiolas, said Torbjörn Bengtström, a municipality resident in the municipality.
It's idiotic, because the number of residents is growing all the time and the working hours need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be up to anything but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says the HSTV interview video will be coming to the capital of the tractor.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in the Uusimaa.
The H and R trains on the main track are combined into a new R line.
Purola's position in Järvenpää and Nupplinna in Tuusula are not used.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published on Tuesday information on what route the Ministry of Transport purchased during the next contractual period.
The contract period varies from year to year and the end of routes is in the whole country.
The new four-year agreement to be concluded in autumn will be approved by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Siuntiolainen Bengtström believes that the state train stoper is a short-sighted operation.
We make the same mistakes that have been made before and repeated in a very systematic way.
Then there will be repentance.
The Y train is also used by non-raaseporians and Zionists, because it is fast and bypasss several stations.
On the train, the Espoon Annina Pöyry was plagued by the fate of the travelers from the city area.
“It’s especially bad for those who have to redesign their journey,” he said when he was on the Y train.
A little relief is promised.
A new train connection will probably be coming to the beach, which will replace the Y train in the area of the Helsinki Region (HSL), i.e. to the Churchnumme.
This will increase the costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for the municipalities and their taxpayers.
“We’re starting to find out different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices,” said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to accurately estimate the costs.
Rihtniemi says that, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid for the Y-train in about a million years, the Ministry has paid a lot more than that.
The R line on the main track skips two positions.
On the other hand, the number of trains in Ainola and Saunakallio doubles.
The whole country ceases to have 28 small positions and numerous routes.
The Ministry will no longer buy train traffic from Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keurou and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinajoki.
The Piesämäki Route is shortened to the Piesämäki Route.
Trains are reduced by Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
Over half a million trips per year are made on permanent routes, with a total of around 9 million travels being purchased by the Ministry.
The new agreement is intended to bring 12.3 million annual savings to the state.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27,5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the book on the state of the capital: \"It is worth studying in Marx.\"
The crises in the world economy have raised the surface of Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his final work published in 1867-1894 on the capital of the capital, writing in the book of the capital of Marx, published today by Yrjö Hakanen as the former president of GDP.
\"He will now be taken more seriously than in a long time,\" Hakanen wrote in his speech.
Marx's estimates of capitalist economic development, internationalisation and intrusion in all areas of life, concentration of capital and the growing role of capital and imaginative capital have proved to be amazingly distant.
The list of books based on the Capital Seminars organized by Hakasen is also published by Professor of Aalto University, a respected economist, Sixten Korkman.
In the book, Korkman writes Marx's being current and eternal.
However, it is not Marxian, the former CEO of the Institute for Economic Studies and the Organisation for Economic Development, is it?
Not at all.
On the phone, Korkman says that he does not consider Marx as a current economic thinker, but rather as an interesting social theory.
Today, social sciences are distinguished and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and a class of literature.
“The common idea is that the athetic history tells us about the false opinions of the dead men,” Korkman begins.
The truth is, Marx's predictions went badly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew conclusions from the beginning of capitalism too far, Korkman thinks.
But Korkman sees the value of Marx’s radical attitude.
“The most relevant question in Marx is that he asked good questions,” he says.
We are talking about Marx’s interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
“Marx may give inspiration to someone who wants to understand a big picture, as a result of the changing world as a result of the technical bubble,” Korkma’s analysis.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is not helping Marx.
In his opinion, capitalism was a hopeless case that should only be stopped.
However, in Marx, Korkman thinks he should be familiar.
“In the 1970s Marx could not be read,” Korkman said.
“The Mao and the Trotskys and the other sects hated all capitalism, but even more each other.”
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also approach without the ideological and political weight of the years back.
“Every social scientist should get to know Marx’s world of thought, like other classes,” Korkman said.
The UN calls on war criminals to be convicted in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for a special court to investigate war crimes in the Sri Lanka Civil War, AFP says.
The UN report on the Civil War in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both Sri Lanka's armed forces and the rebels known as Tamil soldiers.
The Sri Lanka Civil War estimates that at least 100,000 people died.
There is no accurate information on the number of victims.
In particular, in the last months of the long war, the major attack of the armed forces should be properly investigated, the UN report calls for.
Sri Lanka's armed forces are accused of torture, kidnapping, and systematic sexual violence, as likely as men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have committed the forced use of bystanders and children as fighters.
Both sides have been murdered according to the report.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intends to organise the investigation itself, but it is not going to allow the establishment of the UN Court of Justice, as foreign judges.
England’s Yo-Test allowed to weigh social media
In the autumn student books, there was a long foreign language that most of them had English on Wednesday.
He tested his English skills from over 16,000 experiments.
In the experiment, it could be written about social media.
Based on its own experience, it was necessary to consider whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the English text of 150-250 could show the web page to the advisor.
The title was Dear Agony.
Agony Aunt is responsible for the Finnish Lithuanian resting chair.
He had to ask how parents should look at things from the point of view of young people.
There were four subjects that had to be chosen.
“It was the hardest of them, the third subject of the Swedish-language high school in Porvoo, is by Mia Lybeck.
The third issue was just a sitat from the former President of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth subject, according to Lybeck, was very nice.
He had to write a fire speech about why businesses should hire young people to work.
“At least in our school, we have been trained to write speeches,” Lybeck says and estimates the entire experiment as normal.
In Finnish - or Swedish - an English experiment, questions were answered about texts that, for example, included the adaptation of the summer campus to climate change and the processing of large amounts of information.
On Wednesday, some long Russians were also written (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).
The articles of the autumn will continue on Friday, when the test of another domestic, Swedish or Finnish.
In the readings, the test is normally carried out, i.e. the expression of the salary earners does not affect it.
The College Board calls on the pilots to search for suitable transport connections in time so that they can get to the trial.
You can also get more time if you can prove that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
In Oulu, a deal was robbed with a gun.
On Wednesday morning, the store was robbed in the city of Kello.
According to the police, the robbers were dressed in dark clothes and the faces were covered with a commandoscope.
The man is normal and about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money.
They're investigating this as a gross robbery.
Police are preparing to join tens of thousands of protesters in Helsinki - support parties from elsewhere in Finland
The government’s anti-circumciating expression of mind will be blocked by the Helsinki Centre on Friday, predicting the police.
According to preliminary data, even tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, A Plan and STKC associations meet at Rautatientor at 11 a.m.
The police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
The police at work are not only responsible for alarming tasks and other police activities, but also for ensuring the smooth operation of a giant expression.
Roads leading to the railway station are closed from motor vehicles for about 9.30-14.
Only alarm vehicles are allowed in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi traffic is cut off from the district of Kaisaniemi, from the west to Mannerheiming.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
So far, it seems to be enough.
I'm not taking a stand for police struggles.
According to Kujala, the support parties from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki because of the demonstration of mind.
The police won't tell you the exact numbers of patrols.
“Some of them are coming, but we’re basically going to be fine with our own,” Kujalala says.
The police are calling for private cars to be avoided in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic hub extends from Hakaniemi level to its core centre.
Standing traffic is expected from morning to early evening.
With protesters arriving from other parts of Finland, there are also a lot of order buses coming to Helsinki.
They won't be released to the Railway Station.
Buses are, in principle, distant.
The rest of the journey should then walk to the demonstration,\" Kujala says.
The demonstration also stops Helsinki’s public transport.
From a police point of view, this is a positive side.
The question of the smoothness of public transport, which is normally at the hands of these large crowds, is now taking care of itself.
The organisers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of government opponents of economic policy may be in Helsinki.
The police are waiting for the protest to go smoothly.
People are ordinary workers or unemployed – ordinary citizens.
The Finnishs are reasonable and peaceful, says Kujala.
On Friday, local protests are also held in different parts of Finland.
Friday’s expression of mind is exceptional in many ways – do you remember these strikes and expressions of mind?
The great expression of the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is not a very good point of comparison with Finnish political history, says Martti Siisiinen, Professor of Sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It's no wonder the Ay movement protests.
If it didn't, it would raise your hands in front of the government, Siseiinen says.
The very right-wing government has hit the core points of the Finnish corporate tradition - and also the points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard choices are missing the right to contract.
Here are a lot of features that the Ay movement is actually trying to get to its knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement has a place to look in the mirror.
For example, mirrors are needed because the Ay movement does not have the support of all payers for the demonstrations of Friday.
The new one is now the sharp division that the expression of the mind will bring about among the ones that the Ay movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
Unemployed people from different parts of Finland expressed their views at the Parliamentary House in November 1993.
If you're looking for a point of comparison for Friday's demonstration, it could be a huge demonstration of the unemployed, the Murrostorstai, held in 1993, says Siisiinen.
In the midst of the deepest recession, the Murrostorstai gathered 20,000 unemployed.
Esko Ahon (centred) government is complicating from the labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relationship between the Finnish government and the employees’ organisations had never been as bad as during the Ahon bourgeois government.
Now, between the government and the Ay movement may be even worse than in the days of Murrostorsta.
In addition, it is now the very bourgeois government of Finland, Siisiinen says.
The current government coalition is still interesting in this way that it is so tightly right despite the words of the basic Finnishs.
At the time of the steep, there were certain elements of the old labour movement.
Several thousand protesters are expected on Friday.
The expression also stops public transport and possibly closes day-care centres and schools.
Although the expression of mind does not receive the indivisible support of the payees, it can become the largest in years.
Around 300 protests have been held in Helsinki every year in recent years.
They're on the edge.
Traditionally, in Finnish ay movement demonstrations, it has been quite peaceful - although the methods of action have been tightened in recent years.
Traditionally, Finnish protests avoid conflict, they are law-minded.
The protestors are trying to avoid damage to or destruction of property, Sisian says.
The late 1990s, however, brought new winds.
The culture of demonstration changed.
EU membership irritates farmers to throw eggs and the police prepared to get a pig shit on.
The firemen strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also spectacular strikes, among other things, pilots and pilots.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electric ceilings of the 1970s
The most significant strikes in the 1970s were the metal ceiling in 1971 and the power and power ceiling in 1977.
The metal man strike was attended by 70,000 metal men.
The strike was suspended after seven weeks of the strike.
Metalmen received a 16% increase in wages.
In the spring of 1977, the electric ceiling lasted 49 days and caused electric shocks all over the country.
Murrostorist in 1993
On 4 November 1993, about 20,000 people met with the Parliamentary House, many of them who were unemployed, and expressed their views on the job.
Firemen striked for three months in 1998.
The firemen strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, unless the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were forced into egg harvest in the protest of farmers against the EU in 1994.
“Siberia teaches, the EU ends, was one of the slogans.
Spain's farmers had a ton of snow.
The Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 also made farmers protest and burn hayballs in front of the meeting.
Nurses striked in 1983 and 1995
Nurses were striked for about a month in 1995.
Last time they were in the strike in 1983.
In 1995, a few deaths occurred during the strike.
The factory threatened with the strike and mass transplants of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass migration was ultimately the result of negotiations.
Doctors were licking in 2001.
“The doctors in the strike - for the escape - included the slogan of the lawmakers in 2001.
The local health centre and hospital physicians’ strike lasted five months and had a lively debate on how the strikes could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised doctors' salaries.
Students moving in 2013
About 5,000 students march for study support in Helsinki from the Senate Square to the Parliamentary House in 2013.
Central Crime Police to find out the backgrounds of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police
The Austrian police have requested assistance from the Central Crime Police to investigate the backgrounds of the refugee stock registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped in Aisterheim near the German border with 42 refugees.
There is no information on whether the truck might have been on its way to Finland.
They were all in good condition.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
Research and main responsibility are at the event in Austria, says Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of Central Crime Police.
At the end of the film, other refugees travelling by truck in Austria were more likely.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board died apparently by suffocating.
According to the General Radio, which first reported with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to the Finnish company.
The company is engaged in, among other things, restaurant activities and its CEO is a foreign-like, about 40-year-old man.
Two Iraqis have been arrested for human trafficking in Austria.
The refugee's far-reaching captain, the former drug crimer, and the uplifting businessman - the story of the five smugglers
Upporous smuggler king, violent boat driver, a stylish missionary, and a taxi driver holding himself as a good guy.
For example, such people are engaged in human trafficking in the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci at the University of Trenbolone have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their customers, and their book Death Travel Agency will appear in Finland this week.
In the book, they present the lonkers of human smuggling, present the proposals for solutions, and present smugglers from different stages of the business.
The HS presents five of them.
I'm gonna get rid of them right now.
The Kerkenna Islands on the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians are heading there for the summer trip.
For its location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as there are only 120 kilometres to the island of Lampedusa, which belongs to Italy.
Because of comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives in Emir, the captain in the chain and the father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their cataracts, but the fisherman is more profitable to carry people.
This was done by Emir on a blue, ten-metre tree, hundreds of times.
If the boat closes, there will be 40 people.
From one trip to Emir earns about 8,000 euros after the cost.
Emir has five assistants looking for her customers all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until again in the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Island in small groups.
Emir places them in empty houses for as long as he sees good.
Food is given to customers just and just stay alive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the client is out of money, it’s their problem.
We're going to leave the water at midnight.
The first night we drive out of the island, then stop, wait for the day and drive to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in the 20-meter high waves, passengers cry and vomit.
At the end of the day, the human cargo has been dismantled in half an hour and Emir leaves for a return trip.
Emir wants to be afraid.
That's why he's beating his customers, and at least claiming he's beating up the hangers from the dead.
In the book, he says that once the police hit him, he threw all his passengers over the side and told them to swim to the nearest island.
“I looked at the customers one by one, and I threw them over the side,” says Emir in the book.
The most peaceful travelers come from the south of Sahara.
I'm told he's got to abuse this.
I'm gonna get rid of them right now.
We need to show them who's in charge right now.
Just a regular taxi driver
Goran is a regular taxi driver in Bogojisha, Serbia.
His taxi's not very good - the starter's engine is pulling last, and it's seen its best days anyway.
However, the most important thing for Goran’s customers is that the taxi is moving above all, and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogojisha is a small village of 500 inhabitants, about 60 kilometers from Belgrade to lunch.
Next to the village, the centre for asylum seekers is located, where most families are allowed.
In the forests around the centre, men travelling without their family are accommodated in tents, warehouses and abandoned cars, which everyone has now managed to find or build.
Families living in the forest who have not submitted asylum applications to Serbia for a reason or for another reason.
Some also live in private homes, but it is a public secret.
From a group of foresters, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted – through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of cross-border crossings and weeks of walking in a difficult terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
In the end, when arriving in the area of Bogojisha, a major human smuggling hub, people are dying.
Goran's Cyticians are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
\"They say their thing once and that's enough,\" Goran said.
According to him, the Africans are trying to do a trick.
Goran doesn't like it.
What a silly nonsense all the way.
First, the price is EUR 300, then they count it to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and good-hearted man.
Money doesn't interest me.
I'm just doing my job and helping people, he says in the book.
Goran says he works at a lower rate than others and billing his rides to the Hungarian border for only 50 euros from a person.
The trip is a quarter of a mile away, most of which are comfortable highways.
I hear colleagues ask for three or four times the price.
Goran deserves about 50,000 euros a year.
It's not a big deal for smugglers, but it's a very nice annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not carry migrants within 12 kilometers of the Hungarian border.
Goran does not care about it: he knows the roads and the shortcuts and takes his rides to the end of a mile away.
Then he shows his customers the right direction and cheers away.
In the Work of Grace
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called a missionary and is not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant church in the capital of Uganda in Kambala, where there are many refugees from the Congo, as well as a small center to help the Congolese refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Embassy runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing the work of mercy.
It's important for the embassy to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and takes care that the white calf of the rubber strips will decorate elegantly under the low waist of the jeans.
The embassy is proud of its new Mercedes, its terrain car and three motorcycles.
When the Messenger does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and forwards to Europe.
At first, the customer calls some of the five phone numbers of the Transmitter.
He advises that it is worth arriving at the border in the morning, hiding the money with a whistling and whispering among the merchants crossing the border.
In order to obtain asylum seekers or refugee status to the Ugandan authorities, it must be said that it is home to, for example, the North Kivu war areas, and that violence has been forced to flee from their home.
Often it is true, but if not, the Embassy will arrange a new identity for the customer.
The old identity card will be destroyed and another will be obtained.
This will help the Embassy's contacts with the Ugandan police.
The customer will then be redirected to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: asylum search procedure, civil society organisations, in the end the United Nations Refugee Organization (UNHCR).
The embassies know bureaucracy because they themselves have become a refugee in Uganda.
He will charge each port separately: the submission of an application to the Ugandan police will cost about EUR 100, the handling of documents to the humanitarian organisation, and the migration process, for example, to some European countries, EUR 4,500-7,000.
Foliot and ice creams
Tom's a beginner smuggler, a former drug dealer.
The four-year Irish is on the French coast of Calais, where his work is to put people on the road to Britain.
He has an Afghan, French taxi driver, and dozens of truckers living in London who don’t even know he’s in a human secret transport business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver pick up their customers, usually 2-3 people, somewhere near the center of Calais.
They drive the A26 highway and try to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would be forced directly to prison for illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been sitting for seven years because of drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom and his customers running over the highway to a resting place where the drivers sleep before continuing to cross the canal to Britain.
Tom chooses a suitable truck - to make sure it's on his way to England, not even to the Netherlands, and cut the line between the safety vibe of the protective cover.
It needs to be done quietly so that the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved in the plot, but then the wheel is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wrapped his client in a aluminium foil, the same thing that is wrapped in the kitchen around a pastry or oven potato.
It should prevent the police heat scanner from noticeing the hideaway.
Some use the same purpose as ice-filled sleeping bags.
Tom leaves his client's truck, and he's out of town hoping that you wouldn't be driving a shady driver at least before the UK.
King of smugglers
Muammer Küçuk is one of the world's most famous human smugglers.
Upporish Turks have been called the Master of Marketing and the Undisputed King of Illegal Lands in the Mediterranean, which governs sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Since the 1990s, Küçük has been working and has been constantly developing new ways of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only needs the money.
One of the new methods is luxury fishing: Turkish ports are rented to take American or European families for a few days to travel.
In reality, ships are loaded to the precision of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurdishs and Afghans, which are transported from Istanbul to one of the ports and from there to a sea of Europe against a fee of between EUR 5 000 and 7 000.
Customers are kept in human warehouses, for example in old industrial halls until they leave.
People get into minibuses and drive somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among vegetation and wait for a sign.
When given, you need to get on board quickly.
Passengers must keep the entire journey under the deck hidden.
The Navy can only observe how deep the ship swims, for no other signs of the human population are visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers get out and vomit, the better.
Küçük receives about EUR 53,000 from one luxury trip after the cost.
He does not take care of practical things himself but hires the captains, recruiters, guards, hosts and other smaller factors to handle the work for himself.
During the summer season, transport is held for at least hundreds of years and Küçuk earns millions.
He is believed to have bought land, pharmaceutical company and over a hundred apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçuk was arrested in 2011 at the same time as the Turkish Democratic Party MP and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, he must have disappeared.
On 16 September 2015, at 15.10 a.m.: The book of the Death Travel Office will appear this week, not next week.
American Olympics in their book about their illness and becoming a prostitute
Three times in the Olympics, the new book by Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 500-metre runner, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book Fast Girl, tells about the ending of his career and becoming a prostitute.
The Sports Illustrated magazine published some interruptions from the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton decided his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the competitions in top shape and ran in the cartilage for the second best time.
In the final, however, he was panicked.
He immediately rushed to the top and defended his seat on the ground run.
150 meters before the goal, however, his power was exhausted.
He fell on the track surface, and the other competitors bypassed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
However, I pushed myself over the finish line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
Later, it was revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from a two-way mood disorder.
His brother, Dan, had done a year before Sydney's race of suicide, and he himself felt huge success scores.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
There was no economic problem, but he was fascinated by the idea of having sex with strangers.
He also said his husband would accept his actions.
Favor Hamilton's taxi was 450 euros per hour.
He says he spent the money on his luxury life.
One of Favor Hamilton’s explanations of prostitution was that he also missed the same adrenaline tricks as he had been competing in a public sport.
Later, Favor Hamilton discovered that he had a two-way mood disorder.
The double life of the former star runner was revealed at the end of 2012 when the Smoke Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics.
In 2000, he was at 1500 metres in the world's statistical circle at 3.57.40, but remained the last at the Sydney Olympics.
The world champion was delighted when the Union placed the Norwegian ski resort in control of: \"Suchly clear.
Norwegian ski club Petter Northug has exceeded the limits of suitability in the opinion of at least one of its colleagues.
Northug and Norway's ski union have been bending through the last year of the summer and autumn as well as the sports deal.
Although the alliance has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been suitable for several world champions and Olympic champions either.
As a result of the dispute, the Norwegian Ski Association decided to close Northug out of the world cup of the coming period.
The decision was thanked by the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad that the union put the ski resort under control.
Thank you for showing me the spine, Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
“We can’t allow an active athlete to avoid working for the sponsor of the union, he continued.
The dispute between Norway and Northug is about money.
Northug seems to want to be part of the country team so that he can advertise his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent a union that will also take care of future generations, and will not give one athlete to the solos.
At the same time, he reminded me that Northug has given both economic and other privileges for several years.
I know because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not agree that a single athlete has quite different rules than just because he is the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own release, in which he assured me he wanted to play sports in Norway next season in World Cup, as well as in World Cup and Olympic Games.
Astrid Jacobsen won six MM medals in all his career, two of which were gold.
He was involved in the team that won the media gold last winter in Falun.
The Christmas Day of the Painters is also celebrated in the North
On the race day of 25 September, the paces will be held at different restaurants and stores, which have been granted the shield of the Paistin translators.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland’s high-quality food expertise and reduce the threshold of departure to the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, it is recalled that not all high-level restaurants are concentrated in the metropolitan area, but top restaurants checked and categorized by a neutral operator can be found throughout Finland.
The international attention given to the event is an indication of the importance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of thyroid restaurants and organizations.
On the north of the country, the day is held in Vaasa in the restaurants Foundation and Kantarellik.
In Kokkola, the old town restaurant takes part in the race day.
The event has also received significant international attention.
The event has been decided to make the organization one of the most important international events that will take place in different parts of the world during the same day.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kahahaoki magazine: Appealed to the Chancellor of Justice for the establishment of Kauhava reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a refugee reception centre in the premises of the Kauhava ex-space currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the area is still permanently located in a critical infrastructure of crisis time, which is the use of the Defence Forces and its partner, the Finnish Special Networks Oy.
Kauhakoki says that, according to a private person, the placement of the reception centre in the same building structure would constitute a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interest in the area and airport of the former Airport, whose impact has also not been investigated when preparing the reception centre.
In the case of Kauhava airport, negotiations have been held over the last two years on the organisation of flight training and the outcome of a potential foreign operator at the airport.
This has been discussed, among other things, by Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and Deputy Minister of Defence, Mr. Arti Rädy.
The private person tells the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not about the principle of the reception centre, but about the fact that the planned place in the former backup area is wrong.
The Kauhava City Government dealt with the reception centre on Monday.
Niinistry: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The administration means that immigrants and those who are here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö commented on the evening journalists after meeting with the presidents of all parliamentary parties in his seat in Mäntünniemi.
According to the President, concerns about the management of the refugee situation were united with all the participants.
He considers it valuable that the government and opposition parties in Finland are able to discuss confidentially the fundamental issues.
Especially when we face great challenges.
The so-called “Syrian situation” and the actions of Russia and the United States in the region can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region.
It is desirable for dialogue to evolve.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the tension in the situation in the Baltic Sea.
The NATO issue was also discussed in the debate.
The President did not take a position in the labour market situation.

The Association of Raitio and Metro Staff told STT about it tonight.
Most of the originals are closed for two hours, including mail closed

The Early Education Agency promises to inform the Agency of any changes to the activity tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, communication requires a wide range of channels, and the Prime Minister’s television and radio calls are one channel among others.
This channel of direct speech will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä said to the journalists in the parliament.
The Sipilä did not want to evaluate how often the prime minister’s television and radio calls would become.
According to Sipilä, speech may not always be transmitted in the future with Ylen channels.
If other channels are registered as channels, then let's see.
We're using this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires television and radio speech for citizens.
This matter, which is now being discussed, is rather complex and requires a longer justification.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä found out.
The speech will be sent at 21.05-21.20 both in TV1 and Radio in Finland.
You can also watch it in Yle Areena.
Spipilä takes a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä’s television speech will not tell you more about the government’s inwards.
Is it an effort to take the right to define a public debate more strictly into their own hands and to refuse a public debate on questions?
Foreign Minister (Timo) Soin’s recent comment that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to be defined himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these things are not related.
I understand that the commercial media is upset about the notification of Sipilä.
It would be weird if the media field didn't respond.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not reported in democracy.
It is the responsibility of media representatives to make clear that politicians’ agendas are not being adopted.
The TV call is a big risk to Sipilä.
In his speech, we should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the extraordinary high expectations set for the speech.
Is there more that we have heard today?
Or can he speak in a different way or in different words or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only the same old ones in the permit, you have to wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an extraordinary time.
This is a risk if it is not a special situation, but a routine speech among others.
The danger is that Yle will be identified as a message from politicians or parliament and government, which will certainly not be in accordance with Ylen’s interest or general policy.
Sipple Door Bet
In the future speech of the Sipilä, it is also important what the prime minister leaves without saying, the media researcher emphasizes.
In the evening, you will have to look closely at where Sipilä is missing and where it is not, says Heikki Kuutti, research coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
Six said the TV speech is a smart bet from Sipilä, because this is how this can bring up its own view without a ringtone.
This will give the message a large audience without a journalistic filter, unlike at a conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The symptom bypasss the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a danger that the media interprets something wrong about the speech, because precise questions cannot be asked.
The moon says it's very important how Sipilä appears on TV - a leak of sweat, whether the hands are shaking.
He compares Sipi to the father figure, which now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can do well, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government knew something about it, because in this man as if he spoke directly to another person.
This is what Obama and his partners do regularly.
Very exceptional
A political researcher, Erkka Railo, considers the Prime Minister’s speech to be very extraordinary for the citizens.
He said that it has not happened for decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
The extraordinary time requires extraordinary means, Railo says.
The researcher believes that this is what the Prime Minister wants to make Finns compassionate to the tensions in front of them.
On Friday, the remuneration organizations will hold protests and strikes against the government's actions.
On Twitter, President of the Left, Paavo Arhinmäki said that Sipilä could speak about the state of the nation in the House as a declaration by the Prime Minister, which would allow the speech to be discussed.
The SDP president, Mr Rinne (Sd.), once again announces that he is challenging the Sipilä dialogue.
Now is not the time for monologists.
Six months of election.
You can't hide in the finals, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy was found in Tampere
The boy was in good condition at the time he was found.
The boy’s father updated his Facebook page.
The Internal Finland Police Department will also confirm the issue to the West.
The boy went out to play at four o'clock in the afternoon.
Later in the evening, he was no longer contacted.
Father thank you to all the people who have helped in the search.
Thanks for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was divided closer to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time.
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed in the violence of young people: You can hate it.
The Kurdish freelancer Makwan Amirkhani published a video on Facebook, which appeals specifically to young people with migrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani was forced to speak against young street fights.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and reached his family at the age of five, has so far won both of his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amikhani says he received a message asking to see an Instagram account.
Videos have been downloaded to the account where young people fight extremely violently.
Amikhani says he's disappointed in young people's wildness.
A 26-year-old Amikhan has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick the ground, sit on the other side, and unwittingly strike any of the consequences of this, when you make such videos, Amirkhani updates.
It’s hard to defend
Some of the young people in the video are immigrants.
According to the Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinonen, fighting videos on social media have been downloaded by both immigrants and Finnish youth.
I'm sure you're fighting on the street.
You are making so many other immigrants’ lives more difficult in Finland, Turkish Amirkhani reminds you.
Amikhani reminds me that there are sites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become very gross.
A little bit difficult, boys, to defend you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be quite a long guest here.
That's a little different way of thanking you for being here, Amikhani says.
Amikhani calls on young people to remember their loved ones.
If they sometimes become the object of some racism, then you will be able to accuse yourself of it.
Now, think about it a couple of times before you go into this, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action gives stakes to racism.
You're gonna make me hate what I don't like myself.
You've got a lot of things going on, and you're not going to cure them, Amikhani decides.
SAK to put its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
Mr Lauri Lyly, Chairman of the SAK, said on Twitter that the employee organisation will consider its position on Monday on the alternative savings list.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK's proposal on Twitter.
On Wednesday, STTK informed the Government of its proposal to achieve the 5% productivity gap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre).
The president of the plan, Mr Fjäder, believes that the Government will accept the proposal if the SAK, STK and the Plan are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest payer organisation SAK will soften its previous position.
Mr Lauri Lyly, president of the SAK, commented on the issue in a small way on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss this issue on Monday.
According to Lyly, the SAK is looking for solutions to open the labour market lock, and the position of the law requires active parties to enter into agreements.
Lyly recalls that Prime Minister Sipilä's proposal for a social agreement did not qualify for the SAK.
The Sipilä cut off earlier negotiations on the social agreement when the SAK refused to agree to commit to the 5% productivity gap target.
Comment: Big impression is threatening the West - I know it's a little funny to wear fists.
It feels a little funny to wear fists, if you already have a matching paper in your pocket, write Pekka Tiinonen.
The moods vary from side to side in the employee camp.
Is it intended to call the government for annulment or, then, agree with it?
On Monday, the SAK’s all-in-laws broke out the sacred hatred of the government of the Republic.
Finland was threatened to shut down.
The threat spread to the apronists.
The training organisation OAJ threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, OAJ canceled: no school or kindergarten is completely closed.
On Wednesday, Mr Antti Palola (sd) was the chairman of the STKK organization.
He told the government that he had contacted and prepared the alternative proposal requested by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centred) for a 5% productivity gap.
The President of the Plan, Sture Fjäder (kok) immediately rushed to announce that his contract paper was already completed.
At first, the SAK office did not belong to the yard.
President Lauri Lylyn (Sd) is difficult to reach out to when allies just on Monday ordered the country to stand on Friday.
Finally, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to address the situation and that the SAK would look for solutions to open the labour market block.
In order to create a joint proposal for wage earners, the SAK should tend to accept the 5% productivity factor as a target.
There is no wonder that Palola STTK has a good relationship with the government of Sipilä.
The right hand of the ball, Jukka vinus, Head of Social Impact of the STTK, previously served as Special Assistant of the Central Ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kivinieme.
The fire also described that the government’s ay-sacrifice has been improving all the time.
Accident or not, but Palola's exit took a little clean off from Finland's standers, whose photo of the wedding was Marko Rajainen (sd).
It feels a little funny to wear fists if you already have a matching paper in your pocket.
Modified at 18.00: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: \"This cannot be repeated.
Russian President Sergei Naryshkin criticized the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
Russian President Sergei Naryshkin said Mongolia is better than the father of Etyj in Finland.
At the Uran Bator in Mongolia, the Etyj Parliamentary Assembly has launched a session in which Naryshkin gave a wide-ranging comment on the Helsinki July Meeting.
At that time, Finland did not allow the arrival of Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who had forced the European Union to enter the meeting - a matter from which the President repeatedly reminded journalists.
In our opinion, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This cannot be repeated, Naryshkin stressed the news agency according to Interfax.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only by Finland and the EU, but also by the United States, where his access had been blocked.
Sanctios are a political suicide from the EU, declared by Naryshkin.
Mongolia's Russian delegation got a little complicated, so Naryshkin continued to pick up Finland with praise and praise for Mongolia's specific organisation.
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results, unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The leaders of Mongolia understand that parliamentary dialogue does not have to be an obstacle.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (kok) who, according to the Russian media, has already discussed with the Russian délegation.
The lock meets the real playoff mirror: \"Matthews tightly –
The killer and the Luk will continue today in Hakamets, as both are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that today at Hakamets there is no real goal party.
Tappara went to Kuopio yesterday to grab a 3-2-way win from KalPa.
The rise was manly, because the last season’s silver group was at its worst two goals of defeat.
The lock on Tuesday was more molly-powerful.
As a guest of the Blues that started as a guarantee, the Raumas saw a round zero point, and the loss rates were also 2-3.
Hard game, paints tight, if any of you play the same game as last year, Lukku shocker Janne Lahti anticipates the settings on the club's pages.
The killing has become quite a playoff button for the Raumas.
In the past two seasons, Tappara has just dropped from the final series of Lukko.
On both floors, the solution has been required to determine the seventh match.
In the last season, Lukk took the series to a chandelier in the fourth game, but Tappara rose on the next three breasts and passed.
There are no major changes in the compositions of groups except for paint foams.
Both of those who fought last night are going to be on the summit today.
With the goal of killing, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhus, and between the Lukku poles, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
View angle: The story is running a terrible play
Toivola, the sports director, wrote a post of non-conforming coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote the Rocky film, where he himself played the main part.
The subserviator censored the world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a big sympathy, even though he eventually lost the title match.
After thirty years of Rocky's first night, Mika Toivola wrote a breathless ash-motor to Pori.
The nameless and wooden-hand pasta came to everyone as a surprise to the SM-finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but tough sub-optors like Rocky.
There was a White Indian, Porin Matt, and Pele Pelto.
In the fall games, the players dyed their heads red and cut the iroques.
Hope became a blonde.
A remarkable TV browser, JP Jalo, called the coach Neumann.
They took the winning silver.
Hope was one of the heroes.
The author, Toivola, believes that the novelty of this season works in the same way as it was ten years ago.
A man who works as a musician has built a potion for bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been dumping waste in the far end like Rocky pigs at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäe, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen are in some other way than in the field.
Hopela has forgotten that Rocky VI plays the main part in Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi is crucified by the Ironallion Sean Connery.
Rautallio is a leading performer in the Rocky script written by Toivola as a leading character as Connery would have been in the 1976 original work.
There's nothing else in the Iron Hall than a nickname.
The game philosophy of the Ironallion is not part of running and running.
He appreciates a tough game, but it's a different thing to play hard than a pig.
In the last season, the Ässien Garret Stafford coated Tapparan Jere Karjalainen head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Rautaallio put the man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only have those who deserve it.
I don’t accept such a game and it doesn’t belong to an ass-hot, a hot walk from Rautakallio woke up after the game to the people of Satakun.
The team of this season is strangely built.
There are trains, veterans, policemen, and bullies.
There are no key players at the best game age.
No wonder the head coach has complained of a magician.
How much have you been able to influence the player’s acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of the past season affect procurement, and unfortunately the situation on the market was rather limited, Rautakallio responded diplomatically.
Under the surface, you'll be able to do it.
In 1953, Rautakallio is known to be interested in moving to the place of Toopola as a sports bomb.
Men's contracts end in the spring.
In the three leagues of the Aces balance period there are as many losses with the goal difference of 1-6.
It would not have been worth writing a copy of the script.
Olga Temone plays the mother of Sipe Santapuki
Olga Temone reveals that if he had met his husband Tuuka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temone is the first time to act in the direction of his husband.
Yes, I'll show my husband's mother in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
She has been married to Apulanta's ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temosen since 2008.
The couple has done a lot of work together before, but for the first time Olga is in the direction of Tuuka.
Olga's role in the early years of Apulanta, you made us a beautiful movie with a drummer Sipe Santappuk's mother Sirkka.
Sirkka empopus and supports his son, even though this father Risto (which is played by Lorenzo Backmann) is trying to be a voice of reason.
The more I’ve familiarized my true example of Sirikka, the easier to play a role seems to go.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuk for trusting me in the role.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but since then, the two of them have approached a lot.
They've met, talked on the phone, and they've been communicating.
The circus has helped a lot.
We have been through a lot of different angles in their history.
Fortunately, Sirkka also understands that drama is drama and the truth may need to be a little colored.
Olga emphasises that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulä would become the largest band in Finland.
In the 1990s there was a recession and a real anchor.
There was quite a small probability that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had some intuition, and she was right.
Olga says he had heard a lot from Tuuk about this youth before the film plans.
However, parents’ stories have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were doing.
Olga reveals that his own youth was completely different from Heinola's evil-looking sciarter known as Tuuka.
Olga was a smart and nice girl who had nothing to do with the movie Tuuka.
He could have been a secret lover.
According to Olga, he has worked so much with Tuuka over the past 10 years that the big joint project is not afraid.
Everything has always been super good.
Now the whole production group will go to Heinola for a month.
However, a couple living in the East is often planning to drive home for the night because of their little children, because the distance is not too long.
We'll take over the whole month of Heinola.
They have taken us very warmly, asking us which streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 was the most expensive film in Finland.
Iron Sky, directed by Timo Vuorensola, has a budget of 17 million euros.
The photos begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola starts filming Iron Sky 2 in October Belgium.
The sequel of Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will be the most expensive play film ever in Finland with a budget of 17 million euros.
In the past, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been on the Big Gam of the Jalmari Helander.
The Angry Birds animation in the works will also rise after graduation by Iron Sky 2, as the film’s budget is over €100 million.
The films directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa begin in October near Antwerp in AED Studios premises and last for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium next week.
There's no fear of a waste budget.
I've been a sick man!
I have such a relaxed script because I know exactly what kind of movie should be like.
Everyone in the team seems to realize that something is being done unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, she's telling the magazine.
Originally, the film had a budget of 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
The budget is big, but it's a big story.
However, 100 million people should be stuck in the film because each image and performance are so expensive.
Now everything is so tight that there is no finding.
Iron Sky Universe launched a crowdfunding campaign and a crowd loan that pays 4-8% annual interest rate on Wednesday.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and offer during the campaign.
In the last two years, the company will pay the loan back.
The film shows, among other things, Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junt or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Trenders’ breasts have recently been decorated by big logos.
Even a while ago, a fashionable dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocsja.
Advertising a hood or a T-shirt mark was seen as a train.
But times change.
Sport has become a real fashion megatrend, and so have the old, familiar sports fashion characters such as Adidas and Nike have risen to the cool wave.
And, as often before, the boundaries of the funny and trendy ones are afloat: if something is already right, it starts to become iron and cool.
First came the norm of the core trend, i.e. the tavis fashion, where trends were surprised by favoring as boring basic clothes as possible as a means of separation from mass.
Now, instead of the gray basic college, it’s already the net shirt buried on the bottom of the cabinet, in front of which the manufacturer’s logo is shown.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to logos, for example, Adidas’ recognizable track nets, the favorite team’s gaming shirts and the New York Yankees flags have made a return to the street fashion.
The edge of the jeans begins to mock the beginners Calvin Klein logos are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the breast of Versace’s warts makes it clear which sign of clothing it is about.
Would you be willing to present logos in your dress?
The Russian politician released the evidence: I didn’t get stuck in the tank’s hatch!
According to the claims, a special incident would have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo was held in 2015.
In recent days, the Russian media has spread colourful claims that the Russian Emergency Ministry had to remove large sizes of Zotovia from the tank hatch for five hours.
Since then, Zotov has done everything he can to deny the information.
He even published on his own public Facebook page a picture where he seems to be cursing a armored vehicle in very good moods, and at least because of these images, it is not about being stuck or angry.
Full of nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't enter the battle tank, but it was a hit-and-run BMP-3.
I am a former soldier, Colonel, I have served in Ural.
I went in there, looked around and came out peacefully, and Zotov said to Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I didn't get stuck and I didn't really spend five hours in that position, he said.
At the Russian military television channel, Zotov explained in the exhibition that he was looking for a new Russian technology, because he is a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the wagons, and I wanted our technology.
And I came out through the back door, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And in the next show, I will definitely visit all tanks and all attack tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called for the stupidity of the journalist who wrote it.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside and came out.
I'm long and ratty, but nothing like being stuck in a tank didn't happen, he said to Russkaja sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov’s words support the fact that no photograph of the alleged Jews has been published, although there were a total of 50,000 people in the gun show in a few days.
The claim of Zotov's invading began with the Bloknot.ru site, where Zotov was told to pull out of the tank hatch when he tried and threatened to shoot all those around him, unless he got out of his surface.
Later, the Bloknot website published a sequel in which the exhibition organizers reported their views about what happened.
Everyone is just used to the fact that soldiers quickly jump out of armored vehicles.
But MP Zotov, due to his big size, simply delayed when he came out.
But he never sat in it for five hours, said the exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevski to the Blocks.

Aggnico Eagle Finland’s Kittilän mine has been leaked.
The refined process water of the gold mine has leaked from the so-called enrichment sandfall to the stream.
According to the company, measures have been taken to correct the leak.
The pool has a foam process of neutralized enrichment sand and purified process water.
In general, water is pumped to either be reused as process water or administered in accordance with the permit through the surface rolling field to the environment.
The year was estimated to be about 300 cubic meters per hour when it was observed.
According to the company, the quality of the leak water meets the current permit conditions.
No other substance was poured into the environment.
The year was observed during the inspection round on Monday morning.
There has been no structural damage to the dam's dam structures.
The company will cooperate closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred regular workers.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish country report published today by the International Monetary Fund follows the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation put forward structural reforms covering Finland in order to cope with economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overwork compensation and paid holidays would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire contractual system and for unemployment protection.
Danske Bank’s main economist Pasi Kuoppamäki said structural reforms would agree, but there are also small differences.
The IMF estimates that there is a great deal of compassionate communication to the government, but there is also a warning about what should not be cut too much.
For example, infrastructure investments, Kuopamäki says to Economics.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF expects Finland to have 0.4% economic growth this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
Today, Danske predicts that growth will remain zero in its new economic forecast this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have been the basis for the latest observations.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total production was in the summer of small growth, says Kuopamäki.
Less attention may have been paid to reduced confidence in industry or to other so-called softer meters.
However, there are only a few percent of the decimals.
Nintendo, who recovers from death, appointed a new leader.
In July, Tatusami Kimishima, a cancer cancer worker working under Satoru Iwata, began her work on Wednesday, Nintendo said Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
Iwata, for example, responded to a successful Wii console launch.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that was raised as possible followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata’s footprints, assesses Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
The task of Kimishima is to take Nintendo heavily into mobile games, but not to eat bread on the traditional gaming consoles of the company.
More and more minor asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Finnish Immigration Service recognised that hundreds of children who have come to the country would disappear every year.
According to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of minors are lost each year.
Chief Inspector Juha Kannelmaa of the Finnish Immigration Service explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is the same situation in Finland?
How much is lost in the country of less than a year?- In Finland, a total of 156 asylum applications were made in 2013 alone.
9 of them disappeared.
In 2014, similar applications were made in 196, and 11 of them disappeared.
In the background of the disappearance, it may be that the applicant is already registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of age there.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue processing the case in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for the processing of the application.
Similarly, some of the missing will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 applications were subject to a decision to terminate because the applicant had probably moved out of Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared in the past 123 years, he said.
Is the amount of growth?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications for a minor who has come alone.
There are no overall statistics on the missing minor asylum seekers this year, but the number of minor applicants is known and has grown clearly, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons, he stresses.
What happens to those who have received the conversion decision?
For example, do you lose them to the dark labour market?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the enforcement of conversion decisions is carried out by the police, Kannelmaa stresses.
Minister of Home Affairs Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of non-registered people.
He has taken action on this issue.
During the EU’s internal minister meeting, Orpo said on Monday about practical measures to manage asylum seekers’ flows through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A studio online - see photos of devices
Due to hospital attacks, the equipment used for the production of television and radio production by Timo T.A., who lost their ability to work in the media sector, is now in sales.
Mikkkonen's spouse, Nina Mikkonen, sells Huuto.net devices, which were at the time the most advanced professional tools in their field.
The Internet announcement was first published by Iltamakasin.
Today, much of the equipment is left behind in technological development.
In the digital media world, television programs are no longer available for Betacam.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that interested ones can be found.
Of course, the equipment is no longer in the same way, but these are also needed as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also many enthusiasts - collecters and own studio builders, Nina Mikkonen is thinking about IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset is trying to move away from their current Myrskylä home.
We can't take all the supplies with us.
I've been inventing a little bit and watching where the goods are being donated.
This is where I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no longer any use for television and radio devices.
It is clear from the evidence that a long career-making man no longer returns to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkkonen’s real life was archived in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to the box shop to pick up films and other materials from Myrskylä.
Traffic threatens to drill worse: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
The drivers of the metro and trams decide today whether to expand their efforts in relation to the demonstration of the Friday.
The original plan was to stop the tram and tram traffic only for the time of the demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon it will be decided whether the traffic will stop for the whole day.
Chief Consultant Pekka Hirvonen says that the threat is great in the field.
Night-and-day cuts are very painful for drivers, so the plans of the government to cut the glasses are a source of resistance.
However, it is a kind of dilemma to stop traffic throughout the day.
If the metro and trams stand on Friday, public transport in the metropolitan area is practically completely stopped.
According to VR data, trains do not travel between the morning and the evening.
On Friday, there will be no long-distance or long-haul traffic.
The trains leaving before the morning will be driven to the destination stations.
According to HSL data, most buses remain in shadows.
The members of the ACP will be gone from work on Friday from 3 a.m. to 3 a.m. on Saturday morning.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, they are driven by the supervisor, the HSL informant Pirkko Repo suggests.
Repo says that HSL is unable to tell exactly what bus routes are going on Friday.
Remuneration organizations will host a major demonstration at Helsinki Rautatientor on Friday 11-13.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place at the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, says AP.
Sky News says the refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled the panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water guns against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at the school in Texas, and the teacher thought he was a bomber.
In Texas, the 14-year-old Ahmed Mohammed has been arrested since the teacher considered him to be a bomb bomber.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he wanted to introduce his electronics industry to the output.
However, one of the teachers thought that the clock looked like a bomb.
The police were invited to the scene, and the situation ended in the end that the boy was taken to the youth detention cell in the cuffs.
Muhammad has not been found at any time to claim that he had made a watch.
Yet, it is still possible that the boy will be accused of making a false bomb.
According to Mohammed, the police said the clock looked like a movie bomb.
The clock is in custody of the police, but it was known to have been made up of a circuit board and a digital display between which there were wires.
The incident occurred last Monday, and Mohamedia was punished for three days by forced school leave.
His father is angry about the case, and the American Council of America wonders whether the case is another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
British President Labour refused to sing a national song
In the song, God is asked to protect the queen, but Corby is the opponent of monarchy.
The review of the poll by the polling press has also been joined by the representatives of the Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has offended the people, according to the Labour spokesman Kate Green, in the BBC radio interview.
Green said Corbyn should have joined the song.
Last night, the Battle of British Air Force pilots against the German Luftwaffe in 1940 was respected.
The Labour Party defends Corbyni in its official statement and stresses his respect for the pilots by taking part in the event.
We are all in a huge debt of gratitude for the heroism of Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood silently during the national song, the opinion highlighted.
Corbyn's choice as party leader has divided the lines of the labour.
In particular, there are those who fear that he will ban moderate voters from his radical views.
Corby supports unilateral armament, stop saving and increase public spending.
Corbyn is scheduled for the first time to appear in the capacity of the party leader in Parliament at the hearing hour of the Prime Minister.
Mr Corbyn has asked the public to make proposals on what should be asked by Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron chose Corbyn as a party leader on Twitter.
The Labour Party is threatening the security of our national security, our financial security and our families, the Prime Minister's reference to your account.
The reason for Minnesota's family death is still unclear - the family's father was waiting for the case.
South Lake Minnesota Police have been investigating a family death in Minnesota Greenwood for a week.
The five-person family was found dead in their home on September 10, and a couple of days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family Brian Scott Short, 45.
First, after shooting his wife and three children, Brian Short killed himself in the house garage.
Dead days already
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of children.
Based on this announcement, the police went to the house for inspection visits and found a huge house dead in the Short family.
StarTribune said it was possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Million House and Successful Company
The investigation of the case of the South Lake Mintonka police officer Michael Siair is still ongoing.
The motive for blood is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property on the social media site of the nurses at AllNurses.com.
In the 2014 StarTribune interview, Short reported that there were four million visitors on the site each week.
I’ve had 50 purchases from the company in the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to do.
Maybe at some point I'm selling a company, but not yet.
The success was seen, among other things, by the short family buying two million dollars of a cozy house from Greenwood in 2011.
The house is advertised on the property site in Zillow as a dream of a car collector: there are not only 12 rooms in the house, but also eight cars with adequate garages.
Legal proceedings
StarTribune said the family’s father was waiting for a trial.
The Achieve Test Prep, which offers a variety of preview courses, had challenged him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prepin, no comments had been removed from Short’s website, and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
According to StarTribune, however, it is very unclear whether the case would have had a significant impact on Short’s transactions.
Vesku Loiri offered cake coffees
In addition, the owner’s third party was awarded at the Finnish Hippos’s month horse owner award.
This is great, Lois said in a good mood on his board of honors.
The party, Fabrice Duo, won Derby on September 1st and earned $100,000.
The artist legend Loiri was still confused about the success of Fabrice Duo in the big competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loir, the success horse coach Korpi gets full peace of work when working with the horse.
Pekka determines and decides where the horse will be taken to compete.
And I'll keep my mouth shut, Lois.
The great gesture of the NHL star -- the greatest talent ever made by a sportsman.
The Montreal Canadian Superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million (about $6.7 million) to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the medical statement, this is the most important donation ever made by a sportsman to charity in Canada.
In addition, the 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital in other financial collections for the next seven years.
Subban made a deal worth eight years and 72 million dollars a year ago with the Canadians.
The amount of Subban's donation is therefore significantly higher than his $9 million years.
As a reward for his donation, Subban receives his name from the hospital.
The Canadians have helped local hospitals significantly before.
A year ago, the long-time captain Jean Beliveau raised millions of dollars to the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a sum of money to the other city's major hospital that gave the hospital the necessary PET scanner for cancer studies.
Japanese coffee can be ordered by the wife for the evening - serves food only bikinis and roses on their head
The coffee is a hard thing in Japan.
The market already has a goat cafe, a chicken cafe, a vampire cafe, a cheap cafe and now a wife's cafe.
It strikes lonely, socialized and hungry.
It's news from Metro.
In Tokyo, Ore no Yome (my wife) coffee can be ordered for the evening of a wife or husband.
This is a waiter who pretends to be a customer’s spouse.
“Puoliso – is selected from the list before coming to the cafe and prepares and serves food.
The wife's only in front of the bust and bikinis on her head, and the husband's in tight bikes.
The website provides all the information about the length and weight of the wife’s candidates to the type of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: attacks against information security in cars were equipped
In addition, the Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) supports the technological development and innovation of the sector, the publication of Intel.
The board consists of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time Intel released the first version of the best practices of cybersecurity.
The company will continue to update the report on the basis of ASRB’s research results.
Gartner estimates that around 150 million vehicles in traffic have been connected to the network by 2020.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share online data.
We can and we need to improve the cybersecurity of cars, says Chris Young, Head of Intel Securities.
With the help of ASRB, Intel can establish the best practices on safety and support the view that cybersecurity is a major component in the design of each car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB Board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world’s leading innovators in data processing.
Ford Focus RS costs about 52,000 euros in Finland!
Ford Focus RS has been waiting for years as the moon rises.
Finally, the car will also be in the sight of Finland.
Ford has released RS data now that the car world's views are at the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Ford’s new four-wheel RS is accelerating from 2.7 seconds to a zero hundred and a peak speed of 266 kilometers per hour thanks to its 2.3-liter, 350-horizont engine.
Finland's interest is also the price, initially it is estimated to be 52,000 euros.
The car is already available, though, when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford will not tell you when it comes to information.
The favorite brand Kia presented two novelties at Frankfurt’s car show - such as the new Sportage and Optima
In Finland, the new fourth generation of Sportage is more important than the two new ones, with which Kia intends to capture the ever-growing crossroads market.
The new European design director, created by Gregory Guillaume, is more round than before.
There is a cent in the distance and exteriors, and the car is going to fly the air more efficiently.
The engine range is largely unchanged, but it has a 1.6-litre turbo that develops 177 horsepower.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance, as well as consumption, will be reported closer to the sales revenue.
We still have to wait a little bit for it, because we have a new Sportage coming in spring 2016.
Before the change of the year, our new Kia Optims arrived.
Suddenly, the news doesn’t seem to have changed, but it’s a whole new car.
Kia plans to conquer the hearts of top middle-class buyers with better driving features, lower noise levels and higher-level equipment.
Starting with a 1.7-liter turbo diesel and a 2.0-liter petrol engine, Optimos are available.
Next summer, the pace is accelerating when the Optima GT, equipped with a 2.0-liter turbo motor, comes next to them.
At the same time, the sale of Optima Farmer begins with its income.
Chisu returned to the stage - rapped in a brave haalarian boat
The singer Chisu is involved in the Life for the Child concert with other domestic stars.
The electric pants are equipped with an open neck hole.
The house is beautifully presented by the singer star's chip belt.
The whole is crowned by a golden metal belt and a red lipstick.
During a three-year break, the singer who became a mother has been forced to get pregnant with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will be over a year soon.
The singer released his first single album in August.
Getting back to the ships and the general public after a long break is not really exciting for me.
I have missed everything to do with music, the singer says.
Chisu will publish a new and fourth album called Polaris in a couple of weeks.
The new life situation has inspired us to make new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu thinks.
Kim Kardashian's mother-in-law style makes me feel like it's now showing up in the chest.
True-tv beauty Kim Kardashian gives speeches to one another.
She presents her pregnancy and breasts with an abstinence in sexy clothes, last night at one of America's last night, when she left her sister Kourtney Kardashian with her husband Kanye West's bowl.
Black maternity dress is transparent from the chests.
It reveals the skin-colored bras under the light of the lightning lights.
Last time Kardashian dressed for an amasonic maternity stand when he visited his friend at dinner parties in New York just a couple of days ago.
The agency highlighted the black upper-polenical boots.
The third special maternity dress is as fresh as last week’s Friday, when the performance was full of pregnancy.
The hard laws of the world: No home, you are lonely, the competition is terrible
Manon Leloup wanted to shorten the idea that the model world would be a clean glamour and a champagne party.
He made his own documentary, Speking Dolls, where Leloup and his colleagues speak of the clean model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine gathered six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season begins from scratch.
Even if in the previous season you would have been porcelain in the costumes of top designers, the new season will begin again in Casting.
And every season there will be new, fresh faces in the industry that compete with the convents.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and can go even a year in such a way that there is a hotel room or apartment in which fashion houses can accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother is unable to travel with you, loneliness can be unbearable.
New York and Paris are the desired jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There's not only one kind of weight loss.
Agent in New York may ask for a drop in pounds, but in Paris they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is always a risk game.
Fashion designers and designers are always together and work as a support network.
When the fashionians stop, the difference is tricky.
Models want this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they are pale at the fact that everyone thinks the work is just a demonstration of clothes.
Models also want to be their own person.
The work makes the models feel that they are actors with some role.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
Models on Tory Burch's screen yesterday.
In New York, fashion weeks are currently being held, where designers will reveal their next year’s model.
Roope Salminen, who has changed his style, plays the most famous Apulanta musician in the film
Roope Salminen plays Antti Lautala, the band’s founding member, in a film based on the early years of the Apulanta band.
Lautala founded in 1991 with Toni Wirtase, but separated from the band in 1994.
This is a big challenge for me because I'm a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I have not wanted to meet the right Antti before the descriptions because I want to make her my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown to people from that group, so I think it's okay to learn her playing style only from the video.
I don't want to make an impression of a man.
A man who trusts the Roope Salminen and Dogs is not a source of the role.
The punk mangers come naturally.
In the punk season of the star show, many of us must have seen the first taste, as well as if you've ever been to our gigs.
Our appearances have never been any small thing, but we always go full.
In 1993-2004, the main actors of the film, directed by Tuukka Temosen, were released today.
A core group known to the band is still quite unknown to the public by young actors.
Rumbali Sipe Santapukk is played by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtasta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temo Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a tip about his future nest yesterday evening, when he told Snapchat he was secretly preparing for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already published a picture of his new story on Instagram yesterday, which he has been forced to perform for the film.
The Roope, previously seen in the black and jaws, has turned his face into siloposchic, and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychological advice: This is how you tell children about refugees
Many parents have been forced to think over the last few days about how to tell children about the situation of refugees in Europe.
Or is it worth telling me at all?
There is no need to speak to the public, member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
Smaller children should be protected, for example, and not allowed to watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can remain in the mind and anxiety, he says.
However, if the child has encountered television news photos of refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth talking about.
It is good to have a conversation from the start of the child and listen carefully to what he asks.
The fear of the child may be surprising.
They may not be the ones that parents think he's afraid of.
You don’t need to be afraid of anything, even if you’re worried and scared.
A smaller child closely follows the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will also feel safe.
The older children are likely to talk about refugees in school, with friends or online.
It is good for parents to talk to them if it is a matter of thinking about a child.
The fact is that all people in the world are not well.
Parents, together with their children, can think about how to deal with this in our family.
In the end, is the world a safe or safe place?
Parents may also have different educational angles - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand, if the family is also talking about difficult things, the child will get a model of how to deal with the difficulties ahead of life.
This can be useful for him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: “ Teach your child to help you weaker –
Your strengths at the end?
You can still be a good parent to your child.
Vermos pallosalamaa hard to control
Perttu Pohjola was rubbed into the Apila Pallosalama in the middle summer.
It only ravaged the winnings and the two-wheelers until at the end of July in Tampere, there was a collapse.
Since the Ori was largely clogged, the coach suspected that something was wrong and ordered his passport for a period of time from the vet.
The explanation for stopping was found in the alphabet.
The horse had a sore throat.
The disease was not the most mildest to get, but the fall of it took two medications.
Since the Apilan Pallosalama had to be in light motion, Pohjola says he is welcome for the last run of the surprised horse.
It was in Turku after the second SE-dam after Taruntulle.
The Apila Pallosalama was very depressed when it could have been driven normally for just a few weeks.
Those things, with a small tendency at the end, were understandable, Pohjola says.
The coach assumes that a good competition made a steel for the Ori.
The horse must have moved on from it, and I hope it would have been even more balanced.
Apila Pallosalama has been so-called humor horses.
When you haven’t enjoyed it, it could have thrown you fat without getting sick.
On a good day orientees have instead removed such a mystery that the opponents have been in wonders.
At the speed of the pätkälä, the skiers will not be able to cope with Pallosalamaa, where even warm-blooded rides will be removed.
Pohjola's wishes are a mirror run in Vermo.
However, the different thing is how Apilan Pallosalama agrees.
It is quite difficult at the time of departure and may even fall under the boom of the departure car and such.
I hope the slave would be calmer than the departure of Turku.
The Apilan Pallosalama will be able to come out of the ring as well, and we will go on to drive it out of victory, coach promises.
That's why you can't get rid of the bad iPhone programs.
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of Apple's iPhone phones may be removed from future programs, but not all of them.
Apple will probably remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, says the CEO of the company Tim Cook Buzzfeed in an interview.
Apple's iPhone has a set of programs that are rarely used: FaceTime, Journalist, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcast and Vinkis come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which became an obsessive update to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple’s smart watch owners.
Cook said the removal of Apple programs is more complicated than it seems.
Some apps have been linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone applications work in close cooperation with other programs.
There are other programs that don’t work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop the way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is investigating this because the company does not want to waste memory from users’ iPhone phones.
Inflation in the euro area fell to 0.1% in August
In August, consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly by 0.1% year-on-year, the EU statistical authority said today.
The rise in prices was slowing down the price of energy.
In this way, Eurostat reviewed the 0.2% guarantee for a couple of weeks.
In July the inflation rate was 0.2%.
So-called basic inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
The Eurostat estimate was 1.0 per cent of the baseline inflation.
Energy was 7.2% cheaper in the euro area than a year ago.
The average inflation rate in the 28 EU countries was zero in August.
In July, the rise was 0.1 per cent.
Most of the euro area, i.e. 1.4 per cent of consumer prices, rose in August in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was the lowest as prices fell by 1.9%.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2% minus the EU's harmonised index rate.
Inflation in the euro area continues to be very far from the European Central Bank (ECB) target, which is a two-percent rate increase in the medium term.
The ECB expects inflation of 0.1% on average for the euro area this year.
Next year, the central bank will rise to 1.1% in its new inflation forecasts published at the beginning of September.
The U.S. Fed is now trying to blackmail monetary policy.
The U.S.’s next recession will begin at a speed of less than a year, but more likely within three years after the country’s central bank Fed starts to raise its interest rates again for a long time.
In the financial markets, the fall begins before the next recession.
Fed has suggested that the interest rates might start this week and not later than by the end of the year.
Thus, the next recession can be pushed at its fastest by next autumn and as a course for the financial market before.
Or at least this happens if the world's largest economy and financial markets work the way they've been, and if they react to the tension of Fed's money money as they've done before.
These conclusions have been concluded by the German bank Deutsche Bank's London market research strategies Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker for a wide range of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed over 60-page Long-Tem Asset Return Study to its international major customers last week.
The strategies drawn up by the study and the report do not believe they know exactly when Fed is going to raise its interest rates or what is going on in the economy and the market after that.
Instead, they present economic statistics with cool facts and calculations of how the economy and markets have behaved before and after Fed's interest rates.
In addition to historical observations, they will look at the key variables of the economy and financial markets now on the same or the other model as in previous interest rates - and what may be followed by it.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more horrifying state to withstand interest rates than ever before in the 1950s.
Not even a year at the beginning of the recession.
Fedi’s monetary policy and its respective vigour leaders have been hinting at the beginning of the summer and the beginning of the summer that the time begins to be ripe at interest rates.
The first interest rate for more than nine years can take place this week.
The matter will be settled during the Wednesday and Thursday, when the Board of Directors of Fed is meeting with the Open Market Committee to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
Last time, Fed raised its so-called Fed funds ratio in June 2006.
At the end of the same two years, the relatively regular but at a time a small series of 0.25 percentage points of interest that Fed raised its interest rate from 1.25 per cent to 5.25 per cent.
The financial crisis began in 2007 with the most risky housing funding difficulties in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis became a global nightmare of the Judgment Day.
A major recession arrived in 2009.
Last time, serious financial market and real economy failures began to slow down more than before Fed's interest rates have typically occurred.
Similarly, the trials were harder and tougher than ever since the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategies have been screening the rises and declines of the world's largest economies, as well as financial market fluctuations since 1950 and places from the beginning of the 19th century.
From Fed's interest and their financial and financial impact they have been making clear since the 1950s.
The fastest time to start the recovery has taken less than three years, most often less than three years, and on average less than three and a half years.
The financial market rise has ended within two years of the start of Fed's interest rates.
Fed has increased and in turn decreased its control rate by a dozen different cycles since the early 1950s.
Each time has been different from the others in some respects, and the odds have been relatively limited, so they can hardly conclude anything certain about the impact of the following interest rates.
The strategies remind us that this time many things are different.
And not just better.
Interest too low for too long
The reasons for the financial crisis may not necessarily be found indisputably by decades of research.
But three things about the leaders of the crisis and the reasons that have increased its destructive power must be somewhat undisputed:
1) In the 21st century, the Fed, the euro area ECB and the other world’s largest central banks considered their governance rates to be too low.
They met the traces of the technoupla, and then raised the next one.
2) Over the decades, the amount of debt accumulated in different parts of the financial and real economy, and above all, increased even greater than the monetary policy impact of central banks.
The largest debt bubble in economic history was born.
3) In particular, the crazy debt financing packaged to the financial economy, the largest exchange rate of shares in real estate, debt books and commodities, in most financial market areas, in the past.
Even so, it is hardly very difficult to argue that the financial markets that have risen to the highest levels in the event of more complex debt fluctuations were rarely dangerous and unstable when Fed and other central banks last drove up interest rates.
The financial structure of the debt relief funds was not as long as the valuation coupons had begun after the interest rates had started and the debt financing costs had turned up.
The risks took place as a financial crisis and resulted in a major recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
Deutsche's strategies do not think what's going to happen, but give the subject of nuclear activity by mentioning, for example, the following aspects:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now considered their monetary policy to be even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low before the crisis for too long, they have now been even lower.
2) For a long time, debt has not been crazy as it was ten years ago, but now debt money is at its cheapest literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the financial and real debt ratio has not been reduced, but now, in different parts of the economy, the debt burden is much more severe than before or before the financial crisis.
3) The liquidity that has been released from central banks has largely remained in the financial markets and has slowed the key types of securities and assets to the peak or ever before the financial crisis.
And not only are strategies of latina, but they also point out that even the U.S. economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and decades of the worst recession to that model than it has been before.
The euro area economy has barely recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in unusually weak condition, but the pressures and risks of the financial market are significantly higher than before the financial crisis, when Fed next starts to tighten its money out more tightly.
Perhaps the picture of Albert Edwards’ future is not as strange as it may suddenly be.
He has been coaching the bank's international investors for the following full translations:
First, Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles break down, and soon Fedin's time to shut down financial burns with even bigger QE money injections.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) is planning to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
Most of the reductions are directed at HP’s corporate service side, the company says.
HP is divided into HP Inc., the Hewlett Packard Enterprise and the consumer.
HP was the largest employee in 2011, with 350,000 employees.
Last October, the staff had been reduced to 302000.
The company accounts for a one-off cost of $2.7 billion (around €2.4 billion) from the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise reduces 25,000 to 30,000 employees.
The consumer side will be reduced to 3300 within three years.
HP plans to transfer its operations to low cost countries, with 60% of its employees being in low cost countries in 2018.
The company says that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers will be responsible for more than 10% of its operating profit.
In the second year, its three major customers accounted for 65% of their operating profit.
iOS 9: How to Get a New Operating System After Apple Update
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, clicking on the \"General\" and then selecting \"Soft Update\".
If the update is ready, the phone will allow you to download the option and then install it.
Some people have had problems since this installation when the screen has been released – Software update failed – error message.
To overcome this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst congestion to pass or try to update via iTunes.
The phone will guide the user in the end process.
This may include removing apps to get the status, but Apple has reduced this option by reducing the size of the update and also facilitating the process with a new tool that proposes removal applications and then reinstalling them when the update is completed.
It is worth ensuring that the phone is charged or the charger is close to the update that the battery will not end in the middle.
If the download level is too low, Apple will not allow the update to proceed, because if the battery is running out of the middle, it can lead to an update violation.

It is also worth ensuring that you have gone through our list of all the things you need to do before downloading, so that things don’t go wrong, and how you can protect yourself from it if they go. IOS 9 brings new features with you, such as a much smarter personal assistant and enormously new productivity features for iPad, as well as improvements that speed up and correct the operating system.
Yle: Minister Berner has worked in the government of the tax haven company
Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner (centrally) has been a member of the government of the tax haven.
According to Ylen, the company’s activities have been linked to the so-called tax planning.
This is a Luxembourg-based Saltri II LuxCo company appointed by Berner as a member of the Board in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still an official member of the Board of Directors.
Berner himself said he had left a notice of resignation in May of this year.
I checked it out and it's enough that I've left a notice.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place on an agreed schedule, Berner says in an interview with Yle.
Membership after fusion
Through the Luxembourg company, ownership of the Swedish Kährs company is managed.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer who merged with Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner worked with the Government of Karelia-Upoflor in 2010-2013 and after the merger with the Government of Kährs and the Luxembourg company.
According to Ylen, Kährs's ownership is transferred to Luxembourg through a multi-ported ownership structure.
Berner tells Yle that he received a government membership in the Luxemburg company Kährs at the request of the second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been involved in the Board of Karelia-Upoflor owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was asked for a partner found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my task was to take care of the capital of the Finnish family company.
It is important that we ensure that the revenues of our Finnish companies’ capitals are taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's owners are not related to tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure of tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs had already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership by Triton.
The reception centre operated by the company will be opened in Espoo
Espoo Otaniemi opens the first reception centre maintained by the company for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first hundred inhabitants from tonight.
The number of places can increase to a maximum of 300-400 people within a week.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre for the property of the former Rescue University.
The activity is maintained by Luona Oy, whose sector is primarily the production of health care and medical services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy are, among other things, agreed on the security arrangements of the Centre.
STTK prepares an alternative labour market tightening package
STTK is preparing an alternative package of government working hardships.
The organisation also hopes that other organisations of the Employee Centre will be involved.
According to President Antti Palola, today's attention is on Friday's demonstration.
Alternative means of reducing the cost of work will be returned after that.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola noted the organization’s administrative meeting at a break for journalists.
Palola estimates that the Central Economic Union (EC) is not ready for discussions.
STT’s economists have calculated that the change in the government’s competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million when the second half of the package is 2 700 million.
I don’t know if there’s a terrible enthusiasm on the part of the party to have a conversation if there’s a one-way relationship with a hundred.
Palola: Negotiation connection was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, as the government is to submit its own package of information to the Parliament and to start preparing for reforms.
Palola did not take a position on whether the schedule was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a dialogue with the government, and it has always been constructive for him.
In the field of STTK, especially for Sunday girls, Palola says it is a painful place.
The organisation requires that the government withdraws from the mandatory legislation to implement part of the blackmail.
According to the STK, Palola does not encourage the preparation of an alternative package with SDP.
On Friday, the employees will meet with Helsinki to oppose the work-related tightening package presented by the Government last week.
As part of the package, the salary of the first sick days is cut, the overwork compensation is halved, the Sunday compensation is reduced to 75% and the holidays are reduced.
The STTK emphasizes that central organizations have invited employees to protest, and that the purpose has not been to hold a strike.
Avan Fjäder
The President of the Plan, Mr Fjäder, congratulates the STKK for the announcement of the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, the STKK is now coming into the same lines with the Plan, since the Plan has already set up an alternative model for the government's presentations.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also be included in an alternative package, because without the SAK the package is not sufficiently comprehensive.
A plan president, Mr Fjäder, hopes that the SAK, led by Mr Lauri Lyly, will prepare the proposal for surgery.
Antti Palola's STKK said earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, the plan announced that it had long prepared its own proposal to negotiate the country’s government’s goal of achieving a 5% competitive jump as an alternative to cuts.
The plan has been ready to negotiate all the time, and we have long written an alternative model for government presentations.
We are ready to see the terms of the service as part of the contract.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, says Chairman Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also enter the Plan lines, as the STK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without the SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now preparing a model for the government and employers of the country, Fjäder says.
The proposed Bureau will meet on Thursday at 15 a.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
\"The same boat, the common coal, the loots - play bingo while talking to Sipilä in the evening
the University of Tampere Green Left
The Green Left of the University of Tampere for the evening.
The Prime Ministers have previously held exceptional talks during the rebellion and wars in Mäntsälä.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finland’s economy on the Ylen channels on Wednesday at 21.05.
When applying for a similar speech, the Prime Minister must go until 1932, when the Prime Minister, Mr Evind Svinhufvud, held a famous radio call that marked the beginning of the end of the rebellion in Mäntsälä.
After that, the President and Ministers held a number of radio calls during the Winter and Continue War.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho held a New Year's Speech instead of Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen stopped on television with a phone call from the train drivers' strike.
Single call, monarchist makeup
The talk of the Sipilka has raised all day's criticism and guesses about what I'm going to do.
On Twitter, President of the Left, Paavo Arhinmäki said: “Silpä could speak about the state of the nation in the House as a declaration by the Prime Minister, which would allow the speech to be discussed.
According to Green Ville Niinistö, an exclusive call has already been seen.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, the SDP Erkki Tuomio condemned that “mono-architectural makeup: the Prime Minister tells the people what’s best for it.”
Mr Rinne, president of the SDP, challenged the Sipilä dialogue: “It has been six months since the election.
Not a single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's tried.
What are you afraid of?
Public service
According to the Government Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, it was directly commented by SAK President Lauri Lyly and EC CEO Jyri Häkä Man.
It is highly appreciated that the speech of Sipilä has been made.
We considered the issue and said that it is part of the public service mission to promote the entire public sector of Finland, in the news of Ismo Silva Yle, the director of Yle’s publications.
As in the time of the Tammels
The speech has also brought up an atrocities.
The dinner will be enjoyed in good time, the kids will be combed and put on their best.
Mom puts on a nicest skull, and her father agrees with her neck.
At 9 p.m., it will be silenced by the TV as before before the time of the We Tammelians,\" wrote Saku Timonen.
“In the speech of Prime Minister Sipilä, we also ask why the government of Finland is sitting in tax havens of millions of dollars hiding their capital capital, who are making the mercy laws for their fellow taxiers and, at the same time, claiming to the people that it is necessary to cut the money when the government is out of money, asks Pia Lohikoski.
From what Sipilä says, one guess shows the Green Left Viva of Tampere University.
It has been published on Facebook by the next bingo.
Can we hear about the same boat, the common coal, the living of the debtors and the team spirit?
Coupons and pens ready, at 21.05 it starts and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: the Western countries rejected the Russian proposal for the deportation of al-Assad
Over three years ago, the Western countries rejected the Russian offer of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria to give up power, according to President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian U.N. Ambassador proposed a plan for al-Assad to leave the power in style after some time.
However, the Western countries did not accept the proposal because they believed that Al-Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
The Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurk, in a bilateral debate, listed a three-point plan for him: the opposition could not be armed, the opposition and al-Assad had to be immediately contacted and the abandonment of al-Assad had to be carried out in a controlled manner.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree with all of these things, but we are able to speak openly.
I told him what I did there, and he said to sit down, Martti, and I'll tell him what to do, Ahtisaari reminds me of Guardian's interview.
Diplomatics do not comment
The Ahtisaari tells us that Tshurkin's message was delivered to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion to the newspaper, but Ahtisaari said there are no two words for it.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari’s claims, but said that at that time the al-Assad forces had already committed several mass killings and the central opposition groups refused all the agreements that would have left him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former director of the Middle East Department of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, expressed doubts about the speech of Ahtisaari, because, according to his experience, Russia was not ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad at any time.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
In a moment, Ahtisaari's claim is that Tshurkin spoke with Moscow's authority.
If he had told me about the words of Tshurkin, I would have answered that I would like to hear from President Vladimir Putin so that I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would have suspected that it would have been Putin's rock to keep power with some al-Assad supporter.
The exhaust current of our own actions
During the negotiations in Ahtisaari, about 7,500 people were killed in the Syrian crisis.
According to the UN estimates, the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the year.
More than 11 million people have fled their homes because of war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own actions.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we have caused ourselves, Ahtisaari says to the magazine.
Asylum Seekers’ Organisation Centre on Storm Tower
The asylum search organisation centre designed by the Government in North Finland is likely to be established in Toronto.
The centre would be set up in the building of the empty tower joint-lyse building in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable place to better manage refugee flows from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat announced Tuesday that the council had already decided to present the school building as a temporary solution to the ministry.
According to the City Council Vice-President Sauli Hööppinen (left), it is not true.
When the entire delegation was not gathered and some of the people wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the council meeting to decide on the matter next Monday, he specified it to the STT.
At the local discussion, 36 of 43 were authorised.
The organisation centre was opposed by 13 authorised persons.
Based on this, the decision could be expected to be positive, says Hööppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday and quickly responded.
There would be an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has been checking that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple hundred meters from the border, so it would also work in that sense, says Nousiainen.
Sipilä is still hoping for an alternative to the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centrally), half of the public holidays would only be managed by part of the government’s efforts to calculate the cost of work.
However, the government is pleased to accept an alternative package if the social partners succeed in reaching such an agreement.
Sipilä told the journalists that he had not been involved in the labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously the organizations were looking for alternatives to the government's announcement of working tensions.
If such an agreement is created, we will be happy to accept it as part of the entire package.
In Sipilä’s view, half of the money would be a means of working, because it would be directed at almost all payers, unlike, for example, the government’s planned Sundays cut.
The labour market organisations could agree on the cuts in holidays between themselves, because they are registered in collective agreements instead of law.
The Government will present this vision to the Parliament next week on Wednesday about the tensions in working life in the form of a government communication.
According to Sipilä, the proposals of organisations should be known before this.
This is not the final back line either.
The legislative work will then start to move, i.e. the train is moving and it will get harder all the time.
Now's a good time.
It won’t take long for such things if there’s a will, Sipilä wrote.
The list published last week by the Government has, among other things, the conversion of the final and helatorsta into unpaid days without shortening the annual working hours.
In addition, the first days of illness are cut, overwork compensation is halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
Reforms will be implemented as mandatory legislation over trade unions, which has led to strong criticism.
As a result of the activities, the remuneration centre organisations organise a major demonstration on Friday, in addition to which several trade unions have declared political strikes.
Tohmajärvi Council approved the extension of the storage of the juice hall
The Tohmajärvi delegation unanimously approved the extension of the Nordic Koivu Oy Hall, which is a bit of a minor.
The fact is that the project is bigger and more expensive than it was originally mentioned.
Also a busy schedule badly.
It was also a little wonder that the subscription was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of the stock between 400 and 450 square metres was approved in the Investment Programme, but the funding will be decided more closely in the context of the Interim Report.
A further item on the agenda was the EUR 150 000-200 000 investment, but the technical manager Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the basis that it would bring work and tax revenues to the location.
The municipality does not have a risk, as the company pays the investment as a rental, Vesa Väistö (ps.) justified.
Karelian Language Location in Joensuu
The city government reduced its former sharp position to bring the street signs of the Cattle language to the city centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right to preserve the tradition of livestock throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of the Karelian language, because there are no historical grounds for it and the language of the herd is not an inherent part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the region of Joensuu has been more part of the eastern savoi fractures.
After a new decision, there will be no street names signs in the city centre.
However, the City of Joensuu is, on a case-by-case basis, prepared to use the Karelian language, for example, in the information boards and marketing of tourism.
The same attitude is recommended for all other actors.
Even though Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, it is also worth taking a spacious approach to the use of the Cattle language now that multiculturalism lives and changes heavily in Northern Karelia.
Karelian language is still a special feature of the county, as well as an image of Joensuu as the entire forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can benefit from a wide range of marketing in the county.
Stopping train connections cut the country's vitality
The cuts of train connections hit the country's vitality with a hard hand.
Transport connections directly affect the economy and competitiveness of the county.
And it affects whether we can live and work here, the Mayor of Joensuu, Kari Karjalainen, wonders.
He also points out air transport, which has also been carried out several times in the report.
For the whole country, it is important that we do not have the opportunity to reduce by the measures of government, as is now the case.
The effects of these transport connections on employment should be considered, for example, by Karjalainen.
The deterioration of transport connections causes an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here are, such as transport connections and housing situation, the easier it is to get students and employees, Jukka Mönkkönen, head of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor transport connections also affect the faculty, which is highly mobile and travels a lot because of the study.
Marko Junkkarinen, Chief of Recruitment, says that it is already difficult to market the university towards Western Finland, because the connections are weak in the direction of the difference.
Currently about half of students from the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
On the other hand, around 10-20 per cent of them are from New Zealand, partly explained by direct train connection.
Joensuu became one of my sororities at the Siu War
The views of the City Government of Joensuu on the region's Siu war project are apparently unanimous, but one of my sornal voices is among them.
Member of the City Government Pentti Central (sd., in the picture) presented the Government’s Monday meeting to give up the entire project, but his presentation fell unprofitable.
The Government approved the Kari Karjalainen decision-making proposal, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will give a final opinion on the project at the same time with all the other municipalities.
One train from Kotka to Kouvola will end next year
Traffic in passenger trains from Kotka to Kouvola will continue in the future, although one train line will be less frequent.
There will be changes in passenger transport between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One train pair will be left out, but five more times a day, Kouvola will enter Kouvola from Kotka and vice versa.
The reduction is due to state savings.
The purchase of the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four years will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely terminated.
VR will prepare new schedules by the end of the year.
They will enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed on the roof, one didn't get down, the guys were out of place.
The rescue facility lets a 12-year-old climb from the roof, who couldn’t get down the roof with his own help.
The situation was born in Tornion Hill on Ketotie on Tuesday night at 6:30 p.m.
There is an old two-storey wooden house where there are no ladders on the roof.
It did not prevent a boy group who decided to climb the house to the roof along the mass of the radio amateurs next to it.
The other boys got the same route down, but one didn't.
As a result, the rest of the people lived from the place and the passers were alerting the rescue facility to help the pulleys safely return to the surface of the earth.
FedEx’s operating profit is dubious, lowers the tax year’s 2016 outlook
FedEx reports depressing results in the last quarter, and the delivery waste cut the entire year’s forecast, as a result of reduced demand for freight services and higher costs for its land services.
The company also said it was going to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
Last year, FedEx announced that it was hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
Its share decreased by about 2.5 per cent in the opening auction 45 minutes before the opening watch of the Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. says it expects the end of the tax year next May to result in $10.40-10.90, which is 20 cent lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, tell us about FactSet's survey.
The smaller outlooks, despite the average price increases of 4.9%, entered into force on January 4 and despite the higher surcharges that began in November for heavy or large packages of land transport.
The company said it expects the business profit to grow from the previous year, because they have cut costs, the turnover has increased and the online trade is growing.
The president and CEO, Fred Smith, said that the company will be stable, taking into account the weaker economic conditions expected, in particular in production and global trade.
The plans for wages during the holiday were announced on the day after the competitor UPS announced that he was going to hire 90-95,000 extra-workers, about the same as it hired last year.
In the 31st quarter of August, FedEx's result was $692 million, which is 6% more than last year.
The profit per share came to $2.42, which remains from the average forecast of $2.44. The 12 analysts survey carried out by Zacks Investment Research.
Net sales rose by 5% to $12.3 billion.
In Zack's survey, six analysts expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered a decrease in international priority transport in recent years, which has stopped the development of its Express unit’s turnover.
However, the rise in the online store has improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the net sales of land units rose by 29 per cent, but in principle, the revenues of operations were the same because of the expensive costs of larger packages and their own insurance.
The revenues of the Express unit were better due to higher basic payments, while higher labour costs were reduced by operating profit in freight operations.
At the opening auction, around an hour before the opening watch FedEx’s shares fell to $3.85, or 2.5 percent to $15.15.
FedEx closed on Tuesday 11 per cent in the fall for this year and 17 per cent in the record of 11 June.
This week, the U.S. Central Bank’s decision-makers will sit around the huge mahogany table for two days to decide whether the time has come to raise the control rate for the first time for nearly a decade.
In the second from the central bank, a two-storey meeting room is a wall painting from the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank Janet L. Yellen and his colleagues must put the financial interests of the nation ahead of everything else.
Congress has placed two responsibilities on the central bank: they must maximize the employment of the United States and keep prices stable.
However, since the Great Depression, the central bank leaders have accepted that there is also a third non-written mandate: economic stability.
It is precisely this third requirement that can be a decisive factor in a decision to be published on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted.
Although most of the data show a steady growth in the economy, the recent trend in the global financial markets may have already made pre-supervised central bank officials more alarming about increasing instability. It is feared how it would be affected if the federal fund rates were raised even in the quarter of the percentage point.
\"I understand that labour market and inflation are the first and most important aspects to be followed,\" Lindsey M. Piegza said, a major economic expert at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“I believe, however, that if they are looking for a justification for a return to interest rates, the increased uncertainty on the world market is a valid reason to wait yet, he says.
The decision of the central bank has not reached an agreement, which is already creating a nervousness for the economy.
According to Bloomberg's recent study, about half of economic experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
On the other hand, the financial market expects the central bank to delay the rise, as the key indicator shows that there is only about 30% chance of growth.
This suggests a fall in the securities market if the central bank raises the level, unless the decision-makers manage to mitigate the impact by promising that the next increase will not take place in the near future.
Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average index rose to 228.89 points, i.e. 1.4 percent, while the new chapter was 16599.85.
The recovery came with the expectation that the central bank would keep its level unchanged this week, says John Lonski, a major economist at the Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
“It’s surprising if the central bank raises interest right now,” he said.
If the decision-makers raise interest rates, they need to see a lot of effort in their orientation to support the financial market so that they do not panic.
Other experts claim that the elevated level would calm the financial market because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the central bank will operate.
Only a month ago, it seemed that the central bank would be raising the interest rate by a quarter percentage point this month, so taking the first small step towards slow tightening of the monetary economy, which would ensure the stability of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen has stated in spring and early spring that he expects the level to rise this year, despite the fact that liberals demand more economic development in their complaints.
Although the creation of new jobs slowed down in August, the growth of the labour market has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent in the last month, which is the lowest number of seven years and close to the level that the central bank considers to be the limit of full employment.
The increase in wages has shown signs of piracy.
Although inflation is still under the annual goal of 2% of the central bank, the central bank’s decision-makers say that access to this is significantly reduced by the temporary impact of oil prices.
Economics – to clarify even higher interest rates and also needs them in view of the tight labour market situation – says Ian Shepherdson, the chief economic expert of the Pantheon Macroeconomics company.
However, the financial markets around the world were shaken last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index decreased by up to 16 per cent of its Mayan record, when investors feared China’s slowing economy would also slow down global growth.
The markets have recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now nearly 10% below the peak in May.
For the decision-makers of the central bank, market mystery is an additional factor in a complex equation, which tells us that interest rates should be increased.
“Without these financial market events and recent weeks of news on the weakness of the Chinese economy, decision-makers would tighten the level at this meeting,” says Stephen D. Oliner, a specialist researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, and former central bank official.
Now he predicts that the decision-makers expect at least a month to gain a better understanding of the effects.
“The potential impact on the US economy is still quite unclear, and they have little information in their use as regards the consequences of the events in China,” says Oliner.
The welfare of the international economy is not the main concern of the central bank, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Central Bank has become the world’s monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been immense.
In 2013, the president, Ben S. Bernanken, suggested that the central bank could – narrowly – increase the amount of money, caused market shocks around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly concentrated, central bank officials are expected not only to develop elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the world economy.
The central bank’s decision-making process is more art than science, says Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy of the asset management company Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank (Federal Reserve Bank) in Richmond, Virginia, said this month that the central bank has previously overreacted its financial market movement, which has seemed to be separate from the fundamentals of the economy.
The Federal Open Market Committee has called for an increase in interest, and Lacker, a member of the Committee entitled to vote, calls for an example in the 1998-99 decisions.
The Asian economic crisis caused the central bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 per cent during the three meetings – despite its limited, recognizable effects on US economic growth – Lacker says.
A year later, the central bank canceled these cuts.
The central bank should give priority to economic stability only during a major crisis, as the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, former member of the Central Bank of England (Bank of England).
The last millerry doesn’t come close to its level, Posen says.
“No one wants a situation in which the rise in interest rates is feared because the market is getting upset,” said Posen, chairman of the Peterson Institute for International Economics Institute.
The Federal Reserve Act still maintains a dual requirement and does not mention economic stability, as long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

The Brazilian Child Health Organization Rio Grande advertises a healthy diet for infants
The Brazilian Child Health Organization SPRS has invented a shocking way of trying to make women understand the importance of good nutrition during the nursing period by publishing photos of babies sucking breasts with painted descriptions of unhealthy food.
Breast-feeding consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients necessary for the development of a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that adding calorie amounts is not the only dietary change that mothers should make.
The recent study led by Professor Robert Waterland at Baylor College of Medicine revealed that the healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genetic manifestation of their babies and protects babies from tumor development.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the child’s immune system.
The Seven Channel Sunrise program is popular in viewers, despite the efforts of the Nine Channel to announce leadership in the Today Show program
Karl Stefanovic's and Lisa Wilkinson's attack on Canberra's news of the last novelties of the Liberal Party failed to increase Today's viewers.
The morning program of the Nine Channel was sent from the capital of the country after Malcolm Turnbull was forced out of power by Tony Abbott.
The racing program Sunrise, which is run by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of the week’s sustainable series of international broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The pressure of the distance did not seem to be detrimental to Australian TV viewers, as the average value of Sunrise’s viewers was 397,000 in five state capitals when Today’s number was 339,000.
The average of Today slightly rose from Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000) figures, but it was still lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has caught Sunrise in recent months.
In August, the average of Today was 318,000 and Sunrisen 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference ranged between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
During September, the Sunrise average is 349,000 viewers, with today’s figure of 314,000.
This is the most interesting event all morning.
Changes in the winds will blow up this morning as well as in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
Published by TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
The great news of the Seven Channel was the 800-word series, featuring the former Packed to the Rafters series star Erik Thomson, an amazing first performance.
The new drama series, which gathered a very impressive average of 1.219 million viewers, tells about a recently widowed father who decides to move to the New Zealand coast with his two children.
Criticians have wondered if Thomson was the most popular force of the series alone without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave this real certainty.
The Seven Channel The X Factory was a strong favourite with its 1.136 million viewers, easily winning the Block Series (838,000) and the TBL Families (726,000).
Seven channels had a dubious fate on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17-17.30) of Andrew O'Keefe's new visualization program was gathered by 446,000 viewers in the mid-March.
The second half-hour (17.30-18) rose to 623,000 viewers – which was enough to win the little victory of Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia’s first half-hour viewer average was 520,000 viewers, and the second half-hour number was about 720,000.
The Hot Sett average was 620,000.
The Chase Australia’s second-night viewer’s decrease in mean value brings confidence to the Nine Channel that the Hot Sea will eventually become the most popular program at 17.30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute program, which failed to reduce the number of viewers on the McGuir program.

The final triangle agrees with Dad that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
The secret is revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski could accidentally reveal who won the Bachelor series.
The identity of this woman has been kept extremely secret with which Sam Wood ends up in The Bachelor.
Three of the remaining girls really don't slip who got the last rose.
However, when we discussed Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoskin and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before the three became two, they could, however, unintentionally give a hint of the winner's identity.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's final.
All three women were thrown into poetry when they said that Wood was the perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, ambition, family dignity and positiveness as a reason why they wanted to be his partner.
But when they were asked, \"If Wood's last rose is not for you, to whom it should go, their answer might have been to offer a revelation of who won the boy's heart.
Both Jeavons-Flows and Markoski quickly mentioned Mackay as the best choice for Wood after them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been uncomplicated since the first day.
“From that moment on, when I walked into the house, the energies and the energies of Sam seemed quite compatible, and that thought was in my mind throughout the series,” Jeavons-Flows said.
\"Sarah is really close to the ground, it's fun to be with him,\" Markoski added.
I've seen them together and there's chemistry between them.
They seem comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would fit very well.
Mackay said that last week's home visits made him realize that Wood could be the right one.
“When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game – I am now with my whole heart here,” he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if he didn't, Mackay was invaluable.
\"I don't know if I can say,\" he said.
I like the remaining girls as much, so it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be sent on Wednesday at 7.30 a.m. on the Ten Channel.

Jarryd Hayne has many options to start his NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both very interested in her change to the United States, and many other teams have been asking about her after her impressive open day of training at the end of last year.
Hayne, however, chose the San Francisco 49ers team and coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coachs would have left Hayne on the exchange bench for the end of the game after this Australian rugbyliga turned down the ball to return to the team when they won the team on Tuesday at 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and allowed Haynen to return the next plane kick and took him to the run after the injury of Reggie Bush.
The true character of Tomsula was also seen in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of knocking on his new recruits in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at a post-game press conference.
The 49ers special editor Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped the plane that Minnesota Vikings caught in the first quarter of the game
This really wasn’t the beginning Hayne and his many Australian fans were hoping for a man’s NFL-debyyt.
Haynen was seen as a curse on the road after the fall, and later he told the Australian radio pairer Hamish & Andy on the 2DayFM channel with a frequency of 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start for his NFL career.
“It’s just one of these things, all you have to do is think about the next game, and that’s it,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared his 2007 Origin debut when the input in his own target area led to the Queensland goal.
Overall, it was a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posted his Instagram account in a photo with fans, holding the Australian ticket.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights

Hodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted of being confiscated by his oil company Yukos and his efforts to support democracy were restricted.
4 killed by police shooting rubbers against protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old son, died in the southern Nepal police shooting rubbers in a crowd that showed their mind against the new constitutional proposal of the country, the official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in the district of Rwanda, about 175 miles from the western capital of Katmandus.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the chief official of the area, said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, and some of them threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot the air before resorting to rubber bags.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he told me.
It was not immediately clear why rubberoids, known to have been killed, but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, seemed to have caused so many deaths.
The summary was in the last weeks of violent protests across Nepal, where members of the ethnic group called Madhesi said that the new provinces established under the proposed new constitution undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in Western Nepal when the Tharus Group calls for its own state.
Since the 10th of August, at least 40 people have died in violent confrontations, 11 of which have been police officers.
At that time, four main parties signed an agreement that divided the country into provinces - a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been the central government for centuries.
The new constitution has been planned since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
This week, the legislators have voted on the Constitutional Statements of Katmandus, and the authorities have said that the new Charter has been approved by Sunday.

Google launches a donation campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) released a donation campaign aimed at collecting 11 million dollars for humanitarian organizations helping thousands of refugees who have come to Europe in their escape from war and poor countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal perspective in its published donation campaign blog.
Instead of making the announcement, his personal experience was written by Google employee Rita Masoud, who fled at the age of seven with his family from Kabul.
“Our journey included many dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, coldness and darkness,” he wrote.
I was lucky.
But when the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family desperately want to help.
Donations are awarded to four non-profit organizations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google reported that it would be responsible for the same amount of donations made on every Google.com/refugeereef website worldwide up to $5.5 million, with a total target of $11 million.
The worst refugee crisis in Europe has since been in the Second World War and is mainly due to the four years of Syrian civil war, which has led more than 4 million people out of their homes this year.
Many also flee war-during Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss can help moderately over-fat diabetics
According to a new study, the benefits of mildly overweight type 2 diabetics from weight loss can last at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics live longer after weight loss than those treated in other ways than surgery.
“For a long time, Dr. Robin Blackstone says he’s a weight loss expert who wrote a new study in JAMA Surgery.
In weight loss or bariatric surgery, different methods are used to reduce the size of the abdominal bag.
They reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric cuts have been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the subjects involved in the study have been sickly obese, and their body mass index (BMI) has been 35 or more.
BMI, i.e. the ratio of weight to length, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If BMI is over 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if a person’s BMI is over 30, he is considered to be obese.
You can count your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new research, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used the data collected from 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric surgery, and gastric surgery, the treatment of type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of the subjects cut from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, people who were treated by other means than surgery remained the same in 29 BMI.
Of the subjects cut, 36% of the diabetes was completely improved and 28% partially.
Due to comparison, in a medically treated group, diabetes was completely improved by only 1% and in part by about 2%.
In addition, the blood pressure, triglycerides, as well as, unfortunately, the LDL-cholestor, generally, were better in the cutting group, the authors said.
Researchers also monitored the blood haemoglobin levels of patients reflecting blood sugar levels in the long term.
The haemoglobin value of A1c should remain below 7%, researchers write.
After surgery, the haemoglobin level of A1c dropped from approximately 9% to about 6%.
However, in the treatment group, it remained stable in about 8%.
However, this improved-glycic control, described by improved haemoglobin levels of A1c, did not reduce mortality in five years, says Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu, a major researcher, along with colleagues.
The study group also compared the average results between two different types of surgery.
For the fifth year, when compared to the group in the gastric surgery, the group had dropped more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), decreased more (7.4 and 5.1), decreased the haemoglobin levels of A1c (3.1 % and 2.1 %), and had more likely to achieve a total diabetes release (46.9 % and 16.7%).
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix, Blackstone, says that although the study does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden, where the surgery led to a longer life for more serious people.
A Swedish study found that obesity patients undergoing weight loss had 29% lower chances of dying during the 15-year period when compared to a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
Although a new study does not show an improvement in the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says, however, that the results are encouraging for people with BMI less than 35 and interested in surgery.
“The results of the study are crucial in showing that the surgery is safe for the lower body weight index, and does not involve an increased risk of death or kidney disease,” he said.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their physicians should take weight very seriously at the time the patient BMI is between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long before we take this seriously,” he says.
I believe that when a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, the withdrawal of the situation is very difficult.
“Everyone can’t come to Europe – Dalai Lama – RT News
Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that a real solution to the current refugee crisis can be found in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibet's Buddhism has called for the abolition of violence in the refugee countries.
Dalai Lama dealt with the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech, which he held at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the beginning of his ten-day visit to Britain.
Dalai Lama claimed that, in the present situation, the needs of all mankind should be put ahead of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that although the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis must be admired, it is also insufficient.
“Everyone can’t come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria for their efforts in the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
“It’s wonderful to take care of thousands of refugees, but in the meantime we have to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslims, mainly through education.
The most basic thing is to think about how we can reduce killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
Power usage has never solved these problems, he added.
When it comes to the question of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the violent response of the United States caused violent events in the chain.
“After 9/11, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem could be found through violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used strength and it created unexpected consequences,\" Dalai Lama said.
During the last four years, swallowing children's hand disinfectant has increased to four times.
Toxic data centers across the United States have reported an increase of nearly 400% in the number of children under the age of 12, according to Georgia’s poison data center.
According to the director of the Georgia Poison Information Centre, according to the doctor Gaylord Lopez, cases of immersion of disinfectant in children under the age of 12 rose from 2010 3266 to 2014 16117.
“The children are more interested in these products and unfortunately a certain percentage of them are to the emergency police,” Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant intentionally, while some want to impress their friends or respond to the challenge on social media.
On YouTube, there are videos where teens drink disinfectant to get a cheap pickup.
According to reports, teens have mixed disinfectant with alcohol in mouth water to get a stronger drink.
The scents of a pleasant disinfectant can attract younger children.
\"The child doesn't think this is bad for him,\" Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (manifest) are those that have been added to the fragrance.
There are strawberries, grapes and orange-based disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
A hand disinfectant may contain alcohol between 45 % and 95 %.
In particular, in small children, only a few injections are needed for alcohol poisoning.
\"It's a really concentrated alcohol,\" said Mr. Stephen Thornton, head of the University of Kansas Medical Center for Poisoning Intelligence, who told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave the whiskey shot at the table, but the hand-desining agent is left visible, and if the kids are interested in it, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhajah Russell is a six-year-old girl who, for some time, swallowed only four injection strawberries in the hands of disinfectant in the school, and was taken to the first aid.
His blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice as high as the adult wheel drink limit, says Chris Ritchey, a first-aid doctor at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah, when speaking with your father, was unable to walk when he arrived at first aid.
Doctors followed him overnight at a separate children's hospital for possible brain injuries, because alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.
\"It was really scary,\" Nhaijah's mother Ortoria Scott told CNN.
The situation could have been deadly to my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and move the disinfectant away from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants are associated with deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a hand disinfectant containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
Health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was reported as an active ingredient.
In January, in the northern part of New York State, three fourth-class designers designed to poison their \"silver\", by spreading bacteria to the classroom, reported in the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to the disinfection material of his hands and denied it in his class.
The police need to prevent the plan as a flexible nonsense and leave disciplinary action within the school district.

The former Rangers midfield player and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition for the championship with Rangers.
Ajax’s current Ambassador de Boer said: “The Netherlands will no longer show the highlights of Celtic games and why –
Because Rangers isn't involved.
People here can't just talk about Rangers' return.
They're talking about the Old Firm teams.
They're talking about both teams together, and they're interested in it.
The games of these teams have a lot of tensions, as well as non-Scotlands want to follow those games.
Deila swears to turn around the situation
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss swears to turn around the situation.
The loss to Malmö and the result of the fall of the Master's League was quickly followed by a loss of ten men to Aberdeen, which is now at the top of the series with a difference of five points to the next.
But Deila said, “Celtic has had bad episodes before, and we will rise again.
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what happens.
We are, too, but we have to keep going.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton
Although Rangers boss Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on possible targets for January’s transfer of players, he is prepared for the most recruiting, ensuring that he does not want to confuse the team with consensus.
The former Brentford boss said: “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.
In the case of future players in the summer, the adjustment time is the time before the whole time, which is reflected in our team this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes increasing unnecessary players can make more trouble.
Celtic's interest in Michu's retirement
Swansea's attacker, Michu, whose name is attached to Celtic, has suggested that he can retire after his contract with Swans ends.
A 29-year-old player has had a wart plan for two years and was unable to find a new follow-up outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts is ready to fight the Scottish Football League because of Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team lost 3-2 after this. The party red card was later canceled, and this was already the third red card convicted by Collum in the last eight months.
Neilson remains behind his message, saying: “I didn’t question honesty, I didn’t comment on the performance.
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The faithful Hibernian player was accused of letting him sing a offensive song from the former Hearts player Rudi Skaccel.
The incident occurred in the pub in Edinburgh Roseburn, before the Edinburgh derbya Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
“It was derby, and it was a moment of mood,” the attacker added, “It’s safe to say that I’m not going back to Tynecastle, unless I move to Celtic.”
Tannadice's government believes in Dundee United's leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that the government of Dundee United still believes in the leadership team’s ability to reverse the situation around, but admits that the loss of players must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're gonna get the boys back, Donnelly says.
McInnes is happy about winning – Hamilton
Derek McInnes admitted that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately involved in the game against Hamilton Accies, but succeeded by the first half-time penalty kick of Adam Rooney to reach his seventh consecutive league, which raised them at the top of the table five points above Celticia.
McInnes says: “There is no team that would have won anything, whether it was a boy or a league that would not have won the games in this way.
Scotland's unemployment remains the same as the UK's total
The unemployment rate in Scotland remained at 164,000 people between May and July, while unemployment in the UK as a whole increased by 1.82 million people.
Scotland's unemployment rate is 5.9 per cent higher than the UK's 5.5 per cent, according to the figures of the National Statistical Centre (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland decreased by 12,000 people over a three-month period, and the number of workers is now 2,612,000.
During the quarter, the employment rate of Scotland decreased to 74%, which is higher than the United Kingdom average by 73.5%.
The Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell commented on these latest figures: “The long-term plan for governance is to build a foundation for a stronger economy.
Almost a year has passed since Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the UK.
Over these 12 months, the Scottish labour market has improved, employment has increased and unemployment has decreased.
Why do I prove execution in Oklahoma?
If no legal intervention takes place, I will see it later today when a man is executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'm sitting on the viewers' newspaper at Oklahoma State Penitentiary Prison, watching Richard Glossip be executed with a deadly injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
I received the request in January through his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
I've started to be horrible this day as it approaches.
So why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Of course, suppliers have the opportunity to follow executions in America, and since applications are often more than free places, participants are selected through a terrible value.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of places dedicated to the media to twelve to five.
Anyone who chooses is looking at the event cool.
I can't do it.
I'm going to sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've also created my own contact with him through the calls made over the months and one two- and a half-hour visit.
I like the man.
We laugh often when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I can't have a notebook and a pen with me to save what I've seen.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
One of the Oklahoma journalists accused Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story in the way he wants you to participate.
I complained to the journalist.
He admitted that he could have put his word better, but he still believes that what I do is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of my words and things I have written.
He won't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do that if he said so.
I've told him he can remove me from his list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help the trend against the death penalty.
Huffington Post Reporter Kim Bellware is next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to the podcast broadcasts I made on the series.
I'm not going through all the details here again.
I can't say that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions following the murder of Barry Van Treese would, in any case, make him a victim of assistance.
But I think there's a very strong chance that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there wasn't enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And this is the point where I see him dying.
I can't say I'm totally impartial.
There will be other journalists who will take care of it.
You'll get a description of what it feels like to watch a man I like dies unnecessaryly.
The man was lured out of the Canning River River after a water police hunt.
The Canning Vale officer remained dry when he lured the man out of the Canning River.
A man from Perth was trying to confuse the police when he found himself in a low, muddy water only meters away from a police officer who tried to gently push him back to the beach.
The Canning Vale police were invited to Beckenham on Tuesday due to an unauthorized intrusion.
When they found the suspect, this tried to distract them by heading to the Canning River River.
But he didn't get too far.
\"He stood in the water, saying, \"I'm not coming out, come get me,\" said the senior chief officer Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec did not want his uniform to get baptized, so he used a safer tactic: \"A good police conference.
“Some people do funny things when they try to escape,” said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Master's Football player Ben Cousins is an interesting example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blow and tried to swim across the Swan River River.
He did not succeed in his business, but inspired the locals to start designing a playful Ben Cousins babyathlon.
Peter Moody claims that the contractors tried to spy on him and threaten to stop competing.
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria’s suppliers tried to infiltrate their losses last year, threatening to stop competing immediately.
He accuses agents and Racing Victoria's Independence Division, claiming that they have a personal campaign against him. On Wednesday, Lady Tatai's late rejection of the treatment measure on the day of the race was the last thread.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for competition, and that he has faced a difficult situation since Lidar’s unexplained positive cobalt sample.
He has kept his tongue under control for a period of one and a half years with regard to spy claims, and did not want it to look like envy.
“I wasn’t going to say anything about it, and I’ve been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so frustrated that everything gets broken down at once,” Moody said.
They knew the situation was going on.
Sometimes all I have to do is react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'm going home today and I'm going to sleep well.
I want to walk my head up and I want the owners to think that I'm doing my best in front of them.
When they begin to think differently, I must no longer continue as a coach.
Then I'd have to consider what I'm gonna do with my license.
In the past, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview with Racing.com, where he told me that the Independence Department had tried to spy on his stable.
\"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Doyle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart were sitting in the room with a man to name him when he asked, and offered him a job with my coat if he cared about what I'm doing there.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, they should be able to separate their lawyers, because they have failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of Racing Victoria, David Madie, current chairman of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Sanundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I begin to think this is becoming personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to become a man and perhaps to transfer responsibility to non-trainers about what is happening in the field?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I so harmful to the industry?
Maybe people think so.
Maybe they'll have to take my license and push me aside, and I don't think that's what I'm saying now that maybe they can think about it.
But I am now at the point that I don't care anymore, and it makes me sad.
It really makes me sad.
I'm trying to push them to make a decision that's their responsibility.
I have my family's support, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach’s frustration has increased with the long-term study of Lidar’s cobalt, and the late rejection made him realize that “it could throw his license over the table.”
Moody, the best known for the training of the undefeated master Black Caviar, has called the rules on the treatment of the race day to be ridiculed – since the mud or clay grave is placed on the feet of the horse, which is irregular.
“It’s against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it, he said.
One of my employees put it on his feet in a mistake.
It could have been a grave last night.
It could have been yesterday, just like it was.
It was on the day of the race.
Moody may be faced with a three-month ban on competition due to the race day’s grave treatment, from which the agents began the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about a horse.
“We all understand that the rules are needed, but this has gone too far,” Moody said.
In Cobram, a driver arrested for forced traffic
The police have arrested a man who committed a traffic escape after he hit a cyclist on a weekend in Cobram.
The biker was transported to the Royal Melbourne Hospital when he got serious injuries when the car hit him on Murray Valley's highway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver ran away and stopped to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Natalia reported to the police in Shepparton.
He will be accused of failing to stop in an accident, of neglecting assistance and other traffic violations.
A biker, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in hospital and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy attacks rivals in the push-ups
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticized the two NRL-rugbyligiga champions’ claims that his team's fights would be part of the line.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said that erotic judges allowed the Storm-pain on their own side when suddenly won the final play in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett was barely able to hide his reference to Storm after he won the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night in the final play. Bennett called the game a rugbyliga sample window, and said that two of the Queensland teams had not been – the toughest – the button.
Bellamy defended his team's fights and said they were just focused on the \"contact\" on the deck.
Bellamy added that her trust added two leading coach criticisms to Storm, because it means they are afraid to lose to the team.
“This always comes to mind – I didn’t hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we lost them 24 to 2, Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not exchanged anything in our defense systems or techniques throughout the year. In the last six weeks, we have only stressed contact in the fights, and it has made us successful.
Trent has been on the team for three years, and he's obviously got a great team to train, so he's probably not used to losing, so this was a little shock to him.
It's funny how it always gets to talk about this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of a forceful rugby by reminding his mentor that Bennett's coached St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing \"unfortunately\".
Wayne's talking about an exciting rugby.
He considered it important to compare Saturday night's game to our Friday night game and tell us how exciting their game was,\" Bellamy said.
I remember 2010 how St George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn’t care less.
But now he has a team that can play a rugby we consider exciting, especially when he has fast young friends.
You want to play a game like that when you have the kind of players you want to play.
He brought it up in 2010, now he wants everyone to play rugby in his style - not that team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play like that.
I will be more confident when they say such things because they are a little concerned about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think of us as a response to important games.
Bellamy also noted that the game between Storm and Roosters was more colorful than the game between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was definitely a good game, I haven’t looked at it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two goals more, but is it exciting rugby?
Or does it make it an exciting line of defense and not to make a goal?
It's about lines to me.
If they mention us, it means we can play against them somewhere.
Storm is free this weekend because they have already won the right to a home game either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharps for next Saturday night pre-final AAMI Park. Tickets will be sold next Tuesday morning.
Serb Man's $200,000 Warranty for Drugs
A man threatened by a possible life-long life-long 40 cocaine-pound possession company smuggled to Queensland has been released against the guarantee amount of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29-year-old, was one of five men arrested in the last month after the federal police had traced 100 kilos of drugs to Solay Hunt, who came to South America through the Vanuatu and was shipyardd in August to Comeera.
Maximovic was seen meeting the other accused in the boat harbour all morning, and after that he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where the police found 40 kilos of drugs in the Toyota Echo car.
Although Maksimovicia is threatening a possible life-long business-specific cocaine holding company, his lawyer claimed that there was no evidence that Maksimovic tried to keep the entire amount of its possession, and that he could have been at the cafe for completely innocent reasons.
The Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maximovic was trying to escape.
He has close links with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, he told me on Wednesday.
In the case of the Criminal Court, Maksimovic lied to the police about the place where he lived.
The mother and stepparents of Maximovic had offered a $200,000 guarantee to ensure his release.
\"After reading the evidence of both people, it is clear that the set of a guarantee of $200,000 is a real financial burden for them,\" Judge Flanagan said.
But alone, it was not enough to prevent him from appearing in court, he warned.
Maximovic was granted guarantees on the condition that he would hand over both Australia and Serbia's passport, to report daily to the police, and to stick to the ban on the outskirts between the evening and the morning.
Stevan Hogg used her phone to attract pedophiles to send pictures
The pedophile used a 11-year-old girl's phone when asking for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took this phone while sleeping, and then entered the online communications service, where Hogg received numerous unsolicited images of the children that the other user sent to him.
The girl woke up later, found that the phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
The girl looked at her phone and found shocking messages, and she immediately told her mother.
When the police came to see five photos, investigate the computers on the premises, and find the \"deprived\" web searches using search probes that had been used to search for pictures of the child's unsuspected images.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this to pedophile on the internet before he would show himself to be a police officer to scare them.
Fiscal depute, Eilith Robertson, told the Dundeen Sheriff Court: “He said it’s an addiction that he is dependent on the fear of people.
He admitted that he had completed his searches on the computer but said they were only made because he wanted to pretend to be a cop so that he could scare pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with an unknown person who sent him pictures and when Hogg asked the person to send additional pictures.
Hogg said he did this just for bait purposes.
He said that after drinking, he is sick and wants to look at pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: “When the girl found the pictures of her phone, she screamed at her mother, she was shaking and crying.
My mother saw the pictures on the phone, and then she met the accused.
The girl was interviewed, and she said the accused had used a computer and a PlayStation to talk to the girls who looked younger.
The 23-year-old Hogg, who lives on Ward Road Dundee, admitted his guilt for the production or taking of pictures of unauthorised children on 14 June last year. He broke his bail on January 25th of this year and failed to come to trial on March 24th of this year.
Defender Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be included in the register of sexual offenders, as it may be argued that he had not been involved in the crime – an indication of sexual elements –
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the sentence to October, so that social action has time to prepare background reports.
Hogg was granted guarantees in this case, but in other ongoing cases he was arrested before the trial.
He was added to the register of sexual offenders before the date of judgment.
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe gave the wrong speech to Parliament
Earlier this year, Mugabe, the oldest president of Africa, fell on the leading stairs of the speaker.
He did not hurt, but the video described as the crash spread through social media like the virus.
Parliament’s opening statements were also made by opposition legislators that they had been sent anonymous killing threats, which warned them not to rush to Mugabe during his speech.
In the last month, they bashed and interrupted him in the interlocutors when he held a speech on the state of the earth to Parliament, which he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) group supervisor Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians had received text messages to their mobile phones that warned them not to interfere with Mugabe’s speech.
\"The number from which the message was sent is not answered, but the message title is \"death\",\" Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned the relevant members that immunity would end in Parliament, and when they came out, parliamentary immunity would not be in force.
The group supervisor said that the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is, in its concerns, a threat to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut 25 000-30 000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost cutting efforts in the business service business.
Later this year, HP is divided into two listed companies, distinguishing their computer and printer business from faster growing business equipment and services.
The expected job cuts bring around $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, the HP release said.
\"These restructuring measures enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,\" said Meg Whitman, the president and CEO of HP, which leads the unit after division.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than today’s-HP, and we will have a wide range of services that will help companies move to new business,” Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to respond to the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s annual turnover will be more than $50 billion, and it will focus on producing unparalleled integrated technology solutions – for companies, the company’s information.
The division breaks down the company that Bill Hewlett, who graduated from Stanford University, and Dave Packard, founded in the 1930s to produce electrical equipment. The company operated in a garage in Palo Alto, which is called the “Pai Valley Place of Birth”
HP has gone through a huge restructuring to find out about the transition from traditional computer to mobile devices.
HP is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, and its distribution is the latest sector based on the belief that strictly limited companies are performing better.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must support the injured Jack Wilshere before the Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is only until September and assuming that he is going to be on the run according to plans, there is no reason why he would not be playing again by Christmas.
In this best case, Wilshire will miss at least four of the next English games, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will participate in the European Championship next summer.
The greatest pity in this recent problem is that the end of the last season of Wilshere was strong after a single wart, and he remembered his old sharpness before the beginning of the season.
\"This kind of disability doesn't threaten a career,\" Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's not weird.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries he has had.
This can be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted, the player trying to return through the middle is always at the risk of additional injuries.
There is also an uncomfortable model.
Research by Premier Injuries Ltd shows that Wilsher had 23 different injuries after he debuted six years ago.
In addition, during the last five years, he has played only 65 games of Arsenal 157 league.
In view of Arsenal’s wider overall after the period 2007-08, in six out of eight, it has been one of the Valolioliiga teams that have lost the most days due to the injury.
Wenger admits the opportunity of a witch, but Arsenal believes that their last-year improvement in disability statistics will continue.
“The skill when returning from the injury can be an alkaline period when you need to strengthen your body and get a competition,” Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body will stabilize, I am sure that it will happen, and that he will have a career as he deserves.
Wenger prepares to recycle his team when Arsenal starts his Champions League game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, playing after that on Saturday in Chelsea and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be on the initiative.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud's Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to maintain balance and give a breathtaking break to the players who need it,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear sequel to the F-block, the Maksmir Stadium Zagreb is the scariest in Europe.
In addition, Dinamo has not lost 41 games since they produced their own “Undefeated” campaign in the last season.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday by an earthquake, which was 3.2 on Richter's scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has taken the lesson of the surrender of the last season's Champions League against Monaco, and is still motivated by a distant dream to lead the team to its first European Cup.
\"This motivation is huge,\" Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but I can be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about male friendship
It is striking how similar descriptions are not in series, especially considering that men’s need for opening up is more desperate than ever, and young men’s suicide rates are higher than in fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the largest cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK and is three times more common in men than in women.
In the attempt to tackle the problem of Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 for men, the goal was to challenge a culture that prevented men from seeking help when needed.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
In a recent study, there were more than 2,000 upper secondary and secondary school students who showed signs of depression. According to a study, the possibility of a person to recover doubled if a high enough percentage of his friends were – healthy –
Similarly, those who were not depressed had the likelihood of experiencing possible mental health problems if they had healthy friends.
But in order for friendship to work, it must be available first.
In this social media through communication time the style goes past content, and the answer to the indifference is often more important than the relevant contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need for strong, joyful and successful, although in reality isolation is controlled.
The values of this surface success, which psychologists call external: money, imago, social status. All this happens to internal values - the inner longing for personal growth and friendship - at the expense of a deeper mental health.
And as the billionaire video game developer has recently explained, money does not really get a bigger happiness.
The fineness of the Frends was that it turned this focus into the main law.
No character was defined by their work, but rather by their personality, which was clearly distinguished in interaction as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in their comfortable chairs watching football, Ross miss Rachel - these humors became aware that yes, men can identify with this all, even though they often hesitate to fully explore their feelings.
As the Samaritans volunteer worker explained to me: “When I listen to people who are depressed and self-destructive, I have really understood how the smallest interaction with a friend can improve the feeling of being.
People often contact us feel that they can’t talk to friends.
The old idea of getting over is strong, as well as feeling that if you open up problems, you will be seen as weak.
Frendit is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term survival methods.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
Although my impartial, external position at the other end of the phone helps people in desperate moments, long-term support comes from a close, personal family and friends network.
And then if you attend Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend, and all the pictures are redesigned to celebrate the celebration, why don't you take your friends to the coffee at Central Perk.
Or, even better if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Frends are sent to Comedy Central from the beginning to the end, all 236 episodes, attend #FriendsFest
Di Maria makes a goal and helps PSG to vacate Malmö to the side
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan the paintings against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored a goal in the Champions League debut, helping the PSG to bypass the Swedish team in Malmö on Tuesday.
Below the match report and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started his Champions League game with a nice 2-0 win against Malmö in Parc des Princess on Tuesday.
Di Maria made the Master's League debut with a goal of less than four minutes pointing to the French league champions on the road, but the team lost several chances before finally added their lead in Cavan's attack on the 61st minute goal.
Paris, which is in the same section of the A, with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetski, needed a strong start against the Swedish champion, for the game did not only have a sequel, but also a cure for their quarter-final-leading games in the last three rounds.
But even though PSG took the points, it wasn't a classic game, because Laurent Blanc's team Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the spot in front of the goal and later switched from the field. Malmö is his old hometown team and it's the team where he started his great career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win in the Champions League at home or in the guest, so the 2-0 victory brings problems to the opponent and looks good in statistics, and it’s a good start, although there are things we have to do this season,” Blanc said.
This is a good one.
We wanted to win and win, even though I'm afraid we didn't succeed in making one or two more goals.
After the injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team for one of the three changes since the team was left in the 2-2 game in Ligue 1's home game against Bordeaux on the weekend, but remained in the fourth minute under Di Maria's shadow.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentine Panzer was named a man who takes the PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why he ran the Marco Verratt's feed behind Malmö's defense line and then hit the beautiful finish by Johan Wiland on the back corner of the network.
However, if someone expected the PSG to be easy and big, he was disappointed.
Malmö was a blocked opponent, and won the Celtic in a solution to this level, with nine international players and five-man defenses and two players deep in the middle field.
But the team did not offer much more than a shot at Nikola Djurdjic in the 34th minute, which passed the button by Kevin Trapp's paint rod.
Instead, PSG was sometimes in trouble due to lost input and poor finishing, especially from Ibrahimovic, which failed in total in five companies only in the first half of the year and then disappointed when Cavani put the ball in from contact with Ibrahimovic immediately in the beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more effective when he first worked with his colleagues, and just after Ibrahimovic's feed, Di Maria sent a tour of the spiral kick that tilted around the Wiland's paint rod at 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally won after an hour of the game, thanks to the sixth goal of the season by the French Cavan, after Ibrahimovic had pinched the Maxwell Crusade from the left.
This ended Malmö’s hopes of getting back to the game, and only the brilliant struggle of Wiland with the direct kick of David Luiz kept the final numbers down until the Ezequiel Lavezz’s goal was completely rejected at the end of the game.
Malmö’s coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was as high as his team. Norwegian said: “Our last championship league game was in December of last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
Car racing is not enough.
I'll pick up the hat for Paris.
This was a great game from them.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion for the sale of shares
In Switzerland, the mining industry left Glencore, which suffered from a price drop in the basic goods, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its extensive debt cut-off plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, reported that it had sold new shares to reduce its debt by around £1.6 billion.
The company, which lost 57% of its market value this year, struggles with the prices of degraded basic goods, while the slowdown in the Chinese economy burdens demand and causes damage to all markets.
The brand was added to Glencore’s shares at the top of the London Stock Exchange in the morning.
The shares rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 in the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore had unveiled the $2.5 billion share trading last week as part of its broader plan to cut its $30 billion debt burden by about a third.
The company sold new share capital with 125 penny shares, which meant a 2.4% discount on Tuesday’s final price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares with a total value of 9.99% of the group.
The long-standing growth in China has been cut by around half of the prices of iron ore, while the prices of coal, copper and other commodities have decreased by 20-40 per cent.
White House Strengthens Xi Jinping's Visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping makes a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, confirmed in the White House’s statement on Tuesday.
X's first official visit to Washington takes place on 25 September and is the answer to President Barack Obama's last visit to Beijing, the statement said.
US President Michelle Obama and his wife will arrange for X and his spouse Peng Liyuan for dinner after the leaders have held bilateral negotiations.
“The visit of Mr X allows us to expand cooperation between the United States and China in a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while at the same time giving President Obama and President X the opportunity to talk constructively about issues where there are differences, the resolution was added.
At a visit that was announced for the first time in February, Xin is also expected to deviate from Seattle on his way to Washington to meet numerous U.S. technology leaders before continuing towards New York City and the UN General Assembly of September.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington’s concern regarding China’s alleged cybersecurity and the country’s increased condition in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon minimizes the difference in filming
Matt Damon joined the African American filmmaker Effie Brown when they discussed the difference that Damon said was not needed behind the scenes.
During the HBO Sunday Night Project Greenlight episode, the actor interrupted Brown when highlighting the need for a variety of perspectives as to the dark-looking main character of the script selected for the project.
\"When we talk about the difference, it takes into account when choosing actors in the film, not in the series,\" Damon said.
Confounded Brown responded unbelievingly, comments from “Oh! Wow. Okay, while the comments of the Martian actor remained hanging in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finalists of the series.
“I want people to think, whoever the director is, how they treat Harmony’s personal character,” Brown said.
The only dark figure is a whore that's hit by his white pimp.
The Dear White People producer demanded that the film be directed by the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon responded to the fact that their guidance could end up giving us something we do not want.
When the debate was sent, the social media exploded to the point of Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPoon expressed his anger at the film clip, writing: “Matt Damon talking about the only dark-sex person in the room and explaining to him the difference is from NIIN’s WORD that happens.
The Twitting collected more than 5000 retwitting and 4000 likes after its publication.
Damon’s comments hit the time when the exact racial presentation in the media is in the front of the social debate.
After the White Police killed Teen Michael Brown in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement spread to land and called on the legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, the singer Prince referred to the year album candidates as the winner of the Grammy Award.
“Albume still matters,” he said.
As with books and black lives, albums are still important.
The leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement recently published an opinion in response to the question of whether the group should be considered a hate group.
\"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group,\" the leaders said.
It was said that Damon was involved in this group of entertainers, producers, and mediamogues invited to visit the Pope to discuss the picture of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope.
The First American Ninja Warrior
As a professional player and collector of dishes, Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete on Monday to win the American Ninja Warrior competition and received a $1 million prize.
There has never been a competitor in the competition program, which has just ended its seventh season, which would have been clear of all the shares of the program's barrier track.
In the last section of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, survived the final round.
The last task had to climb about 23 meters of rope in 30 seconds.
Britten first climbed and solved the challenge in his time, making him the first athlete ever to figure out the exhausting 4th part of American Ninja Warrior. Caldiero, however, solved the challenge three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after a difficult victory and was still in shock for winning the million-dollar main prize.
“It’s amazing to think about this when I’ve never earned or lived like I’ve lived for a maximum of $10,000 a year,” Isaac told E! after his big raise.
So suddenly... I can't even imagine what this will be like... the future is unknown.
Production Manager Kent Weed sat down to talk to The Hollywood Reporter about the nuances and why Britten won’t get more reward money, even though he’s the first competitor ever to get through the track.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
“If more people pass, the money gets the one who has the fastest time,” Weed said.
Although money is a great reward and changes life, he still gets a great feeling of satisfaction.
I don't think he feels bad for that.
He's just so happy that he's done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy and a good family father.
He's a hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, “If someone had to win me, I’m happy that it was Isaac.
And I think Isaac would have thought the same way if this had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior will return to the eighth season, which will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers Swim Over Minnesota Twins
The second half of the season has not been very funny to Detroit Tigers.
Tigers was sometimes one of the best baseball teams, but is now the last in American League Central.
Tigers played his role perfectly on Tuesday when he won Minnesota Twins on 5-4 Target Field.
Twins lost the chance to get off Houston Astros in competition from the second American League Wild Card.
For Detroit, the game was a return to the six-letter H-word pair for at least one night, which had been very difficult to reach for most of the last half of the season.
“All the winnings are funny, no matter how they get them,” said Brad Ausmus, the team leader of Tigers.
Tigers feeder Alfredo Simon continued his early attack support when Detroit ran three times in the first two turns, and then once again in the sixth and ninth.
Simon (13-9) fed 6 1/3 in a row and saved three runs.
This was only his third quality start in the last nine games.
\"I just want a strong ending this year,\" Simon said.
It’s hard for the exchanger to play every game, and that’s why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers' deputy, Victor Martinez, hit three times, and allowed two runs that were his first hit after mid-August.
This was the first three night of the Battle Mariners hit four times on July 6.
\"He was a good guy,\" Ausmus said.
He looked good (in betting exercises), looked much better in betting exercises, and continued the same model in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind the second half of the seventh pair, and it was their best chance to get back to the game.
The Senteri Byron Buxton started the co-op by knocking out twice on the left field line.
Aaron Hicks, on the right side of the nest, was fired by one nest, and Simon was burned directly to another slot player Brian Dozier before Simon switched to the left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player in front of him, Miguel Sana, a pre-starter, to the left of two nest runs from Drew VerHagen.
When two runners were on the field and a levelable runner in the second corner, VerHagen got the three-pin Trevor Ploffen to hit the top-tier painting.
It was the main series record: 27 times this season, when Ploffe hit the double.
After Detroit had received a security run at the ninth initiative, Mauer would kick out two beats of Tigers' lock-up against Bruce Rondonia, and the situation was 5-4.
However, the real-handed player burned Sana in three feeds in the fifth rescue.
At first, Detroit used Phil Hughes in rust.
Tigers got three runs in the first two turns against the right-hand veteran player who got out of the list of injured people before the game after being out of the game for more than one month due to the infection of the lower back.
“It’s obvious that I didn’t want to start like this,” Hughes said, “but as the game went forward, I was more comfortable, and I felt that I was able to make a few nice feeds on the third turn.
After Hughes caught the first nest of the beginner, he gave another slot player Ian Kinsler to go one step.
The walk of the right side of J.D. Martinique, in the case of two fires, brought Victor Martinique, who took himself to the first stop of the game by midfield, and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez cut off his 0-21 tubes while the runners were in good running positions.
The third player, Nick Castellanos, continued to hit the right and caused another run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martin was rejected when he was trying to move on to the three-point.
Tigers continued with the second pair and got one fire, two nests in the situation of the kidnapper James McCann, and two fires, one nest in the situation of the run-in sentri Anthony Goelt, after which the situation was 3-0.
\"It was an important hit,\" said Paul Molitor, the director of the Twins team.
He didn't hit very well, but it flew to the right.
Hughes began to be in the feed lock and fed the runless third pair, after which he replaced the right-hand successor A.J. Achter.
Hughes was given three runs from six strokes and a walk with four fires.
NOTE: Tigers' right-handed feeder Anibal Sanchez had to go away due to the stretching of the shoulder.
He was examined by Dr. James Andrews who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of injured persons since mid-August due to shoulder pain, but he had to return on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is outside, the left-handed feeder Daniel Norris comes from the list of injured persons to start against Twins.
Norris' statistics in Tigers are on 1-1 in four initiatives after the left-handed feeder David Price switched to him on 30 July.
Norris has been out since August 20 due to the stretching of the right veggie of the abdominal muscle.
The three-game series of Tigers and Twins finishes on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.33 ERA) is set against the right-hand feeder of Minnesota against Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for more economic opening to the world
The economy should be more open to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told the group on Tuesday, whose task is to guide the reform.
\"China should be committed to attracting foreign funding and expertise and developing transparency policies,\" he said at the 16th meeting of the group leading to the deepening of the general reform.
Support for transparency at the same time as reforms are being pursued to increase new movement and vitality, and to create a new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Management Group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list of market access restrictions, a loosening of border control principles, a call for state-owned companies to seize private capital, and a review of the residential registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list of sectors and companies which cannot be invested is created.
The system is gradually tested and improved through pilot programmes.
The change must be noted as it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more transparent, the opinion states.
The government will also loosen its control over the power it shares to companies, ensuring that companies decide on how to manage their business.
The opinion also stated that China would allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for the development of regional growth.
In order to open up government-controlled sectors to private donors, more areas will be opened.
“The administration does not change its approach to foreign investment and should protect the legal interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services,” the opinion said.
In addition, the search process will be facilitated by optimising the requirements and reducing the search process for foreign residents’ permanent residence permits, the Green Cards.
The meeting also discussed the provision of professional training rights for lawyers and the support of professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, the opinion published after the meeting.
