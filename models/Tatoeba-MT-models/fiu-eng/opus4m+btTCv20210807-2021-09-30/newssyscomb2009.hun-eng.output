The victory of right-wing populists in Austria, with a total of 29%
The apparent weakening of the two parties to the grand coalition so far and the significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties, according to the first preliminary results, is a Sunday of the Austrian pre-arranged parliamentary elections.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of the current president Wilhelm Molterer, in particular, was seriously lost.
On the other hand, the President of the Association for Austria's Future (BZÖ), Karintia's provincial superior, Jörg Haider, is preparing to return to national politics.
On the basis of the preliminary results, the country’s strongest party remains the Socialist Party (SPÖ) with 29.8 percent of the votes, but lost 5.5 percent of the votes compared to the last 2006 elections.
Even worse, ÖVP, which loses nearly 9 percent of the votes by 25.6 percent.
These are the worst achievements of both major parties in the post-war history of Austria, and, in particular, the result is literally catastrophic to the people who make the pre-arranged elections.
At the beginning of July, when leaving the ÖVP coalition, the People's Party had a significant advantage before SPÖ according to public opinion studies.
However, the voters were apparently punished for letting the government fail.
In the first reactions to the results, speculations have already been expressed about the possible withdrawal of Wilhelm Molterer's party president and the current beginner cell.
The observers believe that this may take place on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party bureau.
This development is likely to make it easier for the election result to be the more likely way out, i.e. the renewal of the big coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) has previously obtained 18% of the votes and 11% of the votes - but the Social Democrats have expressed their fear of repeating the 1999 year, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (the FPÖ was still united at the time, the BZÖ left the BZÖ in 2005), which has even imposed sanctions on the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is willing to cooperate with any party, and I suppose he can return to Vienna in national politics, is obviously a solution.
The Greens Party, however, has come to Parliament, which has lost some popularity, and the Austrian political parties have returned from the third place to the fifth.
None of the other parties crossed the 4% limit and did not enter the parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Indian relations can be cooled
If you could not solve the problem of the Czech scientists registered for illegal bug collection, according to the Czech Minister of Foreign Affairs Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain degree of defamation could occur in Czech-Indian relations.
This was published by the minister in New York after a meeting with Pranaab Mukherdji, an Indian partner today.
“If this were not resolved, then yes, there would be some persuasion,” he said after the meeting that took place from a Czech incentive.
After the trial, Mukherji said that the executive power in court cases could be difficult to intervene.
However, he mentioned that, in the case of Petr Švácha, an accused and convicted person, the central government may negotiate with the local government of Dajereelgi, whose law is the case.
“His problem could be solved,” the minister said.
The three-year prison sentence for Emil Kučera said that it would be best to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Then he could apply for a bail and wait for a sentence, he explained.
Schwarzenberg has confirmed that his partner has expressed himself in the same way during the trial.
“He offered an appeal to the Supreme Court, then it would be possible to rescue him,” said the chief of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech party can intervene in the whole case is to provide “superficial legal support” to the convicted, the Indian minister said.
At the same time, the Indian party has already provided them with such help.
“Our main interest is to maintain the best relations with India with many years of tradition.
This is recognised by Indians, said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he said to the CNK, his partner stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
“We think it’s a serious mistake to arrest and prosecute these Czech scientists,” he said.
On the question of whether the Indian party has been promised to deal with the issue, the minister has excluded the answer.
“I’ve had a lot of promises,” he said.
Czech judges in the fight for the seabed
Enter the wall electronic map on which Australia and neighbouring sea areas can be seen.
He is not interested in the continent, but is an excellent point in the blue of the ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia and along with the neighbouring seabed.
In the area as much as the continent itself, Luigi Santosuosso is an Italian lawyer who belongs to the thirty-thirds of the UN Division’s working group on the ocean and maritime law.
His chief, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, director of the division, monitors the explanation, which is sometimes supplemented.
Work and enthusiasm prevail here.
The seabed is rich in natural resources, it hides a world that has not been known so far.
It is possible to find oil, ore and other minerals, but also unidentified living organisms, which, for example, can be the key to the development of an anticancer medicine.
Seabed larger than the dry land
Today, coastal states are seeking intensively for new sub-sea areas.
According to the UN Convention, their rights are enforced, which was agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is primarily the area of the so-called continental site, which often stretches up to a few hundred kilometres from the coasts of the country.
According to the Convention, such a country has the exclusive right to all sources of the continental site.
“By simplified, we hold the continental floor of the seabed and its bottom layer, which is the natural continuation of the underground part of the sea.
On the shores of the sea, often along the borders of the two hundred sea miles, it goes beyond the borders of the only economic zone,\" Mikulka explains.
The application submitted by the country to the Commission at the external borders of the Continental Site shall be supplemented by a wide range of scientific and technical documentation based on costly research and measurement.
This is the result of many years of preparatory work.
One of our tasks is legal and professional assistance to the Committee.
The Committee has so far discussed five requests, Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries mentioned have succeeded,\" Mikulka adds.
In the world, Australia’s success has brought about an echo, which has first substantially expanded its underwater country.
But New Zealand also won - the area of the seabed for the committee is about 1.6 million square kilometers, which is six times higher in the country.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in research.
The profits from the future use of the seabed are expected to be invaluable.
Other countries continue to submit their applications.
The “Montego Bay Convention” may do so within ten years of its ratification.
Where the continental site ends, the area of the oceanbed declared by the Convention is the common heritage of man.
There is no single country here.
The right of extraction in this area shall be granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
“The seabed, however, is not Klondike,” says Mikulka, who says, “one of its areas has been legally surrounded and their regime has been established in a contract.
Czechs in the Pacific
Some of the seabeds are now part of the Czech Republic.
This former Eastern Block is divided into other countries within the Common Interoceanmetal.
In 1991, like the investors of some other countries, this organisation received the status of the so-called \"passenger investor\".
It is entitled to produce in the ClarionClipperton zone between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati on the Pacific Ocean.
The area examined by the investor is somewhat higher than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is a copy of the Tatra under the sea.
“This can be produced in a total of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetal coins containing nickel, raspberry, cobalt and manganese,\" says another lawyer, Hindu Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, a member of the Division Macedón, presents an example of another consistency.
A potato, or a little fantasy, reminds me of the pergamen with the magic words of Golemet.
German special forces were present at the hostage release
The Egyptian government sought assistance from Germany to resolve the crisis - and the professionals came.
When the situation became a joke, the special units were ready, but there was no action.
The liberation of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt is becoming more and more detailed.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Interior, German special forces were involved in the rescue operation.
In addition to the German Federal Army, GSG 9, the German Federal Police, and the Federal Crime Office’s staff, as well as the German Technical Service’s logistics experts, were also on the site of liberation.
According to the information of the ministry spokespersons on Monday evening, the German forces were not needed, however, because the hostage were allowed to run their prisoners and then fled when they recognized the signs of violent hostage.
The Egyptian government accepted the assistance offered by Germany to involve it as an on-the-spot support force.
“Unfortunately, no spokesperson of the Federal Ministry of Home Affairs was given.
The attackers were kidnapped from five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian women, and eight Egyptian escorts in the south of Egypt on September 19.
After the kidnapping of the South Egypt Desert, the hostages were dragged here and around the border areas of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The existence of hostages remains unclear until now, as well as details of the release of hostages or possible ransom payments.
In the meantime, the refugees arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He didn't tell me about the details of the release.
In Berlin, there was no information about when they would return to Germany.
According to the “Bild” newspaper, five tourists and special forces arrive on the German Airbus aircraft to Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House rejects the rescue package.
The U.S. Congress's lower house failed with a small majority of the money market's proposed $700 billion rescue package.
Dow Jones fell into the deep.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets by 227 votes.
Despite the calls made by President George W. Bush and the leaders of both parties, the program was not a majority to stop the chaos in the money markets.
The supporters desperately attempted to convince critics of the need for a $700 billion package during a dramatic action.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the Democratic Party, called for the members to be supported, even if the plan is so unpopular.
“It’s hard to get political support to avoid something that hasn’t even happened,” he said.
Dow Jones also dropped more than 6 percent and 600 points during the vote.
Investors were concerned that the state rescue package could fail.
The index rose shortly before the end of the vote, so that it would fall again after the failure to publish.
Experts are counting on further serious market failures in international financial markets.
To enter into force of the programme, approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is required.
The directors register more and more reservations.
It's a good winter for German travelers.
According to a study, the traffic of the road reservations for the next few months has increased significantly compared to the previous year, with more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak conjunctural prospects, the Germans’ travel rate did not fall according to the study.
In the winter year’s reservations, travel agencies reported a 31 percent increase in traffic compared to the previous year’s period, according to the German Travel Association (DRV) in Berlin on Monday.
According to an examination by the GfK Market Research Institute, the number of monthly reservations in the autumn is already higher.
In October, the traffic of travel agencies was 11 percent higher than October 2007, and the DRV said.
These results are based on GfK data, which evaluates the monthly booking data of 1200 German travel offices and then extrapolates the entire market.
The Institute took into account the trips occupied by the end of August 2008.
Because of the weak dollar price, travel to the United States was particularly sought, the DRV said.
Here, the volume of reservations rose by one-third.
The Germans are particularly fond of their travel goals, in addition to Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the domestic landscapes.
Most often, the organized roads were sought,\" said Klaus Laepple, president of the DRV.
As a result of rising energy and food costs, the cost of organised roads can be calculated in a better way for passengers than for individually organised trips.
Passengers can save money with booking discounts or all inclusive offers - Laepple added.
The booking rate for summer months was also very good, so it will be possible to re-register traffic growth compared to the previous year, although a further study shows that less German tourists have committed to the trip compared to the previous year.
The first Oktoberfest
Without a stop, replaying ballermann hits, literic chord beers and fashioned dirndli wearing celebrities.
The documentary is Wiesnen.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I are not really much like each other.
She wears a blonde, TV shower and a customized dildo.
My hair is dark, I'm a student girl, and I bought my clothes in the furry.
However, one thing connects us: We've been on Wiesnen for less than three minutes, we're already running through our photographers and filling their memory cards - very flattering, and all of this on my first visit to Wiesnen.
That's how we can make friends.
It seems that the cheap dirndli meets its purpose.
As a homeous Wiesn tourist from the white sausage to the north, my comfort scene is still bordering the population.
But when he arrives at Theresienwies, it's not that bad anymore.
Almost everyone wears a raspberry or leather; no one looks visy or awkward - everything is all right.
Strange looks at the chocolate candidacy, but only my Dirndli bond.
A woman in Munich reminds me that I made the bond wrong: “You are free, in the middle of a virgin, in the right hand, in the back of a widow.”
Secretly, I've moved the manni from the back to the left.
“That’s good,” he says, and laughs.
Others strike less blows around fine floping techniques and wear a simple filter card, “I’m too drunk to dress up,” with a sign, and they show their naked backs unspeakably.
The young man with the characteristics of exhibitionist is called Bob, and he also visited Oktoberfest for the first time.
What you find very fantastic is a long stretch of \"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
He then tells me that he got rid of the contents of his past drink.
Right next to one of the fire squads that everyone looks like.
Bob is one of the famous “innocent immersors”
Others are not so lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o’clock tonight, the ambulances are going to be able to go through the scene and take care of poor couples.
Patients always appear in a team - at the same time four of them carry a covered barrel from the tent to the tent.
This works like most visitors to Wiesn: Arrival empty, departure plug-in.
Who's in the alcohol cave under the pony, it doesn't look like it.
“These are the ones who are completely ready,” he cried out to me on my question, and then in the round.
Police named the victim of the accident.
The police named the 63-year-old lady who was hit by a vehicle in Essex County and died in the hospital.
The accident occurred on Friday afternoon with the resident Chelmsford Road, Carole Paulson, on Shenfield Road, in the city.
He was transported to a hospital called Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later he died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested with suspicion of careless driving.
He has been released for bail since then.
Turkey's diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey’s intention to join the European Union, European powers have been burned from the desire to penetrate Turkey deeply into Turkey’s back country.
On the eastern side of Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps from the European border, one of the greatest relics of failed imperial aspirations.
The Hydrapasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in a neo-sensian style.
At least the books write that.
The building surrounds the end of the arenas, with one tower at the front corner of each of them, and looks like a German rural townhouse.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building's a little overrun.
However, in view of the interior of the store’s ticket office, it is obvious what a large-scale business this was the most western gate.
The station was opened by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation in August 1908.
Germany, the future of the conquests – from Damascus to Baghdad, with the help of today's Saudi Arabia-led railway, wanted to implement its ambitions to capture the Middle East.
The German conquest efforts collapsed during World War I.
The railway lines were attacked by the Arabs Lawrence and Arabs.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The British colonial army left Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The Hyderpasha station was no better.
In 1917, an ammunition train exploded and destroyed the building’s well-developed top.
According to Turkish sources, there was a sabotage action.
Since then, history has been slowly destroyed and overrun.
At the same time today, as the doors of the railway to Anatolia and the entire eastern region - at least in a symbolic sense - serve as a diplomatic horizon for Turkey.
The Party of Truth and Development in the Government - the AKP - has developed a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The new policy is marked by the commitment to metal.
It is worth noting that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian groups of Hamas and Fatah, Iraq, Iran, as well as, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to measure the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I went to the Turkish capital, the night train to Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish MP, Suat Kinikooglut.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours after the dwindling, which, at the time, gave me the rhythm of the famous documentary about the old world, the rhythm of “The Night Mail,” I arrived in the capital of Turkey. The new city is the symbol of the new world state, which turns back to the past.
However, the AKP is a paradigm change with the commonly Islamic roots in the Turkish Consensus.
This has caused some suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
I went with a taxi to the AKP Cathedral, an ultra-modern, stone and steel, saying to this end a building that stands in a developing suburb, half-prepared between malls and coffee houses. In the latter they meet the middle heads of the suit, both men and women, to make a deal early in the morning.
Suat Kinikooglu would have included a right-wing politician in any other European country.
He was wearing a suit, tie, and I'm sure he even had a Blackberry.
“The party’s foreign policy objective is to help Turkey integrate into its immediate environment.
The Cold War has upset the order,\" he said.
Turkey is isolated from its back country.
He had to turn east and west at the same time.
He couldn't choose between the two.
He had to open both directions.
“But it’s possible that sooner or later he’ll be forced to choose,” I asked.
“Turkey never wanted to get in front of us.”
He then stressed what almost everyone I spoke to here, and then he repeated almost mechanically: Turkey, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the countries around the Black Sea, has the same advantage for Europe and the United States as Turkey itself.
As if they wanted to communicate a message that, in a cross-border sense, all of Europe, together with Turkey, can reach Asia and the Middle East on those east-eastern railway lines.
When I was at the Hydrapasha station again, after another night, mostly awake, I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conura, the two German gentlemen who looked through the building 100 years ago.
That they were surprised to know that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East are now largely in Turkey’s hands.
And as I waited in the harbour for the ferry to return to the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was called “the sick man of Europe.”
At the time, there was no question at all which part of the earth should be required for this exciting country.
Rememberable Life Trips: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown wrote: Since 1962 as Guildford's music director Vernon-Tod-Handley led the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus.
On the basis of his musical plans for the city, he founded his wonderful youth choir Proteus the following year.
In principle, only people under the age of 21 could have belonged to the singing box, but when Proteus sang his finals in 1979 - many of us have been at the end of our 20s - we simply refused to buy it from the choir.
The name ‘Proteus’ (the mythological variable name) was in line with the determination and ability of the choir to cope with any bag they put in front of it – whether it is a mattress or a piece of Messiah; without escort or with a large orchestral escort.
The diversity of the music of such a young choir was often amazing and always exciting, and we thanked the man whose inspiration to music remained unchanged over the years.
How often Todd told us to “let music speak from itself”
He always said, “The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the bag.
So sing, sing, sing.
Karmester's technique has always been fully understandable and accurate, but has never been a dictatoric or exaggerated.
Whatever the music standard was, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner wrote about it:
If he ever lived as a driver who was supposed to be a knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, he led Guildford Philharmonics.
In the past forty years, I wrote about more than 100 concerts, but never, ever, has disappointed and often stepped up with them.
In Tod Handley, there was a great and humbleness together, which was very rare.
He hated the conductors who, living with his words, simply “with a well-known battle all over the world.”
Many of us will miss it.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to your William Woodruff (September 25th), “in 1946 he continued his economic history studies in Oxford, and in 1950 he became a scholarship to the Hobullon-Norman Research Institute... while constantly preparing for the basic diploma, master’s degree and PhD title.
This comes from the authors of Woodruff’s “Beyond Nab End” work, but it’s wrong.
Between 1946 and 1953, under the leadership of Professor J. D. Chambers, he completed his PhD dissertation on the British rubber industry, which was then released in 1958 at the British rubber industry.
In 1950-51, he actually stayed in the United States with a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and in the summer of 1952 at the Illinois, New York and Harvard universities.
In 1953 he left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
You can't know why Woodruff made his career look like this.
J. Vicente Resino on the Cheerleader
\"J. Vicente Resino-Flamenco and Life-\", I recommend the exhibition because the photos of black and white, documentary style are impressive.
The respect for the simplicity and strength that harms them, as well as for the people in the photos, has attracted my attention.
This exhibition can be passed by emotions.
Resino understood the magic moments to be inherited.
Second time sales record at Honda
In November, Honda will start marketing the second generation Jazz.
True, his predecessor was already large enough for the passenger, but the design of the interior of the new model was even wider.
This is combined with sophisticated mechanics, which makes driving more comfortable and increases fuel savings.
Evolution versus revolution.
That's how the second generation Honda Jazz looks.
Although it is very similar to its predecessor in the sight of the new Jazz, many internal changes have been made to it.
These include innovative design, new bodywork, larger sizes and new mechanics.
But before we turn to a detailed description of the new model, we have to tell you that the new Jazz appeared six years after the launch of the first generation.
So, first of all, we can say that Honda managed to renew this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
Jazz is less well-known in Europe, but in other markets it decides sales records.
Such a market, for example, in Japan, where in 2002, and then in 2008 Jazz was the most sought-after car brand.
In Japan, for example, nearly a million copies of Jazz have been sold to the market.
The second market was the Old Continental, with nearly half a million sales sales in six years.
However, Honda wants to further increase traffic in the region with the new Jazz.
In 2007, while the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Jazz, by 2009 estimates target the sale of 100,000 cars, leading to a 17% increase in the European market.
Since 2002, Honda has sold 8,000 Jazz, which represents 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
In the case of the new generation, the leaders of the Spanish subsidiary will calculate with an example sold during the course of one year.
In fact, the arrival of this new Jazz will greatly alleviate the decline in Honda’s traffic in Spain.
The company’s representatives predict 22,000 copies sold by the end of this year, which is 4000 less than the 2007 data, i.e. a 16% reduction.
Despite the sales conditions, Honda increased its market share in Spain, which rose to 1.8% last year.
I would also like to increase this rate to 2% by 2010.
Honda hopes it can be achieved by introducing a new model.
This would be the Insight, a five-door and compact size - 4370 mm long - hybrid, from which the Japanese company would market 20,000 pieces per year in a global relationship.
According to the Japanese producer, the share of Insight would be 50% in the United States, while the remaining proportion would be distributed between the Old Continental and Japan.
The introduction of Insight after the official presentation of Valencia scheduled for January is due in the first months of the year.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz became wider in all respects.
The length reaches 3900 mm (five cents longer), the width of 1690 mm (two cents wider) and the axis distance increased by five cents, i.e. 2500 mm.
Its height is unchanged 1520 mm.
In addition to the dimensions, the passenger space has become wider.
The larger interior is guaranteed by the new armour, on the one hand by the central fuel tank - this solution is already known from the previous Jazz.
In addition, the - so-called double flooring - a fully loaded container, currently has a capacity of 399 liters, i.e. 19 liters, over the capacity of the first generation.
Although this includes the type with a 1.4 engine, Honda Jazz's luggage is 379 liters.
Some external modifications can also be found, such as rear-end lamps or optional panoramic glass roof, as well as easier access to rear seats.
In addition, the opening angle of the doors of the rear seats was raised to 80 degrees, compared to the opening angle of the first Jazz 67 degrees.
The second generation Jazz engines are new.
At the beginning of its rotation, this small model can be ordered with two, 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Thanks to i-VTEC technology, the consumption of both resources is more favourable to its previous model and is characterised by smaller CO2 emissions and excellent mechanical coordination, while the engine offers outstanding performance in all respects.
The output of 1.2 liters of the resource is 90 hp at 6,000 and the maximum torque is 114 Nm at 4900 rpm.
This engine, which was 78 horsepower in the previous Jazz, consumes 5.3 liters and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
The other engine, which produced 83 horsepower in the previous generation, now reaches 100 horsepower.
The 100 horse-power 1.4 Jazz consumes an average of 5.4 liters and its emissions are 128 grams of CO2.
The Cave of the Colliding –
To develop accident prevention technologies this time, Nissan is a new invention of inspiration from the world of bees.
The Japanese company has designed a robot to avoid accidents following the fly of the bees.
The Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C may be the first step to develop conflict prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. Advanced Technology Center in cooperation with the advanced scientific and technological research centre of the University of Tokyo, Japan, built this little robot.
Kazuhiro Doi, Technical PR and Research Brand Manager, according to the definition, is a further extension of the four-level safety guard envelope in Nissan.
The robot makes the company’s products more complete.
While flying, every bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to Nissan’s safety guard cover.
However, its role is much more important in the complex eyes of the uterus, with which you can see more than 300 degrees in every direction.
To copy the complex eye function, engineers designed a so-called laser telescope (Laser Range Finder).
The instrument identifies the obstacles in a 180-degree visual space before BR23C within a period of up to 2 meters, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately becomes an operation to avoid collision.
“As the perception of the barrier occurs, the small robot, following the movements of the uterus, immediately changes the direction of moving the wheels in a smaller or larger angle to avoid collisions.
The system is most distinguished from the instruments currently available, that in this case the avoidable manifold is performed automatically.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles – explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and project’s chief engineer.
Unlike bees, avoidable maneuvers cannot be directed upwards or downwards, and can not move in diameter, only in two dimensions, and only in the direction of the wheels, i.e. in an infinite direction and in a way that happens in the case of bees.
That is why Nissan used a rotation function in the robot in addition to acceleration and slowdown to avoid collisions.
“This structure only needs to process and respond to data every few seconds.
There is no need to store the data, nor the intuitive logic based on previous manipulates, so it can function with only a few dozen KB memorys without interruption.
It may sound surprising, but it's not gigabyte, but we're not even talking about megaby's big memory.
This is the first step towards the development of instant collision prevention technology, which, based on Nissan’s estimates, can be involved in serial-production cars within ten years.
The robot operates with lithium polymer batteries, which are easier and more durable than the lithium ion version.
In the future, a further application option may be to integrate the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to get the car to the end by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Fear of the mortgage
We have to admit that the U.S. Department of Commerce has a lot of cash, they have no reason.
Since the crisis is on their necks, and that Americans do not question the drivers of the eligible mortgage banks, they have created a fun and informative online game called \"Bad Credit Hotel\".
This is a hotel for \"Ross Loans\", i.e. the galleries.
The image of the accommodation and, in particular, the receptionist duo suggests that we should consider it once, twice, even three times, if the time of borrowing has actually come.
And especially where we need a loan, because this is probably the purpose of the thing.
The information available on the website is really useful, but little detailed.
It's more for teenagers than it is for the public.
But what would happen if we added the game?
For example, the room of our dreams will appear in the hotel.
In fact, it's something, because we don't dare to dream of buying a apartment...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced that it would provide equity to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). The largest Japanese bank will pay $9 billion for 21% of the company’s capital after Morgan Stanley shares’ exchange rate has fallen heavily on the stock exchange.
One week after the advance agreement was announced, the two banks said that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's stock stocks at a $25 unit price of $3 billion.
The accepted price remains more than 19% of the value of the securities according to the book of 31 August.
MUFG invests another $6 billion in the purchase of exchangeable securities, which provide a 10% return, and their exchange rate is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley reported that the global transaction is based on a $29 average price, which is 28% higher than the current exchange rate.
However, Morgan Stanley’s share price was reduced by about 17 hours to 6.79%, with it closing at $23.07.
“This strategic alliance offers Morgan Stanley a great opportunity to accelerate its transformation into a bankholding company,” explains John Mack, CEO of the U.S. Group.
Morgan Stanley approved the new status last week to diversify its activities, while being controlled by the Federal Reserve.
The agreement with MUFG reaffirms that the current financial crisis requires even greater caution from the corporate giants on Wall Street.
According to the conditions announced on Monday, the agreement has been modified in recent days: last Monday, Morgan announced that it will sell 20% of its shares to the Japanese company for about $8.5 billion.
“A week ago, we thought that the share would be made up of shares in total,” Toshiside Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG in Tokyo, Toshiside Mizuno explained.
“But due to the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimize and protect the potential risks.”
In terms of weighted average price, MUFG pays 7% more for Morgan Stanley shares than book value.
As a result of the transaction, the return on a share will decrease by about 20%.
On the basis of the agreement, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preference shares into shares if the trading rate of the latter exceeds the conversion rate by more than 50% over a specified period, i.e. about $47.
Morgan Stanley thus ensures that the funds from MUFG can make use of your investment opportunities, improve your balance sheet and increase your liquid resources.
However, the group spokesman did not want to provide accurate information on the two new allied strategic plans.
Following the acquisition of MUFG, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its solvency rate according to Tier I by around 15%, which will make one of the best in its own sector.
Morgan stated that his scale had improved since the end of August.
Over the past few weeks, the group has been given a great try, since the exchange rate of its shares has fallen to half, while the cost of securing non-payment risk has fallen into the sky.
This cost was reduced on Monday, but continued to be high at around 12%.
One of the major investor banks was left behind, after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. This Goldman Sachs, which announced last week that it had reached $15 billion: part of this comes from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa's Monday Declaration, Quito
Reconstruction of the Republic in the spirit of socialism of the 21st century.
This is the common plan for the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Evo Morales in Bolivia, and Rafael Correa in Ecuador.
Following the model of his fellow presidents and friends, Correa made his ideas about the new constitution on Sunday.
It was successfully completed because 64% of voters voted yes in the referendum according to the official results, which concerned 80% of the votes.
On the other hand, 28% of the population voted with no, 7% of votes were invalid, while 0.7% of the voters voted unfilled.
The draft constitution required 50% + 1 votes.
On Sunday, two polls were conducted at the exit of the polling offices and the billing conducted by a civil society organisation proved to be a huge majority of the votes with 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa spoke about the victory of his draft constitution from Sunday to Monday.
“The Constitution has won its overwhelming victory,” he said, and from Quito in Guayaquil, a south-west 280 km south-west, he thanked the Empire at the seat of the governor.
As well as the well-known, Rafael Correa Chávez, Morales and Chilean President Michelle Bachelet congratulated.
According to the U.S. Organization’s mission (OAS), the vote took place in a calm atmosphere. Its main theme was a 444 precise text that contained the principles of “new socialism” protected by the president.
The proposed constitution places the power of state in the service of the economy, while maintaining the right of the state to “design development” to a country that is essentially dependent on oil extraction by foreign companies and on foreign currency sent by migrants.
The draft constitution of Correa, which was elected in 2006, also strengthens the power of the Head of State, who can obtain a mandate for a maximum of two consecutive periods and is entitled to disband the Parliament.
Correa has already announced that she wants to live with this opportunity, and will again compete for the Prime Minister’s mandate in February 2009.
The constitution also includes the free provision of health services and education. The president has already started to introduce it in a country with 13.9 million inhabitants and half of the population lives under the minimum living conditions.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country, which may terminate the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of a Turkish facility that is based on US anti-drug measures.
Released 19 hostages in Chad
Egypt’s commander struck him on the kidnappers, who had been hostage twelve tourists and eight of their escorts for ten days.
The hostages are now in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and eight Egyptian escorts were held in the desert for ten days, from which they were transported unharmed to the capital of Egypt on Monday afternoon.
The hostages were released during the morning in Chad by a Egyptian commando.
Apparently in good condition, around half a day, they arrived with an airplane to the al-Maza military base, which is directly connected to the Cairo International Airport.
The hostages were banned from speaking to the press and were immediately transferred to a hospital in Mád, the suburbs of Cairo, where they were examined.
The hostages were “healthy,” and the kidnappers were “not paid a ransom,” said Zoheir Garanna, a Egyptian tourist minister at the airport.
The hostages were captured on 19 September at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border regions of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they participated in the safarin of the terrain. The group was then dragged from one of the havens of 35 unknown hostages to the other.
There were 11 tourists in the group (five Italian men, five German men and one Romanian women) and eight Egyptians: two foreign drivers, four drivers, one border guard and the director of the Agyptorg travel office.
According to information from a Egyptian security officer, a 30-member special commander arrived in two helicopters on the site, where he was hit directly before the flood.
\"There was a firefight among the troops, half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fled,\" said the leader who asked for his name to be heard.
He also said that a total of 150 people were sent to Sudan from the Egyptian Lightning Brigade, where German and Italian commanders were added.
Italian diplomatic leader Franco Frattini, who is currently in Belgrade, stressed the role of secret agents and special Italian action groups.
“We need to recognize that this result could not have been achieved without the professional and effective intervention of our secret service people and our action groups,” he said.
He also refused to pay the ransom for the hostages.
On the previous day, the Sudanese army announced that during the patrol patrol, a patrol was arrested, on which the kidnappers traveled. Six of them (including the Saudi leader) were killed, and two were arrested.
The army claimed that the hostage were related to a rebel organization in Darfur, the Sudani Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which was immediately clashed by the organization concerned.
Lettres - Most of the culture –
The debate on the financing of culture is currently at the heart of the newspaper news and the election campaign that is currently taking place.
We can only be happy about this.
But they still forget about a slice of our cultural life.
Who will raise his word to reveal the ridiculous amounts of small museums, archives, archaeological digs and national historical monuments on the edge of the famine?
Which politician dares to remind the federal government that he does not care about his monuments and buildings that are part of the cultural heritage?
Or do neither Quebec nor Canada have laws that truly ensure the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government only made three and a half million euros to restore the Chinon Castle in Loire Valley?
The Constitution of our neighbours of the United States states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the American culture, and that heritage must be protected in a coordinated manner by all citizens, all elected representatives and all government bodies.
Within the framework of the Québec Historical Association (Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec), more than 40,000 volunteers in history research and the preservation of large numbers of private archaeological and archaeological findings are engaged in the minimum budget.
Often, these organizations protect our teeth and protest with the last force of drowning when real estate developers and decision makers direct their bulldozers towards our old buildings and our forgotten cemeterys.
When will anyone stand up for the protection of historical and cultural heritage?
Part of the Fortis bank is stateized by the Benelux Governments
The Benelux States, with partial nationalization, are in trouble at the Belgian-holland bank, Fortison, with a total of EUR 11.2 billion in support of a financial and insurance institution with interest in Hungary.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and the Dutch governments agreed on the highest level at the end of the week, involving the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s Competition Officer.
In the euro area, Fortis bank is the first major crisis in the waves in the context of the international money market crisis that has been held for more than a year, and decisions in the case of the bank can therefore be regarded as precendenary in some respects.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, almost half of all three states (49%) purchase the bank's existing property.
The bank will certainly sell some of its interests, including, in particular, Dutch ABN Amro’s purchases – mainly insurance activities last year.
In the second half of the week, the shares of Fortis began to fall steep, and there have already been serious crises at the Institute.
However, analysts agree that the bank is too large with its 85,000 employees to let it go bankrupt.
The company's papers fell only 12 percent on Friday, 14 years in depth.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two-thirds.
In terms of current stock prices, the total market share of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to corporate managers, this is not realistic.
The company’s management has accused overseas market failures in adopting the $700 billion US Package Plan for the fall of Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers were slightly up.
On Friday, Philip Dierckx was appointed as a new CEO at the bank.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers, but no one has submitted a worthy offer so far.
The Belgian government has already indicated that investors do not have to worry, do not lose their money.
There has been no panic among the bank’s clients so far, the accounts have not been rushed.
In Hungary, Fortis has an independent account and also purchased leasing companies.
Rika in the chicken
In America, health and health insurance providers often refuse to enter into an insurance contract with the applicant based on people’s drug purchase data.
Data protection professionals are afraid that the data market will become uncontrollable.
“There is a data protection program that in all cases binds the use of the pharmacovigilance data to the consent of the person concerned.
This should be in an independent hand, otherwise we trust the hencot,\" said Richard Dick, the developer of the Washington Post program to follow the prescriptions.
Insurance companies depend on the health status of the applicant customer, the insurance premium and the amount due in case of damages, and if they consider the risk to be too high, they do not cover it.
In the past, the person was sent to medical examination and the contract was concluded only in the knowledge of the outcome of the investigation.
Dick has found a much cheaper procedure for ten years: according to the customer identification number of the pharmacy, it is easy to find out which medications he has purchased in the last one and a half years, and this program itself concludes what kind of disease he has suffered and what his health condition is.
For example, if you regularly take a high dose of cholesterol, it suggests that your blood fat level is virtually untreated, which is immediately listed as a higher risk category.
Several versions of the program are in circulation, some at the same time determine the number of risk coefficients, so the insurance company has little to do outside of paperwork, although there are little difficulties.
The disadvantages include that some medicines can be used for several purposes, such as certain compounds can be used against migraines or heat waves, but are also effective against depression.
The latter is a significant risk-enhancing factor for business insurers, the former are not.
Special companies were established to request and process the data, and they were asked for the patient's consent before obtaining the information they need from the pharmacy.
They are now obliged to do so by the authorities, although no punishment has been imposed for their past failure.
Some companies are still working on the results of laboratory studies, and they are also linked to drug consumption data, so they can provide a more accurate picture of patients’ health.
More and more companies have access to the data, and the monitoring of use will also become increasingly difficult.
There is a separate health protection law, but it applies only to health care providers and insurance companies.
Before the Congress, there is a legislative proposal that gives authorities control over companies specialising in reporting.
Dick Richard realizes that this is not enough: that is why he improved his program, which would lead to the transmission of data with the express consent of the data subject.
Another question is that the person concerned may not refuse the consent, otherwise the insurance undertakings will not enter into a contract with him.
So the hens are referring to the goodwill of the fox.
Global Marseille menu
It doubles trade between the European Union and India
Since the European Union and India are mutually leading trading partners, this topic has also been dominated by the agenda for the ninth summit, along with other and largely global problems.
Today, there will be a French-Indian summit, where nuclear energy cooperation will be mainly discussed.
While the European Union recognises that India is a high-ranking democratic power that should be brought into international affairs, Member States have failed to reach a common denominator, supporting the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This issue was not raised yesterday in Marseille, and now at the ninth summit.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the European Union and President of the Commission Manuel Barroso and Vice-President of the Foreign Affairs of Javier Solana, welcomed Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who was also agreed to double trade in five years, i.e. to a large hundred billion euros.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an ambitious target.
In view of this, the twenty-six bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been legally ratified, i.e. air traffic may continue to flow in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the consultation.
The aim is to balance that while the EU is India’s first trading partner, New Delhi is only ranked in the ninth place in the EU’s partners.
The summit drew attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as terrorism, were condemned in all forms by both sides and urged the UN Conference to be convened.
The end of the Doha trade round was also encouraged, although both of them have a large share of the previous failure.
The EU has confirmed that it is holding its energy and climate programme, i.e. it wants to reduce its emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed that a global deal should be reached at the climate conference next year and that the production of greenhouse gases should be reduced by 50 percent by 2050.
I would also like to prevent the rise in food prices and support the organisation of an international meeting to review the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is going to the French capital today, where at the bilateral meeting he is preparing to make a deal about the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, they are confident that French companies will be entrusted with €2 billion in value to build nuclear reactors in India.
News agency reports that the agreement would be for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian book publishers in Frankfurt
Italian publishers represent themselves with a strong field at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishing houses will be present at the most significant international copyright meeting at the 60th Buchmesse Fair.
At the Frankfurt International Book Fair this year, there are 7,000 exhibits from 101 countries, in 171.790 square meters, where more than 403,000 books are presented.
At the opening ceremony of Italian Pavilion, the Italian government will be represented by the Deputy Secretary of State of the Ministry of Cultural Javak and Activities: Italy, by setting up a single Italian Pont, will include 264 square meters of exhibition area.
The solemn opening will be followed by a press conference to be held in the House of Buchmesse 5.0 Pavilon, where there will also be an opportunity to present information, trends and prospects on the status of the Italian book publishing.
According to data, the Italian publishing market is constantly decreasing the proportion of foreign authors, especially in adult and youth publications.
The billionaire Steve Fossett's plane was found a year ago.
They found the remains of a billionaire Steve Fossett's plane that disappeared over the Nevada Desert on September 3, 2007.
The wreckages were found on a 3,000-metre high slope, in the district of Sierra Nevada, California and Nevada, in the mountains of Mammoth Lakes.
No human remains were found inside the plane.
John Anderson, Sheriff of Madera County, has disbanded all existing doubts: “After the findings of the flight’s situation, we have sent out a team, and we can now be sure that it is about the plane on which Steve Fossett flew off the day of his disappearance,” he said at a press conference.
The sheriff also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Department of Transport (NTSB) reported that a commission of investigation was asked a few hours after the discovery of the wreck, which was able to identify the aircraft, and found that it was indeed about Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on 3 September 2007, on the day that Fossett started from Yerington in Nevada on a three-hour flight.
Yesterday in California, near the border of Nevada, a couple found Fossett’s personal belongings near his home in Mammoth Lakes.
Two certificates of Fosset's name, issued by the Federal Aviation Control in Illinois, some cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was submitted after a month's disappearance.
The billionaire has set up a number of peaks to write himself into history.
In 2002, for the sixth attempt, he first managed to fly around the earth with a balloon: two weeks of solitary flight.
Three years later, he landed on the ground without landing.
There are many records of the Andean flight at 15.445 meters, carried out by a second pilot.
GLK, amazing advertising
It is an unusual, original and determined form of hobby, with large surfaces and pure corners.
In a few words, Mercedes-Benz’s latest compact terrain is the way the German car factory tried to bring fresh momentum to the market.
This is why, as a result of the traditional content, the SUV GLK launch campaign at Mercedes-Benz showrooms will also be surprising and unusual.
Because the advertising campaign accompanying the introduction of the new vehicle is a media communication tool unknown to this day, including the post-piss 3D blocks that the car brand has not used in Italy.
The giant spheric action, which consists of three stages, will dominate the central shopping street of Milan by 15 November, Corso Como.
The first stage of this new type of media communication begins with the presentation of the car's space, in which the new SUV, with special glasses distributed around Corso Como, will be visible in almost real size and in three-dimensional form.
The image viewer will have a feeling like the car will rise out of the poster.
After that, through the innovative Elumina8 technology, every detail of the new GLK becomes visible to each individual, to then put together in a uniform way.
No doubt Mercedes is trying to introduce something innovative with this promotion into the stereotip advertising world of the automotive industry.
Is it possible to attract the interests of future customers?
We show you who Italian football hooligans are.
They're probably out of orbit.
But who is this 150-200 boy and girl who is now ashamed of the whole of Italy? Members of the group \"Ultras Italia\", which has been following the selection for years, and which, in truth, has not caused too much trouble so far.
They never hit me with the opponent's fans.
The core of the group is right-hand.
The principals come from Trivento.
Like Verona, Padova, Trieste, and Udin.
These were joined in Sofia by smaller dispersal groups from Spain and Puglia (in fact only a few units).
Italian flags were flags, on which they were listed as the hometown of the fans: on Saturday they took them down so that they could not be identified.
They follow the example of English fans.
In Bulgaria, they were facing a real Nazi fans' team with Levski's drones.
The Italian Football Association gave 144 tickets to Italian fans. These were tickets to name, making it easier to check the Surkolo team.
The Ministry of Interior also checked everyone: there was no one to whom the proceedings would be ongoing, no one who would have been banned from visiting the stadium.
Four Italian fans, who have a record of football, refused tickets and exits.
The Ministry of Interior is currently waiting for protocols from the Sofia police, and then taking the necessary measures: the fans arrested or identified during the riots can also be banned for five years.
It is an international ban that applies not only to the visit of all the stadiums of Italy but to all of Europe.
So our football players can't put their feet on a football track.
Fortunately.
But we also need to be afraid that the hulligans will find followers, that is, that is, that this is barely one hundred and fifty people, that others will join.
“It is necessary to strangle this fire, not save the one who behaves like this,” the Ministry of Home Affairs said.
So it's better to keep our eyes open, especially since it's approaching Wednesday's match day in Lecc.
In Puglia, there is a smaller cell that supports Italian ultras.
Tomorrow, the Monitoring Service will be held, and on Tuesday, the Security of Sports Events, which can be counted as one of the departments of the Home Security Service, secret services dealing with the conduct of the fans.
\"Duce-Duce scanning and driving arm under the Italian hymn? Bulgaria is not a crime.\"
He expressed this idea, in a rather unfortunate way, Domenico Mazzilli, who was appointed a few weeks after the Ministry of the Interior’s observer service (the post was reserved by Francesco Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously chief of police in Trieste, the city where he has been operating a cell supporting the Ultras Italy group since 2002.
What Mazzilli says is true, in Bulgaria, it is not forbidden to promote Ducé, but the behavior of the 150-200 fans was disgraceful.
I am not a sociologist, he added the first person in the surveillance service, but the crimes must be judged in the country of the crime scene.
Until now, this group has not caused any problems. We need to examine exactly what happened and consider how to proceed.
But let’s talk a little about the extermination of the Italian hymn: it’s not a crime, but, if I may say so, it’s not a well-being.
