In addition to EU business support, the management of national corporate support will also be concentrated from mid September to mid-September to four elite centres.
In Eastern Finland, the South Savo Ely Centre in Mikkel is responsible for its activities.
According to the new Enterprise Aid Act, which entered into force at the beginning of July, EU Structural Funds must no longer be allocated to large enterprises unless it is entirely new.
The subsidiaries of more than five thousand inhabitants are also considered to be a great honor.
Instead, investments that improve the business conditions of municipalities can continue to be supported by the EU.
In Eastern Finland, about 30 people will be strengthened by an EU and national aid management unit.
At least for now, they all continue to work at their current locations.
For example, Kalevi Pöööse, Head of the Southern Savo Ely Centre, is in Joensuu.
Researcher: This is what Russia is trying to do in Ukraine now.
Russia works consistently, even though it does not always look like it.
The head of the Department of the Earth Defence School Strategy, Colonel, docent Torsti Siren was not surprised by the conflicting Ukrainian news of Monday morning.
This has been the same for a long time, siren says.
On the other hand, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov demanded an immediate ceasefire and announced that Russia would not attack Ukraine (read more here).
On the other hand, Ukraine says its parasol forces are currently fighting with the Russian tank department near Luhansk Airport, and that the tank department has received reinforcements (read more here).
Mr Lavrov insisted that the Minsk negotiations should make an immediate ceasefire without conditions.
Russia denies being involved and must immediately have the outcome of the negotiations in time for them to have their established position in Luhansk and Donetsk.
That's the whole story, siren says.
This is the big pattern: suddenly we need to start negotiating, and specifically so that Russia gets its own grip on the areas of Luhanski and Donetsk.
Finnair outdoors passenger services for Norwegian company, holidays for people
Finnair starts buying passenger services as a subcontract from the Norwegian crew service company OSM Aviation.
The agreement will first apply to Finnair Hong Kong and Singapore routes, but will be extended later.
Two routes in Finland will result in a total reduction of about a hundred years of work in Finland, which will be carried out at the first stage of the holiday, the company said when it announced.
In addition, the work of about 80 Asian temporary workers ends at the time of the exit of the routes.
Finnair has already said in June that it intends to exit around 20 routes of passenger services over the next two years.
It was concluded that there was no agreement on savings with staff.
The exhibition will be launched next year in January-March.
According to the company, negotiations on cooperation will also continue with other partners.
According to the study, sleep problems multiply the risk of nervous back pain, i.e. shock pain, for those who work hard.
The study of the Institute of Occupational Health followed firefighters for 13 years.
The connection to sleep disorders is surprisingly strong, even though many other factors were taken into account.
The good muscle strength and durability of firemen, which are tested regularly, do not appear to protect from pain, says Sirpa Lusa, the research director, in a statement from the Institute of Occupational Health.
Firemen’s work is irregular work, where turns can stretch up to 24 hours.
According to the occupational health institution, sleep problems are common in this type of work.
The results are based on a survey conducted in 1996, 1999 and 2009.
Do you know the surprising new causes of water damage?
They can cause damage to other apartments.
Water damage to water damage is not always caused by leaking pipe or goose, reminds us of the host union expert.
We have been contacted when the violation of the aquarium has caused water damage in the home company, whether aquariums can be banned, says Marina Furuhjem, a law expert in the host union.
Furuhjelm reminds us that only pipes and drains are not the common cause of water damage, but also more and more new machines, such as ice-flakes, have caused floods in housing.
Many people do not know that machines such as the washing machine or the washing machine should not be left unattended.
The water tank must also be kept closed whenever the machine is not on, as otherwise the pressure in the pipe can lead to a water leak.
A resident may be considered to have committed negligence if those obligations have been neglected, in which case the liability for damages shall be borne by the resident.
Of course, in these cases, home insurance may compensate for damages, depending on the terms and conditions of the insurance and the case.
If it can be shown that the resident has caused negligence, the resident shall be liable for compensation.
If the resident has gone to the shower on the floor roof, neglect can often be proved because in these cases the water has flooded elsewhere and the maintenance man comes to the apartment where the deceased is found.
Furuhjelm says that due to the emergence of the exit of the floor mines, two floor mines have been installed in the shower facilities in many student apartments today.
Water damage has also caused waterfalls, although not to the extent that they were more popular.
Even a dog’s water cup and the fall of a domestic wine can cause real water damage.
I also know the case where there were many cats in the apartment that had peed on the floor so that there were widespread damage, Furuhjelm says.
In the case of maintenance responsibility, the company always goes in the same way if the company’s company’s order does not provide otherwise.
The shareholder is responsible for repairing the surface material and damage to the structure of the house and damage to other apartments.
Water damage can easily cause damage to other apartments, because the structure of concrete really absorbs water easily.
According to Furuhjell, the battery leaks in the apartments are particularly difficult because the batteries are easily leaked to mysterious structures.
Water damage can be caused by today’s generalised air temperature pumps that produce condensed water.
Water should lead to solid sewage or rainwater network, not just a container.
The shareholder also has the responsibility to remove water, snow, ice and rubbish from the balcony, and the legal expert advises.
Furuhjelm instructs that, although the rules of the house company do not require, for example, a permanent removal of the washing machine, the insurance may be subject to the condition that the compensation is not received for this reason.
You should be careful with your home insurance policy.
However, I think washing machines are irrational, for example, the water removal pipelines in the tub are a major risk that has caused many damage.
I recommend that the exit doors always be attached to the drain pipe.
Extraction of snow and water on the balcony
Control of the washing machine, the washing machine, etc., while on.
Closure of water baths (storage machine and dishwasher)
The cleaning of the floor mine from visible parts twice a year and a half.
It is recommended to connect the exit doors to the drain tightly.
Check the taps and their possible leaks
Regular freezer melting

FC Honka lost again and poured out into a serial god
At the Tapioola Sports Park, two of the weakest teams of the football team met in the evening of Sunday.
In June, FC Honka, who celebrated the last victory, hosted seven games in a defeating pipe of the Vaasa Ball Society.
VPS just received its previous victory against Honka in July.
The meeting of Sunday with the Espoolia team came to a good bar, because VPS returned for a long time with a winning base of 2-1.
Elli Huttunen, the head coach of the Vaasas, complained before the game about the inefficiency of his team, but the confused Honka defense facilitated VPS’s goal-making problems.
A very nervous performance.
We didn't get any longer attacks at all, we didn't get the ball, Huttunen estimates his own show.
In the first half, Honga's top box, Milos Milos Milovic - Kosta Manev, played in a very uncertain way.
Both raspberry paints were created as a result of the discovery of the tops.
The contest was seen only after five minutes of the game, when Steven Morrissey directed by a Honka painter Walter Viitalan, who was talking about the shooting of Sebastian Strand.
I'm sorry about the first half of the time.
By the end of the day, the team did the opposite of what was agreed before the game, Honga’s head coach Shefki Kuqi took his ground.
After the initial shock, the Espoolians won their game together and rotated the ball at the head of the attack.
In particular, the middle-field player Carlos Portela and the scooter Roni Porokara were eager to search for the scenes, but the last solutions were almost repeatedly sunk.
The closest goal was Honga’s midfield man, Jussi Vasara, whose shot from 20 metres, however, was slightly past the VPS.
The VPS struck effectively by using its clever attackers and Honga's confusing toppatrip.
At half an hour, the raspberry made a 2-0-ostum when Morrissey and Cornelius Stewart reached a two-way drive.
Morrissey served and Stewart finished.
Morrissey was on a good game head during the opening season and repeatedly created situations on the left side.
Stewart’s speed seemed to be too high throughout the game for the escort defense.
“I heard in the middle of the day that if we lose, then we lose it with honor,” Kuqi said.
In the second period, the interiorized Honka applied for a roughly decoction painting.
The team was twice close to the hit until the third company succeeded.
Yerai Vilaboa finished the paint in the middle of the penalty zone.
After the Vilaboa goal, Hongda had half an hour to balance the match.
The Espoo team took more and more risks, which enabled VPS to respond to dangerous attacks.
Both Stewart and Morrissey got along with the Viitata once, but the dumbest fights of the Honka painter kept the home team in the game.
At the end, Honka was a little tired, and did not get extra paintings early.
With the loss, Honka was the last to have the final match of the Veikkausliga when there were seven more games left.
Putin threatened to conquer Kiev in two weeks.
Russian President Vladimir Putin was very loud in the telephone discussion with the President of the EU Commission Jose Manuel Barroso, according to the Italian La Repubblica newspaper.
Putin expressed her excitement about the European Union's plans to tighten the sanctions against Russia.
If I want, I can take Kiev in two weeks, La Repubblica says Putin's word.
According to the newspaper, Putin’s message to Barroso was this: It’s not worth irritating Russia with new sanctions.
Putin gave the Russian television first channel an interview on the Ukrainian crisis on Sunday night.
Putin said in an interview that he would hold the conflict entirely within Ukraine and that he would urge the Government of Kiev to negotiate directly with the rebels.
At the same time, he warned Kiev very much about the shooting of civilian targets in Eastern Ukraine.
You can't look next to Russia, if people are shot to death at a close distance, Putin said.
Esko Roine admits: The work of the actor destroyed the family
The hard work of the Concarinator and the theatre museum grew to recognize how the actor’s profession destroyed his first marriage.
The actor Esko Roine will fill next Friday for 70 years, but in his case, I think it is true to say that age is just a number.
I don’t notice any difference compared to one year ago or two years or ten years ago.
The spiritual puberty seems to continue, Esko Roine says.
Roine has been retired for years, but still he is pushing for many men.
It was sometimes joked that there were not many plays in this country without Esko Roinetta.
Roine currently plays the roles of the Helsinki City Theatre How to succeed in business life, the Tampere Worker Mind Los Angeles and the Tampere Comedy Theatre in Kvartet.
Roine will also be seen in the upcoming Risto Swallow movie.
KUVA: Reijo Hietanen
The role of the actor did not begin with a promise.
I didn't go to school to see a kid.
40-50 years later, the teacher said that I was so bad.
Esko Roine didn't go down.
The choice of the career was clear, there were no options.
It seemed close and loved.
I was so busy in the field that I left the school and went volunteer to the army just to get to the theater school as quickly as possible.
Roine has done about 200 theatre roles and 300 TV shows a little depending on how to count.
If things are calculated like the Engelsmanns that every part of the TV series is their own show, then TV shows are over 600.
I was three years in a new day, three episodes a week.
In the spring, I was killed when there was no time to do it.
Commitments to autumn 2016
Eskon’s isossák Eila, 83, and Liisa, 76, are in full attack and make the Tampere Labour Theatre even in the play of the wild roles as an anarchist.
The little brother's going on stage for years.
That's what it looks like now, but you don't know about this age.
I always have to make a small reservation that I'll come if I'm alive.
Some commitments have been made or promised.
There are reservations in Calendar for autumn 2016.
The years have left a man's track.
Age doesn't come alone.
The knees are operational, hip tends and arthritis trouble, but when you don't let it be disturbed too much, you'll get them out of here, Esko Roine says.
For the Tv audience, Roine became familiar, for example.
From the pirate radio, as well as a glance, where he shared hundreds of notes with Antti Einisto, hundreds of marcas.
It was Antti Einio, sharing hundreds.
I was trying to make sure that they were raining and not raining.
In the Reinikainen series, Roine was a wasteful co-founder of Captain Rautakallio.
He became the favorite of the Tampere policemen, when he happened to be the same commissary.
One of the policemen stopped the car on the street, took the window open, and shouted to me, \"It's a great Rautakallio.\"
Working Group Successful
The theatres in the minds of Roe and I have remained, for example.
The City Theatre of Helsinki Producer and Master's Department, the death of the Tampere Workers' Theatre, and the long day trip to the night to Tampere Theatre.
It is all about the fact that the presentations have been popular.
It's not my fault, it's the team's success.
Rimanites have also come.
The role of Pekka Woodhead in the film is one of those.
There's more.
The reason is that I have agreed too easily.
I don’t know if I regret those roles, but the final result is not self-perception or viewers.
You can’t choose your own work as a linewriter.
It's just nice to do what's been ordered.
In addition to theatre work, Roine has also tried to succeed in business.
In the 80s, he held a restaurant called Wanhat Roomeot in Tampere.
It was a teaching experience.
There was nothing about it when I tried to be the director of the Tampere Theatre, the actor, and then the nutritionist.
If I remember correctly, within a year, it turned out that they must not be reconciled in any way.
The typical thing was that when the screen was finished or in the middle of the day, and I was able to think about whether to put the sauna on, the restaurant became a call that there are your friends who wish to see you after the show.
Memories for Birthday
On the day of his birth, Esko Roine will appear in the memories, as dreamwriters Annika Grahn and Eija Mäkinen.
Some kind of nail they've created from a facemaker's memories.
At Zoom, I was once called a facemaker.
That's not what I've known.
The book has been written for years.
Ever before, Roine told me that no news bomb was in the promise, because she hasn't done anything so bad, or if she is, she won't tell me.
I wrote a small introductory phrase.
I say that if someone is waiting for scandalous revelations or good rumors, you should stop reading this.
There is a lot of professionally involved, as an actor as a theatre director.
The publisher also suggests that there is a tournament in the state of the theater.
It was a pretty normal student life, but the kakarana had to do all-like tricks.
It wasn't as loud as Turka's time.
It was very different.
I don’t know how much I got from there is more than self-confidence that when the school has been done so you know that it’s not close to it if you don’t get better.
I didn't have to think how good I would have been if I had gone to school.
Roine also remembers the legends of the National Theatre.
I was friends with Pentti Siimes, Tarmo Mann and Hannes Härinen and got to work with them.
There were legends from my first father-in-law, Kaarlo Halttu.
With Pia Hattara, we had a very close relationship.
Tauno Palo was already gone, but I was able to get to know him during school.
The middle son of the fire, Martti, was on the same course with me.
At the theatre school, Roine met her first wife, Marjukka Halttunen.
As a pain, he remembers his divorce.
After a relatively long battle, the children were split.
Not in two parts, but in a way that my daughter went to my mother and my son.
I didn’t think it was a good solution, and I think that children are quite the same now as adults.
In theatre circles, it is not uncommon for silver to be divided.
In the case of us, someone was thinking that I did a lot of work at the time.
I was in the theater almost every case.
Then there was television and radio on it.
I did a long day and my family life suffered.
On a party day, maybe free.
Esko Roine celebrates the Tampere Labour Theatre on September 7.
The party will continue at Helsinki City Theatre on September 21st and September 28.
There's a fan of thought out there too.
I was 50 years old and 60 years old at work.
When such an easy-to-motivating play happened, I thought that we would now hold the seventies, so we could get them out with a single rhythm.
Roe and I say there are no holidays as a real birthday.
I think it's free, but I'm not going to swear.
I might have done some work for that day.
Or then it's weird for the free night I'm going to have, Roine says.
Aviation companies concerned about the production chain
Some of the UK’s smaller aircraft manufacturers are concerned that supply chain manufacturing capacity problems may weaken the ambitious plans of major aircraft manufacturers to increase the production of passenger aircraft.
In the UK, thousands of companies in the manufacturing chain of aircraft are currently enjoying an unexpected amount of aircraft and engine development plans at the same time.
Aviation and Defence
At the same time, while some enjoy the order mix, there have been warnings of capacity problems and price pressure at the hands of the production chain.
“It is quite true that price pressure exists, especially now that the production volume poses challenges,” said Craig Gallagher, CEO of MB Aerospace, the major suppliers of aircraft engines such as Rolls-Royce.
According to David Bailey, CEO of North West Aerospace Alliance, representing around 240 aviation suppliers in North England, more capacity is needed.
“Do strategies and investment plans respond to these growth plans?
To be honest, I'm not sure about that.
Above all, we need more investment in the new production equipment and machinery needed to achieve these production volumes,\" Gallagher said.
According to some companies, the simultaneous implementation of new production plans and the increase in aircraft building is part of the problem.
According to Andrew Churchill, CEO of JJ Chruchilli, who produces gas turbine wings, the company has a great time behind it – when several new construction plans were implemented at the same time at the beginning of the year.
We moved from very low production to a state where production capacity exceeded.
Many orders were paid only afterwards, and in addition, we had to try to keep going.
However, it is useless to try to explain that the problem is due to the simultaneous implementation of new production plans,\" Churchill said.
JJ Churchill has responded to the challenge by investing £80,000 in new machines and hiring 26 new employees.
Many industry players believe that there is a need for more investment and coordination between small suppliers if the UK wants to maintain its position as the second largest player in the aviation sector after the US.
Ford Aerospace’s chairman and Tynesid’s engineer Geoff Ford say that the subscription fee should increase the confidence of producers and desire to expand the production capacity, as the work will be sufficient.
“If this doesn’t happen, we’ll lose the competition against other countries,” Ford says.
A few big players are trying to solve the problem by acquiring capacity.
The FTSE 250 aircraft and engine crane manufacturing company Senior bought parts of the aircraft in Malaysia with a UPECA of 75 million pounds.
Last year, MB Aerospace bought companies from North America and Poland.
“It’s possible to buy new operations from creative Start-up companies, but in reality, the most production slows down the design of the limitation and the number of engineers,” Gallagher MB Aerospace said.
Both small and large companies have mentioned the price pressure that has shifted them from large aircraft manufacturers and aircraft engine manufacturers.
Some people believe that the problems of the production chain operators are exaggerated.
Marcus Bryson, Head of the GKN Aircraft Manufacturing Unit, who also acts as a representative of the UK aviation trade, believes that the production chain has dealt with the problem better than in previous periods.
There's pressure in the supply chain, but I wouldn't describe the situation as critical.
“It is more important to introduce new technologies and advanced processes,” said Bryson.
Both Airbus and Boeing have taken mistakes to learn and are now more cautious in order not to increase the volume of buildings too quickly.
When Boeing tried to increase its production in 1997, it faced major difficulties when the company lost and the factories and the production chain fought to survive.
Tony Wood, Head of the Rolls Royce Aircraft Manufacturing Unit, says that the company has not yet encountered any problems in the production chain, which delivers most of the 18,000 required for the manufacture of the jet aircraft.
“You will certainly be smug, but we believe that we have done more thorough work on the supply chain by choosing the best partners and keeping in touch with suppliers when preparing them to increase their operations,” Wood says.
According to James McNerney, Boeing’s CEO, the company’s production chain has had time to prepare for an increase in delivery volumes.
We have a good feeling about the strength of the production chain.
We have been open to journalists, which is very important.
Fabrice Brégier, CEO of Airbus’s passenger jet manufacturing unit, says that the company will do its utmost to reduce the risks associated with its plans to increase the production of the A350 model to 10 machines per month by 2018.
“Sometimes one of the suppliers fails, and our task is to try to prevent this situation and to support suppliers and look for alternatives, but there are big problems,” Brégier said.
Bregiér says that Airbus is not looking for scapegoats: “The quality of the production chain is the responsibility of the editor.
This is the work of me and Airbus.
Hong Kong protest teams begin the “Citizen’s Inviolability Age” – in Beijing’s ban on open elections
China refuses to give full democracy to Hong Kong
The activists who support democracy spread to Hong Kong after China rejecting their open elections.
The groups that support Hong Kong's democracy emphasise that protests can be marked and swore to ensure that the city begins a \"a era of civil disobedience\" in order to resist the reforms proposed by the Chinese government.
Thousands of protesters threatened the coming rain against Hong Kong’s glowing horizon when they walked on the campaign of the Occupy Central Group in support of democracy to organize a demonstration in front of the Council’s premises for the implementation of laws on Sunday night.
The demonstration took place only hours after Beijing had announced that it would ban voters’ right to propose publicly in the 2017 mayor’s elections, thus threatening the six-month-long demonstrations that would further increase the city’s duplication.
The protesters will take part in the start of the Occupy Central movement in front of Hong Kong's central government buildings.
“We want fair and decent elections,” says Dion Tse, a 24-year-old website operator, who attended a Sunday demonstration with his 50-year-old mother, Wong Chi-y.
The government does not respect Hong Kong's voice.
We want the government to listen to us and see Hong Kong's determination.
China’s highest law-making body, the People’s Congress of China, adopted plans for electoral changes, allowing Hong Kong’s first direct elections to be attended by only two of the three candidates.
However, the proposal requires the approval of the 1200-strong appointing committee, and opposition politicians believe that this will prevent effectively different political views from being made available to electoral flags.
The protesters participate in Occupy Central Love and Peace protest, which was carried out in Tamar Park in front of the Hong Kong government building.
Police estimates that more than 2,600 people were currently involved in the demonstration.
A large number of police officers followed when about 100 protesters led by the Scholarism study group were gathered late on Sunday to Grand Hyatt, where member of the Communist Party Li Fein was expected to stay after his arrival in Beijing.
Benny Tai, one of the founders of Occupy Central, participated in the press conference with members of the Alliance for True Democracy, Scholarism and Federation of Students.
However, in order to comply with the law, he did not say the exact date on which the road blockage was carried out, but urged the participants to closely monitor the development of the situation in the next couple of weeks, while adding that the city is officially moving to the era of civil disobedience.
Benny or I'll answer the press questions.
\"Look at the person next to you,\" he said in a Sunday demonstration in front of the two demonstration boards that represent disobedience in China.
That man's power is in the center with you!
The 17-year-old gatherings of Scholarism, Joshua Wong, said earlier that the preparations for high school students’ demonstrations are ongoing and are designed to be held at the same time as thousands of university students are expected to demonstrate their opinion by refusing to teach.
“In addition to academic responsibility, we have our social responsibility,” Wong says.
In Beijing, Deputy Secretary-General Li Fei told reporters that the defence of public voting rights and international requirements is a waste of time and a source of some Hong Kong politicians who strive to confuse and mislead society.
“The impractical proposals such as the appointment of a public candidate have wasted a lot of time,” Li says, calling for an election method to be created in such a way that it fits the real situation of each society and the legal framework.
The General Right to Vote Bill can only be passed if a large majority of two-thirds of Hong Kong's 70-person legislative body supports it, which means that 27 opposition members of the Government can stop the initiative.
Li warned that Hong Kong might have to withdraw to a long-term political debate if the reform proposal is rejected by veto law.
“It would harm business and the development of the city,” he said.
Nearly 800,000 people voted in an informal questionnaire, organised by the Occupy Central movement in June, in order to resist China's demands, according to the requirements, the candidate needs the approval of the committee.
Up to 172,000 people marched on behalf of democracy on 1 July, while the march on 17 August, which supported Beijing and opposed Occupy Central, attracted some 88,000 participants.
Three people injured on the New York Beach
In a lightning attack on a New York beach, three people were injured.
According to the fire department, men were injured on the Orchard Beach beach in Pelham Bay on Sunday night when the heavy storms crossed the area.
The injured men are in hospital.
The extent of the injuries is unknown.
The lightning struck when the harsh thunderstorms were sweeping over the city.
The storm rains, thunderstorms, and sż stopped the Labor Day weekend celebration and the U.S. Open tennis match in Queens, and forced the music festival to close in advance on the island of East River.
Commercial flights to the city airports were late due to bad weather.
The new idea is not to be pleasant
This is the latest instructions from network users to employees and supervisors, and is shared by Harvey Schachter, author of the Monday Morning Manager.
According to the entrepreneur Seth Godin, the good idea is to recognize comments like, \"I don't like it, or I don't understand.
If this is not the case, the idea is probably popular and self-evident – then boring and everyday – or the benefits it brings are so little that it is not worth pursuing.
As a historian, Harvard Drew Gilpin never repeated anything that had already been published so that people wouldn’t think he had anything new to offer.
Now, as the principal of the university, he repeats the same thing several times so that the message goes to the ground widely.
According to the advertising consultant Bob Hoffman, TV and radio are the best tools to create demand, while the network creates a supply.
The fact that more and more people read news about the network does not mean that the internet is good between advertising – just as the first phone was a popular means of communication, but a bad option for advertisers.
According to the psychologist Heidi Grant Halverson, there is enough word for the motivation of employees: together.
In a study, participants were told that they decided to cooperate with the problem, even though they actually worked alone in an empty room. These participants worked longer and solved more problems than participants who were not informed of the cooperation at the beginning.
If the task is to find a recurring pattern or relationship between two units, performing expert Dave Paradise advises you to forget Microsoft SmartArt and instead use a Diagrammer.com program where you can choose between 14 different relationships.
Mount Stuart Hospital Disorders due to Security Risk
The specialist is temporarily separated from office, and the National Health System of the United Kingdom (NHS) stopped directing patients for cataract surgery in that private hospital after hospital problems emerged.
Two people applied to Torbay hospital after receiving first aid at Mount Stuart Hospital in Torquay.
The Torbay Hospital in Devon has said he was in contact with 19 patients on July 26 and has invited them to a clinical trial.
Mount Stuart's hospital regretted the matter and said it had been investigated after the doctor's separation.
The case came to the hospital in Torbay when two of the patients in Mount Stuart's treatment applied for its first aid due to eye damage.
According to Torbay Hospital, none of the 19 NHS patients who were all examined on the same day did need a repair surgery.
The Torbay Hospital and the medical district of South Devon and Torbay have not directed patients to treatment after the occurrence of Mount Stuart’s problems.
During the early days of the South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation in Torbay Hospital, the interim director, David Sinclair, said: “We have identified the problem in its early stages and were able to contact all the patients concerned quickly.
Whenever we direct patients to the service provider, we carry out quality and safety tests and ensure that the service provider meets the latest legal requirements and that its licensing issues are in order.
According to Gill Gant, the patient safety officer responsible for the patient safety of South Devon and Torbay, it is important that these cataract surgery is not carried out until we can be absolutely sure that the treatment is safe.
Ramsay Health Care UK, managing Mount Stuart Hospital, asked for “excellently forgiveness for all patients with complications.”
The company was reported to have called all the patients involved when we knew about the potential problem, from us, and later from the hospital in Torbay.
This specialist has been authorised by Ramsay Health Care since 2005, and has been a registered physician since 1989.
To date, he has performed 4 537 cataract surgery in different parts of the organization. According to statistics, the clinical results of the surgery he performed have been excellent, and the percentage of complications has been less than 0.5%.
Mount Stuart added that the doctor has been temporarily separated from office until the matter has been investigated.
What is \"4chan\"
Pahamaine anonymous communication site published the first substation images leaked by celebrities
What exactly is \"4chan\", and why was it the hacker's first option in his publication of stolen images?
\"4chan\" was established in 2003. It has brought about a discussion of the communication site, which is called as much as it calls for.
The site is divided into a number of parts, i.e., the announcement boards where anonymous users can discuss all possible, video games and travel to porn and hacking.
Unlike other web forums, users do not create a single, continuously used profile and their publications are not kept.
With the most popular announcement boards, comments may disappear in less than a minute, when the latest publications will bypass them at the bottom of the page.
These two factors have created a chaotic, anarchistic and surprising creative atmosphere.
Anonymist community members have created some of the most well-known mechanisms on the network (such as \"rickrolling\" and \"lolcats\", but the lack of rules on the site has also led to the fact that the site has a lot of doubtful or directly criminal content.
The most popular communication table on the site is /b/, which is intended for sekaline discussions and is regularly published in NSFW content (Not Safe For Work).
This may include the tame porn, but also raw and shocking images. The nameless hacker published the stolen images of the celebrities on this announcement board for the weekend.
American CytRx Invests in Cancer Medicine Research and Development
CytRx’s goal is to improve cancer – or at least slow it down.
A company that produces biological drugs in Los Angeles, which was subject to the research and development of cancer medications, which was the object of the stock sales for a little while.
The most promising drug is aldosterone, which is a more advanced form of chemotherapy-generally used doxorubicin.
CytRx conducts clinical studies in the treatment of aldosorubic soft tissue disease, the sarcoma and renewable glioblastoma or brain tumours associated with AIDS.
It's like a guided missile that goes directly to the tumor and not to any other body, says Steven Kriegsman, CEO of the CytRx company, on aldosterone.
My Aldoxorubicin contains so-called unit technology that works like a Trojan horse.
It binds directly to the protein in the blood, which also accumulates into the tumors, when the drug passes directly into the cancer cells.
The drug is given only in a acidic environment, i.e. in cancer cells, but not in healthy tissue.
This technology allows patients to be given more and more doses of cancer.
“It’s like a missile that travels directly to the tumor and not to any other body,” says Steven Kriegsman, CEO of CytRx.
Like many other biotechnology companies that focus on the development of medicines, CytRx does not make a profit.
This year, the company sold shares and thus raised $86 million to maintain operations and research.
CytRx is currently looking for 400 patients worldwide in a major 3-stage clinical trial in soft tissue disease alternative treatment.
Soft tissue disease is a type of cancer that develops in the soft tissues of the body, such as blood vessels, muscles and fat tissue.
Alternative therapy is used in the treatment of cancer when the initial treatment does not lead to results.
If the clinical trial is successful, CytRx plans to apply for a drug permit for the administration of U.S. food and medicines in 2016, says Kriegsman.
The drug could then be approved in 2017.
Analysts say that the data published by CytRx from the previous clinical trial in December showed that aldosterone was a promising treatment for soft tissue.
“It’s been a long time since the question was “we haven’t seen clinical information about how much it differs from the drug itself,” says Andrew Fein, an analyst at H. C. Wainwright & Co. Investment Company.
The publication of the results confirmed many opinions that this treatment is different.
Fein says, however, that it is difficult to predict the results and schedule of the current clinical trial, because it differs significantly from the previous study that produced good results.
Many things have to go right, he says.
Fein compares the development of medicines to the mining industry.
“First, a lot of money will be invested to find one gold salt, and the placement will continue for as long as that gold salt can be found,” he says.
The money is spent on research and development so long as the drug can be commercialized.
Many shareholders have requested CytRx to court because they believe it gave reality a better picture of its success.
The complaint accused the company of hiring a DreamTeam Group that then claimed to hire people to write positive comments about CytRx and another company in the field of biotechnology, Forbes, Seeing Alphan, Motley Fool and Wall Street Cheat Sheet.
According to the complaint, the articles were not found to have been paid by companies to authors.
As a result of the news, Seeing Alpha announced that he had deleted the articles that were against practice.
Other websites also removed several articles about companies.
Kriegsman refused to comment on the charges.
The company has hired an outside lawyer to respond to the lawsuits.
“I don’t have time or energy to concentrate on this,” says Kriegsman.
According to him, the real challenge of CytRx is to find talented workers who tend to employ centres of biotechnology such as San Diego, San Francisco and Boston.
\"This is in many respects from the perspective of the pharmaceutical industry,\" he said.
Analyst’s views
The price of CytRx's shares rose to $8.08 on January 10, and then fell to less than $3 in April when the charges for advertising shares came to the public.
According to the Analyst magazine, actions and negative publicity have decreased the price of shares below their real value.
“It’s unfortunate,” Fein says, “but I’m not sure if it’s any easy way to ignore this thing as long as the idea is in place.”
In the name of the law, the cameraman of the police series was killed in the middle of the descriptions.
In the name of the Law series, a true event-based photographer died on Tuesday evening when he was shot in the middle of a shooting incident.
The cameraman described the shooting between the armed robbery between the police department and the fast food restaurant, the suspect, when he hit the bullets.
He died quickly of injuries he had received.
The police reported that in the shooting incident, a suspect in the armed robbery was killed in addition to a cameraman.
The first series of true TV programs in the name of the Law has been presented in the United States since 1989.
In Finland, the series has been presented on MTV channels since the 1990s.
The question of an outsider is a crucial role in the treatment of the right to court that began today.
Anneli Auer is accused of murdering her husband Jukka S. Lahti in 2006.
The court of Vaasa now handles the case for the second time, because the Supreme Court restored it to the right to lead with new evidence.
The purpose of the court is that the judgment is still given this year.
Vaasa's court released Auer in 2011.
In that case, the right considered the possibility of an outsider to be sufficiently likely.
In his opening speech, Professor Kalle Kulmala told the prosecutor about the murder work and the circumstances that exclude the possibility of an outsider.
In our opinion, the crucial question is whether the house has become an outsider who has killed Jukka Lahti’s Anneli Auer in a way and time.
It's about the credibility of Anneli Auer's report,\" Kulmala said.
According to the prosecutor, he started a family dispute during which Auer had announced that he would leave home and seek divorce.
At some point, the kitchen was moved to the kitchen where Lahti was caught by Auer and tried to prevent this from leaving.
One of them took the kitchen knife, Kulmala described the events of the night of death on Monday.
According to the prosecutor, several factors prove that there was no external factor.
For example, emergency calls do not include sounds from an outsider.
The oldest child of the Auer said in the interview that he saw a man leaving the back room door.
The holiday sentence of Vaasa’s court in 2011 was partly based on the daughter’s report.
According to the prosecutor, the daughter's observation cannot be correct.
“The daughter didn’t see an outsider in the parents’ bedroom, even though she was there twice, she said.
The new witness of the prosecutor is about the possibility of an outsider.
Jukka S. Lahti's sister has told me about the events since the night of the murder in the hospital.
She said she only saw Lahti's body in the hospital when she was in the fireplace room.
Auer's defense is going to introduce legal investigation lines, the proportion of which, according to the defense, has not been sufficiently investigated by the police.
When Vaasa's court of court released Auer three years ago, the court held a cheap finding of a foreign man's DNA as a reference to an outsider.
The show later turned out to be the DNA of a scientist working at the Central Crime Police Laboratory.
At that time, a sample of 700 people was taken.
At the same time, a significant number of serious suspects and alternative investigation lines were excluded, Defense Attorney Juha Manner said.
Another of the new witnesses in defense is the possible external author.
The Uvilian woman told the police about a male of porridge who, according to the woman’s report, had acknowledged the act.
The police were questioning the man in the summer.
The prosecutor made a decision that the French man had nothing to do with the homicide.
A woman's prosecutor made a request for an investigation because the prosecutor suspects the woman's lie in her report.
The second of the new witnesses of defense is a nurse who worked at the central hospital of Satakunta on the night of the death.
The Supreme Court condemned the murder of Auer's life sentence in December.
According to the judgment of the Court of Justice, against the possibility of an outsider, the reports of the children of Auer, the lack of votes to an external factor, as well as the time required by the cost of the events, were fought.
The judgment came with a sound of 2-1.
A lesser judge wrote that conflicting evidence in the criminal case must be interpreted as the benefit of the accused.
That is why the daughter’s report must be interpreted as having, despite the contradictions of the report, found that the outsider had left the back room door.
The two oldest children of the Auer are called to be heard by the court of court.
The girl was first heard in person last year in the Supreme Court of the Port.
In court, he no longer remembered the events of the night of the murder.
The second oldest child of Auer named her mother a killer in a video interview in 2011.
The boy told me that he heard the events of the night of the murder behind the closed door.
He also told me that Auer planned to kill for six months.
The boy has no obligation as a lawyer to say anything in the court.
The court proceedings will continue today with the consultation of Anneli Auer.
The hearing of the sun will continue tomorrow, if necessary.
Annali Auer is currently in prison for more than seven years for sexual and violent crimes against children.
Should Putin be allowed to participate in the G20 meeting?
Putin's actions in Ukraine have made him a lot of first-rate enemies.
Putin is expected to attend the G20 Summit in Brisbane in November, and Australia will be delighted to discuss whether or not it should allow his entry.
Pussy Riot called on Australia to ban Putin's participation in a summit involving more than 4,000 of the world's most influential countries on a weekend.
“We don’t think this person has anything to do with the G20,\" Maria Alyokhina told the public about the full-packed opera house at the festival of Dangerous Ideas.
Kiev has warned us to be “a complete war on the brink” and Putin calls parts of Ukraine “Novorosian – a new Russia – so we need to welcome him?
Tony Abbott said: \"He's going to make a decision.\"
According to the director of the G20 unit at the Lowy Institute Research Centre, the Australians cannot decide who to attend the meeting, even though the meeting is held in the country.
“Austria can decide who to let it go to the country, but it’s an international meeting,” he says.
Just like in New York’s host of UN meetings or in Washington’s host of International Monetary Fund meetings, it’s not the father’s duty to ban someone from coming,\" Callaghan says.
In the last week, Tony Abbott said that he was going to push the decision, following the actions of the Russian protesters in Ukraine.
This is a very important question.
Since Putin is coming to a very important international meeting, Australia does not have the right to decide on it alone.
“But there’s an important thing in this regard that I’m going to weigh a lot, and I think that’s what other countries will do in the coming weeks,” he says.
People attend the anti-war meeting in Mariupoli, Eastern Ukraine.
The event lasts two days, with a wide range of representatives from the world’s largest and fastest-developed economies, with a total of about two-thirds of the world’s population, representing 85% of global GDP and 75% of international trade.
Members include Canada, China, France, Japan, Russia, the United States and the European Union, as well as a few separate guests from non-G20 countries such as New Zealand, Singapore and Myanmar.
According to Callaghan, Australia had a questionable task of balancing between different interests under high public pressure.
In his opinion, the best way to deal with this is to take advantage of the opportunity to pressure Russia to speak publicly about its recent actions.
“The Prime Minister should say that we are going to use this opportunity to seek a very open dialogue and that he will demand President Putin to make an account of his actions.
If Putin comes to the meeting, his duty is to give an explanation of his actions,\" Callaghan says.
There is clearly a rise in geopolitical pressures.
I think the world is waiting for them to talk about these things.
Russian rebels are preparing weapons to attack the bases of the Ukrainian army at Donetsk Airport in eastern Ukraine.
It is still unclear whether to attend Puti’s meeting, and according to Callaghan, this is not necessarily known until a few days in advance.
This must be the last thing in Putin's mind.
“I have to change my attitude towards Ukraine because I desperately want to go to Brisbane in November.
President Bill Shorten takes Putin’s approach to Australia’s income in a very reservations manner, but he understands that this is an international conference.
It is probably time for the Prime and Foreign Ministers to discuss with other countries and the G20s whether it is appropriate to allow Putin to enter Australia.
This is an international, not an Australian conference, I understand that.
Following the tragic events following the Malaysian Airlines disaster, as well as the lack of proper co-operation in terms of pity, responsibilities and air accidents, and now that thousands of Russian soldiers are on the border with Ukraine, I think that most Australians are very reservations about Putin’s welcome to Australia.
Germany's business world criticises – Unlicensive – Berlin
Some of Germany’s top managers warn that Germany has become “too confident” and “serious” because government policies threaten the country’s competitiveness.
The criticism against the Government of the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel happens at the same time as the largest economy in Europe shows signs of slowing down, causing concerns as to whether it is able to rotate economic growth in the still emerging euro area.
The criticism of corporate leaders is the result of the fiercely opposed political decisions by the German business sector, including the introduction of minimum wage and the calculation of the retirement age of certain long-term employees to 63 years.
“I think the biggest threat right now is excessive confidence in Germany, which inevitably causes a sense of self-sufficiency, according to sales figures, the world’s largest chemical manufacturer, Kurt Bock, said.
EU economy
He said: “In general, it is a feeling that we are doing well, we have money to use and unemployment at a relatively low level.
I think there is a great danger here.
The German government policy shows that we do not focus on growth and are not a favourable environment for businesses, but rather focus much more on sharing wealth and meeting the expectations of certain entities.
According to Markus Kerber, CEO of the German Industry Organisation, Germany’s situation is now good.
In the next ten years, however, every developed economy must change. ...[Germany] reform programme does not achieve as much progress as in previous years.
The National Chamber of Commerce DIHK has also expressed criticism of recent political developments.
Germany's unemployment has remained at a low level and the budget is almost balanced, even a slowdown in consumption.
However, the fall in GDP in the second quarter has highlighted the vulnerability of Germany to external shocks such as Russia and Ukraine.
GDP fell by 0.2% over the previous three months compared to the previous year.
Germany’s weakened performance threatens to make the ECB’s fight against low inflation even more difficult and could make a quantitative recovery more likely.
Kerber would like the government to return from public consumption to public investment, for example by focusing future consumption on infrastructure and not so on pensions.
Kerber believes that the Merkel government will destroy the fruit of his social-democratic predecessor Gerhard Schröder in the early 2000s with strict policies.
According to Stefan Heidbreder, CEO of the Stiftung Familienunternehmen Foundation for Family Enterprises, Germany’s situation remains good compared to other countries.
It is a thank you to businesses and not so much to government policy. . . . .
The example of neighbouring France has shown that the use of funds in social support and the restriction of the freedom to manage a company is a false way of doing so.
The leading German investment bank described the situation more directly, saying that recent decisions by the government are \"a disaster\".
Germany is threatening to lose everything it has done so much work to please voters.
This is my main concern right now, the banker says.
According to Bock, the energy reform of the new government coalition failed to resolve the fundamental weaknesses of the policy that have caused the cost of competitiveness to industry.
Ashton Kutcher handshake with music festivals, blocked access to the fan
The actor Ashton Kutcher participated in the Stagecoach kantrique music festival in Indio, California, where he was reported to have run into a tight fight with a security officer.
Ashton Kutcher is reported to have run into a fight with a security guard at the Kantri music festival.
Kutcher's fan tried to approach him on the backstage at the Stagecoach concert music festival in California, after which the situation came out of hand, the TMZ website says.
Kutcher was in VIP facilities when a young woman approached him to greet and care for him.
When the star of the male-series series went to greet the fans, an over-inspiring security guard went along and caused the witch.
The actor and the security guard ran into a hand-call, and Kutcher’s friends had to go in to arrest Kutcher, TMZ says.
After separation from his ex-wife, Demi Moore, Kutcher meets Mila Kunis, who, like Kutcher, is the star of the former 70s show.
The witch happened shortly after Angus T. Jones had practically been removed from the standard cast of the hit series after he published a video in which he calls the series \"roast\" and calls fans not to look at it.
The actor Ashton Kutcher participates in the Stage Coach Music Festival in California.
Angus T. Jones, \"Jake,\" calls the series \"roasty\" and calls people not to look at.
The Baltic bacteria killed a vacationer
Six people have been infected by bacteria from the Caribbean, a popular German tourist attraction.
One of the patients is in a coma.
Vibrio vulnificus is found in parts of the Baltic Sea and other regions of the world, but is mostly found in the Gulf of Mexico.
The bacteria spread most effectively in more than 20 degrees of breakthrough water.
“The bacteria can be found anywhere, as long as the conditions are correct, Dr. Heiko Will told The Local Health and Safety Agency (LAGuS) of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
Bacteria can be found in Denmark, Poland and along the coast of Germany.
According to LAGuS, the patient had been traveling on the island of Usedom at the end of July.
He died at the beginning of August.
The second pensioner has been in a coma for three weeks, and it is possible that his feet should be shot.
He went swimming near Ahrensopia with a small wound on his feet.
The sick man went to the hospital after he found out on his way home that his feet had become blue.
Doctors reported a blood poisoning caused by Vibrio vulnificus in the leg.
“My husband would not have spent time in the Baltic Sea, if he had known about the danger, the sick wife Sonja Bruehl told Ossee Zeitung.
Serious illness and damage to the patient and his or her family could have been avoided if the information had been better available. For example, the wallet could have been made available on the subject.
LAGuS told the Dpa news agency that doctors have been asked to have the next infection at the beginning of the summer, but no official newsletter was issued.
Cool temperatures have resulted in a lower risk of bacterial disease.
“The results of the test showed that the strain of V. vulnificus has decreased significantly,” says Dr. Will.
The cool weather has worked.
Vibrio vulgarus, a relative of the cholera-causing bacteria, is especially dangerous if a person has a chronic liver disease and a weakened immune response such as HIV or diabetes patients and elderly people.
The risk of men suffering is greater than that of women, because estrogen has been observed as a protective pathogen.
If the bacteria get sick, it causes blood poisoning and sepsis.
The likelihood of death of the disease is about 25% after the bacterium has been infected.
V. vulnificus can also be infected by eating contaminated marines, although Dr. Will said in these cases this is not an infectious matter.
Food pollution from the sea is more common in the southern hemisphere.
In Germany, V. vulnificus caused poisoning the last time in 2010, when two people died from it.
Vieno Kekkonen: Breast removed due to cancer withdrawal
A 80-year-old singer, Vieno Kekkonen, plays and works hard, but has also had to be afraid of her health.
It is incredible that the radiant Vieno Kekkonen is 80 years old.
He is also surprised at how many years of age can suddenly be so much.
I didn't realize I was so old.
For 80 years, it sounds like a lot, Vieno Kekkonen laughs.
On his birthday, Vieno Kekkonen spends with his family.
At the end of the film, a birthday party was held for him by the folk music and pension association in Karttula, where he lived his childhood.
We were on the stage of Kekkola, the same place my grandfather was born.
I was confused about the celebration, the birthday hero tells me about the event where the stage measured for the three hundred was full of congratulations.
A few days later, the Muhotus was gathered to greet Armi Kuusela, whose life Vieno Kekkonen remembers being followed as a young person.
And now we're both of this age!
Vieno Kekkonen laughs.
During his long career, there are only a few aspects that have not been seen in the public.
One thing he has never said before: 2006 was removed from his second breast.
In my chest, there was a unclear finding at a point where it was decided to be completely removed.
It was not cancer, of course, where I was happy.
The same surgery made a new breast, so it was a pretty big deal.
Vieno Kekkonen has not thought that he lost his breast in a way that was unnecessary, for the knowledge of the unclear discovery would have been heavy to carry and cannot be overlooked.
I was just so relieved when there was nothing serious about it, Vieno Kekkonen says and points out that the loss of his chest to younger people is definitely more difficult.

The farmer is made responsible for the state of the sea
The debate on the weak condition of the Baltic Sea and its link to Finnish agriculture is depressive.
The voices of experts have been lost in politically sought-after opinions.
In particular, Helsingin Sanomat and Yle have, during the summer, shared agricultural responsibility for nutrient emissions to the Baltic Sea.
The same breath has been required to take rapid steps to control emissions.
The average farmer seems to be a few environmental researchers and, with their help, to the suppliers who are familiar with the issue compared to the over-the-counter nutrition expert.
The farmer knows that nutrients cannot come from cultivation if the same amount of nutrients have been sown in the field as it is repaired with the crop.
Almost all farms in Finland are committed to the environmental programme.
It strictly limits the use of fertilizers and requires accurate monitoring and reporting of nutrient balance.
The authorities monitor compliance with the conditions.
The nutrients stored in the field have been flushed into the water bodies even after the discharge restrictions, but there has been a clear reduction in emissions for many years.
Farmers have the desire and willingness to continue to work to reduce their nutrient emissions.
However, everyone should understand that zero access is impossible.
“If we want to have an almost equivalent amount of agricultural production, it is only acceptable that this is the case, says Jyrki Akkula, Director of Environmental Research at MTT (MT 29.8).
The summer of the summer brought large blues to the Gulf of Finland.
The researchers were very united that the rest gained its growth power from the sea’s own phosphorus stocks.
Phosphorus stored on the bottom of the sea is a part of the past decades of coastal agriculture, but it does not explain the stock alone.
The waste water treatment of cities growing on the shores of the Baltic Sea was on the ground until the end of the 19th century.
The problem was also about high-helsing waste water, and they were not seen as a problem as a result of pollution on their beaches.
The pollution of the beaches was prevented by building a waste water pipe on the open sea in the 1980s.
The water quality has improved over the years.
The nutrients that have ended up in the sea will not be removed from it, even if the agricultural sector is completely removed from Finland.
However, every single blue debate and accusations made are always directed at agriculture today.
The public debate is the responsibility of the farmer for the situation in the Baltic Sea.
The guilt is unreasonable, but it becomes increasingly difficult when it is used to carry out political passions.
Greens are driving their presidents, Minister of the Environment Ville Niinistö, leading to major changes in agricultural environmental standards.
As a pop board, Niinistö has used summer rest.
In my very words, the Niinistö has accused the producers of MKK of old-fashionedness and considered it the most difficult barrier to water protection.
There should be a border on political rhetoric.
Most of the specific projects for water protection are based on cooperation between the OCT, farmers and environmental management.
The Niinistö attacking style serves more fishing for city greens than water protection.
I guess that's what I'm talking about.
With hard speech, the greens are preparing to leave the government.
In policy changes, it is the task of the MKK to ensure the livelihood of its members.
It is difficult to trade expensive changes to farmers unless they find a replacement for their costs.
The only money Ville Niinistö has made is cuts from other agricultural funds.
The repeal of the mine tax does not go through: Palmer
The last attempt by the Government of Abbott to throw the mining tax into the garbage basket seems to have been destroyed, since Clive Palmer has declared that his senators reject it without any changes.
The Australian Labour Party is also afraid that the Government has included a rule in the new initiative to limit the increase in employers' contributions to compulsory pension payments up to 2034.
The government took advantage of a qualified majority in the House of Parliament on Monday to rush through the process of repealing the general confusion in its power and in the face of a clear misconception of the Labour Party.
It set aside the original cancellation initiative, which the Senate had previously made significant changes, and replaced it with a new bill, which it described, above all, relating to taxes, pension contributions, social security and family social assistance.
In the first place, this was an initiative aimed at abolishing the \"unfortunate\" mining tax and other decisions, such as a low-income pension fee (€3.6 billion savings), a pay-out bonus (€1.3 billion) and a bonus (€4.7 billion) for school-age children.
The president of the Palmer United Party (PUP) Clive Palmer did not accept the government's transfer.
“The planned abolition of the mining tax initiative is not accepted in the Senate without a low-income pension payment, a pay-out bonus and a bonus for children of school age, he tweeted.
The Government needs the support of independent parties such as PUP to ensure that the Labour Party and the Greens do not object to the initiative in the Senate.
Minister of Finance Chris Bowe accused the government of trying to eliminate Parliament’s power to decide on the mandatory amount of pension contributions, giving the Minister of Finance all the decision-making powers.
\"This is unprecedented,\" he told reporters in Canberra.
In this way, the government could delay other additions, in which case, the target of 12% of the guarantee for pension contributions to the Labour Party would be transferred up to 2034.
“It is not acceptable in any way, and the Labour Party will, of course, be opposed by all means,” Bowen said.
The guarantee is now 9.5%, but the government wants to give the Minister of Finance the power to decide to stop future additions.
Man's body found on Brighton's swimming beach
Sussex police applied for an unidentified man's body before two o'clock in the afternoon, and the police shut down the area near the beginning of the Volk's Electric Railway tourist attraction.
The police and the prosecutor are working to find out the conditions under which the body was taken to the beach.
The man has not yet been identified.
Scientists are going through a list of missing persons to find out if missing persons are in contact with the body.
The police were not yet able to confirm whether death occurred in suspicious circumstances.
According to the Mexican police, with an accidental explosion at the border, one death victim
According to the Piedras Negras police, the explosion in the customs building at the border of Mexico and the United States caused the death of one woman and the injury of five other people.
Felix Alberto Lopez Arenas is an operational director of the local police at the Texas border.
He told Associated Press news agency that a woman who died in a Sunday explosion had skull damage and five others got burns.
According to Lopez Arenas, the explosion occurred in the morning in the nights of customs officials.
The cause of the explosion is currently being investigated, but the authorities believe that the gas generated by the explosion has been collected.
The explosion didn't affect border control.
Three Atlantic City Casinos Closes in September
Three Atlantic City Casinos Close Their Doors This Month
The male customer plays in the Showboat casino, which is scheduled to close their doors, Atlantic City, N.J., 29.7.2014
It is expected to be a difficult month for Atlantic City when three casinos share their last cards on the table.
Three casinos close their doors this month in Atlantic City in the state of New Jersey, which means that this neo-lighted subway, known as the cinema of money machines, can no longer count on the revenue of the game.
More than 5,000 employees are unemployed in closing Showboat and Revel casinos this weekend, the Associated Press news agency said.
There will be more unemployment when Trump Plaza turns off its light.
The three casinos, one of which had only been able to operate for two years, were expected to close the city’s last disaster after the end of the Atlantic Club’s story only eight months earlier.
By the end of September, more than 25% of the city’s casino workers, 8,000 people, will be unemployed, the New York Times will write.
When gambling was allowed in New Jersey in 1976, casinos were advertised as a sure choice for a poor-economic Atlantic City, the AP news agency wrote.
However, the local gambling industry has gained a lot more competitors when casinos in New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania read much of Atlantic City’s once-in-a-kind casino deals.
Even before, Massachusetts is looking at its share of the money by welcoming three casinos to the state.
TVO: Areva’s new schedule is difficult to accept
According to the Industrial Power (TVO), it is difficult to accept the new assessment by the plant supplier Areva, according to which Olkiluoto’s triple reactor will only be commercially used in 2018.
According to Jouni Silvennoinen, the head of the power plant project, this is, among other things, due to the fact that construction works are already largely ready and the number of work between them is known.
TVO will continue to evaluate the information received from the Republic of Armenia.
Silvennoinen states that TVO welcomes all initiatives to accelerate the project.
Today, Areva submitted to TVO an updated schedule of Olkiluoto 3, according to which the construction works of the three-receptor will be completed in mid-2016 and commercial activities could start in 2018.
According to Areva, the recent delays in the project have mainly led to the approval of reactor automation systems, which was received in April.
This was preceded by four years of negotiations with TVO.
Olkiluto 3 was originally completed in 2009, but the schedule has been postponed once and for all.
TVO and Areva have been arguing for years about who is responsible for the delay.
The dispute is raised in the arbitration court, in which Areva has called for compensation of EUR 2.7 billion from the TVO.
TVO, on the other hand, considers Areva’s requirements unsubstantiated and requires about EUR 1.8 billion from the company.
Cooperation between energy and water actors is needed in the face of global challenges
International leaders gathered today within the 24th International Water Week in Stockholm. They urged energy and water actors to work together to meet the greatest challenges of our time to ensure an increasing population of water and energy production.
The theme of the 2014 Water Week is Energy and Water.
Water and energy are very often interdependent.
Energy is needed for pumping, storing, transporting and cleaning water, and water is needed for almost all energy production.
If one of these increases or decreases, it will immediately affect another.
These two funds are also an integral part of sustainable development, and they must always be kept in mind when making global decisions.
President of the Stockholm International Water Institute, Torgny Holmgren, who organized the water week, said in the opening of the water week that the challenges are enormous.
Global water consumption is expected to increase by 55% between 2000 and 2050, and energy consumption is expected to increase by 50% over the next two decades, and there is therefore a urgent need for closer cooperation between energy and water operators to find solutions to enable all the peoples of the world to flourish.
This year’s Water Prize winner, Professor John Briscoe, described water as a basis for growth, which both society as a whole and other sectors need. Briscoe said that “the developing countries face major challenges.
They need to mobilize these funds.
Briscoe added that there is no permanent solution to the water crisis.
Instead, there are challenges and solutions that form a chain.
During the week, representatives will discuss the ongoing and future work and cooperation of energy and water operators during more than one hundred seminars, workshops and events.
Originally, Professor John Briscoe from South Africa receives the Stockholm Water Prize from His Majesty, King Charles XVI of Sweden, at the ceremony on Thursday 4 September at the Stockholm City Hall.
The Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) is a research centre that provides research information and information to decision-makers so that they can make decisions that are sensible for water and sustainable development.
Flying home to the dead foreign bodies in Miami: Cost of flying bodies
In October 2012, 23 ships carrying Cuban refugees to Miami fell and 14 people were reported dead.
The same has happened to hundreds of times before, and this was certainly not the last of its quality.
Every year more than 1,000 migrants die trying illegally to cross the U.S. border.
Because of the first city, we are ready to die.
However, it is ironic that after reaching the first city in the country, it rarely plans to stay there until its last breath.
For many, this city is a temporary place of residence: either asylum, effort board up or an up-to-date place of stay while waiting for a better chance.
Few people think they're going to die there, and as death approaches, many plan to return to their homeland.
In the most popular cities of the immigrants, an disproportionate number of people born abroad and temporarily residing in the country, and in them death and restoration of the country are constantly working.
It is estimated that 20% of the bodies of the dead in South Florida are flown elsewhere. The number is more than anywhere else in the United States.
Most of the human remains (HR, short form of professional slang about human remains) are flown to the home country from the Miami International Airport.
Since 1964, according to Pierson, the largest company in the industry, the CEO, about 80% of this traffic travels abroad. The company flies bodies to several destinations in the Middle and South America, as well as to several European countries.

The more immigrants change to popular cities, the more they die there.
Even after death, homecoming has its cost.
Miami is the main airport of American Airlines for Latin American flights, and the figures describe the airline’s population of flights to its home country in 2013.
The return of the bodies to the home country is not cheap: prices can vary from five hundred to thousands of dollars.
The religious, cultural and general health requirements relating to the flight and delivery of human waste are also varied.
The colonial communities of the most popular cities sometimes organize funeral communities to help in the cost, because the restoration of bodies is expensive, the government does not help in the process, and the dead are often young people who do not have insurance.
A few credit institutions and informal health insurance programmes have been born in the past from such communities that were founded by Italian, Jewish and Greek groups living in New York, the United States.
The new generations of Mexicans, Chinese, Filipinos and Bangladeshi immigrants are now functioning in many of their preferred cities.

Death abroad is always causing difficulties, as few foreigners are planning to make their last resorts out of the migrant city.
In Dubai, for example, without a testament for foreigners who died, Sharia’s law is respected, even though the laws on the recovery of the deceased homeland are different.
The whole property of the deceased shall be frozen, after which it shall be distributed in accordance with the decision of the Sharia Court.
Aer Lingus (
2013) The scale reflects the multicultural demographic structure of the city and of the Irish people.
The airline interrupted the service, but re-opened it in 2004, after receiving negative feedback from those who moved from the country.
The idea of death is rarely present when a person travels through the popular city of migrants or when he resides there.
On the contrary, a temporary or permanent move to the migrant city is an open declaration of the migrant’s way of looking at life, not death.
Death in a migrant city abroad, however, means making the most powerful and irrevocable decisions of the migrant – whether they want to belong to the local or global community, the universe or the country, the short-term or forever.
The Centre and the Left make an interdependence issue
The opposition parties from the centre and the left are going to ask the government an interim question of low-income living and increasing inequality.
The parties want to raise the debate on the problems of people's livelihoods, which are exacerbated by poor economic development and worsening unemployment.
Increasing inequalities can also be seen between the different parts of the country and within large cities, the parties note when they are informed.
In the next year’s budget, cuts and increases in taxes are directed at small incomes, such as students, unemployed and pensioners, families and regular employment, while, among other things, food, medicines and housing are still rising.
In fact, nearly half a million people are already unemployed, the parties say when they are informed.
The problems of living at work have also been aggravated.
The central and left-wing parliamentary groups will discuss this issue on Thursday.
The third opposition party’s basic Finns have previously announced that they have left the interdependence issue on the resources of police and internal security.
The sitting of the Parliament will begin tomorrow Tuesday.
New York City West Indian Day is about to begin
The Caribbean culture is once again entering the light-screen in New York City, where the West Indian Day Parade is one of the biggest outdoor events of the year, and there are also politicians who see and see each other.
The annual parade will be held on Monday in Brooklyn.
It delights in the traditional carnivals that precede the fasting period, and some of them are dancers who carry complex, often made of feathers.
Eric Adams, President of the Brooklyn region, is the festival of this year, but there are also many other known faces to be expected.
The parade is a great opportunity for current and candidate politicians to welcome the public a week before the elections.
Despite the celebrations, the end of the parade has also been a part of violence in previous years.
The police have said that they are trying to keep the event safe through additional measures, e.g. by monitoring the activities of nearby gangs.
Is it worth asking rhetorical questions?
Everyone knows rhetorical questions, right?
That question should not be answered.
This language picture, i.e. a question that is not expected to be answered, but which suggests in a direction of a particular answer, tastes both high-flying speeches and more everyday words.
Ciceron's famous Catilina's first words are chain rhetorical questions, the first of which is, \"How long, O Catilina, you're going to use our patience.\"
The same applies to my wife's questions: \"Why shouldn't I warm up five days of old chicken for children?
Why are you so tight?
The difference is a better word for a rhetorical question.
The power of the rhetorical question lies in the fact that the question is open and the public is encouraged to accept the question.
The mysterious rhetorical question suggests that no one could agree on that.
In the 19th century, David Williams, the author of the material writing guide, described the rhetoric as “one of the well-appointed words designed to produce a powerful feeling of truth about a subject, and at the same time, the challenge posed by them is impossible to disagree.
Skills of Demand
Retorial questions can be asked after all if you want to achieve more ambitious goals.
Several subsequent rhetorical questions designed to express grief or anxiety are called epilepsy.
For example, Job uses them to appeal to the Almighty: “What do you benefit from being oppressed by me?”
Do you have the same eyes as us?
Do you see the same way a man sees?
The chains of rhetorical questions can also be found in my wife’s comments: “Why did you cause food poisoning for children?
Are you crazy?
Can't you do something right?
In addition, there is also a so-called hypofora, which is about when the question is asked and answered immediately.
Isaac Hayes is an excellent example of this: “Who is the black private egg that is a sex fear for all women?
Parru!
True mooses!
Who would sacrifice his life for his brother?
More examples of my wife: “What is the only food that children have eaten and where they could have become sick?
This chicken.
Who gave it to them?
You.
Strangely yes, the rhetorical question does not usually try to bend, even though rhetoric means the skill of bending.
If you’re trying to talk to someone around you instead of trying to preach to those who have already been converted, or you’d be tempted to take advantage of someone’s self-esteem, you should use rhetorical questions in a saving way.
They are more useful when trying to reconcile opinions than trying to get another to accept your opinion.
If the public agrees with the claim, “But it is not nice to have so sunny out there, the rhetorical question tells us that the speaker is sure of what he claims, which binds the speaker and the public better together.
However, this happens only if the speaker is sure that there are no differing opinions.
By assuming that consensus has been reached instead of seeking consensus, the speaker can be influenced, well, by self-sacrifice.
In other situations, the rhetorical question refers to the weakness of argumentation.
In the titles of the journal, the rhetorical question is too often the strongest possible argument in a very weak case: \"Whether the space creatures of pyramids were building,\" he said.
In both cases, the risk is that the question may lead to a response that differs from the suggested answer.
“Do you think the same as us? was part of the United Kingdom’s conservative campaign statement in general elections in 2005.
The party's gone.
For some of these cases, there has been a hobby, and so-called QTWAIN questions (the concept of the British journalist John Rentoul known as Questionions To What Answer Is No, questions whose answer is not) are popular.
A few years ago, a friend of mine held a competition looking for the best examples.
The competition was clearly won by Do You Wanta Be In My Gang, which was sang by pop star Gary Glitter before he became a child's sexual abuser.
The author also wrote the book ‘You Talk’ to Me’
Researcher: The time of the federal compromise may be over
At the beginning of the conflict in many countries, it was thought that the federal government could have some kind of compromise in the conflict, Saari says.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier in a Russian channel interview that getting peace to East Ukraine requires discussions on the status of the region.
In practice, this would mean some form of self-government in East Ukraine.
According to Putin, it would protect the legal rights of the East residents.
According to Saaren, Ukraine's transformation into a federal state is a priority for the Russian targets.
Ukraine is sure to suspect that Russia would seek to influence Ukraine's internal policy through it, he said.
If the federal solution is not reached, the second option could be some kind of frozen conflict from the Russian point of view, where Russia would effectively control Luhansk and Donetsk, Saari estimated.
West and Ukraine have accused Russia of sending weapons and soldiers to the east.
Russia has denied claims, although, for example, Russian-minded rebels themselves have said that their troops have fought for volunteer Russian soldiers.
Head of Up: An influential task designed for Katais
Tiltikainen reminds me that the image is new and still evolving.
In his opinion, Katainen, in some way, coordinated or even led the Commission's work on competitiveness and employment.
Of course, one of the priorities of the new Commission programme is the competitiveness and employment of the Union.
In this way, we are at the heart of the Commission's power, Tiilikainen says.
He believes that the background, economic competence and role of Kataiinen during the economic crisis will give him the opportunity to play a good role within the Commission.
According to the plans, the task would be seamless, i.e. Katas does not have its own DG under his control.
Instead, Katainen should be a team leader in the EU's competitiveness and employment sector, which would allow him to have portfolios in addition to other sectors to be coordinated.
In practice, leadership of the team could mean planning and guidance, for example.
Soldiers' mothers: up to 15,000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine
According to the Russian Soldiers' Mothers in Ukraine, up to 15,000 Russian soldiers have been sent to Ukraine over the past two months, and there are currently more than 7,000 Russian soldiers in the country.
According to human rights organizations, at least 200 Russian soldiers have died.
According to the organization, the city hospital in Rostov, near the border of Ukraine, has been wounded in the Ukrainian war.
The soldiers' mothers collect their information from the soldiers' family.
NATO has estimated that there are more than one thousand Russian soldiers in Ukraine.
B.B.-Andte's alcohol consumption: \"After drinking, there's a thing to do.
Big Brother Jussi and Andte started thinking about the life of the BB house on Monday night.
Jussi, on the side of the basement, walked on the ground on Monday night with a fitness bike with Andte, belonging to the apartments of Kartano.
The two were wondering what they were doing in the opinion of the programme viewers.
Not until you've seen it, Andte said.
In my opinion, most of the time in the BB house is waiting and spending time.
Possible holidays or tasks make up only a fraction of the BB house’s life.
More of it is expected and wonder and talk and live.
Andte, Anne and Jussi.
The people of the Cartano spent the evening on a wet night, and alcohol was especially turned on to Andte’s phone.
Jussi asked Andtel if the party had made a man’s life in the house more meaningful now that he had arrived in a small hippopotamus to discuss them with other residents.
A little drink, then there will be a case, Andte admitted.
See Andte interview on ISTV video!
Anna Abreu reveals her body experiences in Me Women
Anna Abreu says she decided to lose weight two years ago when she left for the gig.
At that time, the tired Anna thought she would gain more energy with weight loss.
Fred Montana / Slash News
Give me a dream about Victoria's Secret models a couple of years ago.
My body was Victoria's Secret style.
I wanted to look good and I thought I wanted to lose weight, and Anna tells the magazine.
Anna, who performs her body with gigs and music videos, says that there is no gypsy queen, even though she is named as such.
Vina Kõtöjoki
At Timm, Anna trained in gym and had a boxing.
The visible muscles are not important to me, but the fact that I get a certain amount of weight on the floor, Anna points out.
Sometimes the pop star gives itself permission to shine.
If I'm sensitive, I'm really sensitive.
Sometimes I pull unhealthy nights, and I don't think about more pounds.
Instead, I wonder what my body thinks.
I hate it if I do something bad for my body.

Corporate profit distribution pleases shareholders but does not increase growth
Are Australia’s stock exchange managers just trying to please a large group by accepting shareholders’ wishes for a larger distribution of profits and buying back their shares?
Is the decision-making power to move from corporate governments to shareholders that the government serves?
The profit distribution is the most important one, it was revealed last week at the end of the reporting period 2014.
The prices of companies’ shares that have rewarded investors in the form of buy-back programmes and by sharing more profits have increased clearly.
And there's nothing wrong with it.
However, the reverse side of the coin is that the consumption of capital is reduced faster than analysts have predicted. This is the case for many to ask whether the popularity of the short-term is too high and whether the focus is on the growth of the near future and the long-term.
Some companies, of course, repay money to shareholders and finance business by other means.
For example, more funding is obtained from low stock markets.
From a company’s point of view, this is reasonable because the loan is currently cheap, while there is no capital.
Although the funds acquired from the loan market are not taken into account, it is clear, however, that the openness to shareholders is primarily financed by the fact that the company spends less money on investing.
The net result of the wave of this purchase programmes (and the withdrawal of the profit and investment plans) is the decrease in capital on the Australian market.
Credit Suisse calls for this reporting period for the period of the loss of capital, during which companies have tried to keep the number of shares down.
As part of the same plan, companies have less and less capital.
At the end of the reporting period, the value of the buy-back programmes was $3.7 billion and the value of the expected, unexpected capital procurement programmes was 1.5 billion.
Credit Suisse has gone so far as to keep capital consumption as a curse in one of the titles of his report.
Although we now have figures that confirm that such a trend exists, informal evidence has already existed for months.
Glenn Stevens, head of the Australian Central Bank, had to point out a few weeks ago that companies needed a little more fighting to increase their investment.
Stevens are not concerned by the prospects of individual companies, but by the overall impact on the economy, as slow capital consumption generally leads to negative consequences for economic growth and employment.
Credit Suisse says that, on average, the own estimates of the consumption of their capital by reporting companies have decreased by four per cent over the last two years.
Estimates of the amount of free cash flow have risen by an average of 2%.
Improving cash flow is likely to increase capital consumption.
This rapid look seems good from the point of view of current shareholders and stock markets, but it is also some kind of proof of corporate obedience.
If I had a coin every time the CEO has said that the price of the stock is not important, I would... well, the end of the sentence is easy to guess.
Of course, this argument is not correct.
The CEOs closely monitor the prices of the shares and are very concerned about price fluctuations.
The short and long-term bonus packages of suppliers are defined according to the value of the shares, and the position of the managers depends on it.
The CEOs want to say that some decisions (whether they are corporate transactions, increased investment in the organization or profit distribution) are not always immediately popular, but they are useful for the medium-term strategy.
In fact, corporate leaders often complain of the fact that the investment market has a very short-sighted approach.
That is why the current Conservatives’ hips seem to be accepting short-term goals.
However, those who assess the low share market and support the saving of capital do not have this concern. However, it was too clear at the very end of the reporting period that the weight was to reduce the consumption of future capital, and the most saving companies were praised.
Large mining companies, such as BHP and Rio Tinto, kept the number one for reducing the consumption of capital, but many other companies also function the same – part of the obligation and part because they feared the reaction of shareholders.
Why do investors put pressure on companies to share profits?
According to the Credit Suisse Strategy, it is clear that shareholders want more income, as the profits of other, more traditional fixed-value investment products have decreased as the central banks suddenly dropped interest rates worldwide to bring more money to the market.
In this way, investors are forced to look for profits in the capital market, and in turn, they pressure companies to share more profits.
Shareholders have also made it quite clear to companies that they are not willing to invest in high-risk companies whose profit distribution is uncertain.
Investors prefer money as more and more investors approach retirement age.
The statistics of the previous reporting period clearly show that the distribution of profits had a significant impact on the cost cuts of companies and not on the increase in net sales.
The leaking of public images seems to be a piece of information or a break in an email account.
According to Jennifer Lawrence's images and some sources, the unknown hacker who leaked videos to the internet is amazed by information security experts and Apple.
Although the hacker has published lists of women-side publicity people in a chatroom and said he has more pictures of women, some of them have reported that their images are counterfeited, while others have said that it was a long time ago about the pictures removed.
The pictures are a lot and have been mentioned as Jennifer Lawrence, Jenny McCarthy, Rihanna, Kate Upton and American actor Mary E Winstead.
After the hacking, the biggest question is what was done through the attack.
What about the pictures and videos, and where were they downloaded?
The most important source of the news for the images – an shameless and thorough attack on Apple iCloud service – is the most unlikely option.
Large companies such as Apple have invested in information security teams working inside the house, whose task is to try to penetrate the company’s own systems regularly.
“The large scale hacking of Apple’s iCloud service is unlikely.
Furthermore, the original publisher does not claim that the claim should be correct, points out Rik Ferguson, Vice President of the Information Security Research Unit of Trend Micro.
A simpler and more likely explanation for hackers associated with these public users (and for hackers that are less famous every day) is the leaking of an email address and password, either by guessing or using kads, i.e. by tricking a person to log in with a real-looking site, after which these data will be used against them.
Apple continues to investigate the alleged attack on the iCloud service used in iPhone phones to store settings and, above all, to backup images when transferred to the cloud server.
You can log in to the user's account by providing this email address and password, after which their image and other information can be downloaded from the account.
This can only be prevented if the account owner has introduced a two-step authentication - 2FA, i.e. additional protection against intrusion into the account, in which case the owner’s mobile phone will be sent code before the account can be logged.
However, it is rarely used for 2FA properties, either because it is not known, or because it is considered to be poor.
Apple continues to investigate whether all information is from its iCloud service, and if so, how extensively the accounts of users were penetrated.
The company has not delivered an opinion on this issue at the time of publication of the original version of this text.
Ferguson considers it possible that the hacker has used the “Do you forget the password – link in Apple iCloud” service by first collecting the e-mail addresses of the public, for example, in the address book of another hacked device.
It is also possible that celebrities have used the same password in several services, when passwords were hijacked through them.
Lawrence's images publisher claims that the pictures are real, but don't tell us when they were taken.
Winstead said in his tweet that this could be a long-term hacking company.
These pictures were removed a long time ago, so I can only imagine how long this took to be a rough effort.
I feel compassion for all others who are subject to hacking, he wrote in his tweet.
However, the independent security expert Graham Cluey points out that Winstead may have removed the photos from his mobile phone, but the removal of the image from the modern smartphone does not always mean that there are no copies of the image.
Modern smartphones regularly store images of cloud service because they often do not have space for a large number of images taken by the user.
Apple's iPhone standard setting is to save images to iCloud; Google Android uses Google+ and Microsoft's Windows phones to store images to OneDrive.
Independent service providers, such as Dropbox, provide automatic image and data storage service.
“People take and remove pictures, but don’t understand that images are being downloaded from an account,” says Cluley to The Guardian.
Ferguson agrees: \"No one always wants to be removed,\" he said.
Pictures and videos can be stored for years.
If someone accesss the user's email address and password, they can re-download all the photos and videos that have been sent by e-mail.
Apple service can be downloaded to Mac, Windows PC or any Apple device.
The hacker released a screenshot that was claimed to display videos and images taken from Windows PC that have not yet been published.
Two-stage identification protects from such hacking because it requires all who are trying to copy an existing account to another device, to enter the original user’s device, usually the code sent by the mobile phone.
Without the code, access to the account is blocked.
Both Apple, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo offer a two-step identification account, but it is not yet known whether these public users used the service, or how many of them used it.
Some have said that the pictures they claim to be in are not real.
Ariana Grande has said that the pictures that Grande claims to be in are “full counterfeited”
Victoria Justice wrote in her tweet: “I’m thinking the nudity pictures that are taken are a fake, you don’t understand.
Let me cut the roots off from the rumors right away.
Cluley brings out another option.
Since the hacking was aimed at the public, their accounts may have been broken by someone who handled their social media accounts or handled their email regularly.
“I would like to know if there are actors’ agencies or some representative involved in the matter, he thinks.
However, those persons in the public domain do not use one publisher or agency.
Another option is that someone who installed one or more systems of the victim of the security attack, or helped in its configuration, changed the secret system so that all data can be returned.
This happened in the case of Christopher Chaney of Florida, who received the name \"Hollywood Hacker\", where the hacker spread pictures of Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis's e-mail accounts in 2011, and was sentenced to 10 years in December 2012, he was also ordered to pay over $66,000 for damages.
Chaney was accused of entering more than 50 entertainment accounts between November 2010 and October 2011. In some cases, he asked Aguilera for images of the star in the name of this stylist and then published images online.
Chaney later apologized, saying that his actions were certainly one of the worst violations of privacy that can be imagined.
Chaney was also claimed to have established two people online for more than ten years.
According to Cluley, “Chaney’s case broke into the email accounts of stars, and they were changed so that someone sent their information forward even after the password was changed.
Cluley says that the obsessive activity of hackers breaking into these accounts - reminds the collection of butterflies -
They just want to collect such information.
In this case, it is possible that someone had encountered a list of information and login information in these accounts in services such as Dropbox.
Hackers have also been able to try to penetrate for a long time.
or they got access to someone's e-mail account information, such as the address book, and then fished other people's data.
I don't think it's a simple iCloud security hole.
Australia has offered its intelligence service to help the UN track 44 peacekeepers who were kidnapped by terrorists in Syria in connection with al-Qaeda.
The Terrorist Group Jabhat al-Nusra is believed to consider 44 Fijin peacekeepers captured. This terrorist group captured the crossing position in Golan's hills last week and forced UN forces to surrender.
Peacekeepers have been missing since the middle of the week, and their whereabouts are not known.
At the same time, ministers of the United Nations Conference on Small Developed Countries, including Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, are very concerned about what happened.
Bishop discussed the situation with UN Secretary-General Ban ki-Mon at the summit, and he has offered Australian assistance in order to save the missing peacekeepers.
“I am convinced that Australia will help the United Nations in everything he can, by providing intelligence assistance, for example,” he said to the AAP news service from Samoa on Monday.
We are very closely in touch with all the partners and friends of the intelligence network -- to ensure that we can locate them and that they are safe.
Bishop has already convinced the Prime Minister of Fiji Frank Bainimarama and the Minister of Foreign Affairs Ratu Inoke Kubuabola that Australia will use its position in the UN Security Council to monitor the situation.
At the same time, the Filipino peacekeeping group in their army armies was reported to have escaped in different parts of the same controversial region.
The United Nations has been monitoring Golan's hills since the outbreak of Syria and Israel in 1974.
Cheaters are trying to steal your money through the carbon tax abolition initiative, warning Australian Competition Authority ACCC
The attackers are using the carbon tax abolishing initiative to steal money, ACCC warns.
The SCAMwatch Unit of the Competition Authority has warned consumers and companies to rely on too good offers from government agencies that offer thousands of dollars of credit.
Cheaters may use the figures seen in the media to prove to the consumer how much he can save the goods when buying carbon tax after the abolition of the carbon tax, and offering it up to $7,000, the warning says.
They may sound very convincing because they have identified the personal information of the victim that they use to try to obtain bank information or try to get the victim to pay the fee.
They are discussing current topics to deceive the victim.
Cheaters use other than carbon tax fraud to get their hands on money. Their stories are more advanced, and they use current things to build a scam around them.
The MH370 lost aircraft and the death of Robin Williams have also inspired scammers on the flight of Malaysia Airlines.
The ACCC instructs the company to contact the company instead of the contact information provided by the caller by means of self-examined contact information, if there is no doubt about the identity of the player representing the company.
If you receive an unexpected call or an email from someone who claims to represent a government agency or company, such as an energy company, and that you are entitled to compensation due to the abolition of the carbon tax, please beware.
If you believe that you have been scammed and provided personal information or transferred money to a scammer account, please contact your bank immediately.
If the offer sounds too good to be true – for example, a free money shared by the government – it is likely to be.
Financial statements: Lipponen condemns the EU's Russian sanctions
Former Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen criticises the sanctions imposed on EU Russia in the interview of economic reports.
Russia's priority in politics is to give its own advantage.
There are no sanctions for this, Lipponen says in an interview.
Lipponen has started work as a business analyst of the Central Economic Union of the EEA Arctic regions.
He is concerned that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) suspended their Russian project funding as part of the EU's economic sanctions.
“This means, for example, that environmental projects of the northern dimension, which clearly have visions, go to the ice,” Lipponen said in an interview.
The freezing of funding is now hampering cooperation, which, according to Lipposen, could be difficult to rebuild if there is no trust.
However, he believes that the interest of Finnish companies in cooperation projects in the Arctic region continues to be as high as before.
He is currently preparing an EC study on the Arctic policy and the opportunities of companies in the north.
It does not affect the acute situation in Ukraine or the situation in Russia.
The report looks far ahead, let's talk about tens of years, he says.
It is rare for the norppa to come to a low-water or nearby institution, says Vesa Heinonen from the museum’s lecture centre.
In the summer of Vaasa, we saw Norppa swimming near the beach on Sunday.
Heinos says the norppa is likely to come after the summer meal.
It's not crazy.
This means there's fish in the area, Heinone's tip.
He said, for example, that the Sundom Bridge will be seen especially in the spring and autumn norppes, which will arrive just after the fish.
Norppa is not a common species in the Vaasa Sea Region.
You can see the norm on the payground at the villa representations, he will continue.
Norppia lives in the Gulf Sea and the Pacific Sea, among other things.
According to the South Austrian Court, the killed pizzeria-owner Robert Vallelonga behaved aggressively and violently outside the nightclub.
Murdered by South Australian pizzeriaist Robert Vallelon.
In the trial of the right, Robert Vallelonga, a pizzeriaist, acted aggressively towards both his partner and the security officer only minutes before he was killed outside the nightclub.
Lawyers who accused Vallelonga of murder asked Adelaide's lower court to release their customers against guarantees, because it was clearly about self-defense.
Marie Shaw, QC, said that the case is not serious enough to keep her client whose identity has not been published until the trial.
\"According to the evidence, the dead behaved aggressively that he had to be removed from the nightclub,\" he said.
After that, a jerk began, which led to that 40-year-old drunk man... tearing a security guard's shirt.
It is important to note that, according to the prosecutor, the death caused one shot, which clearly indicates self-defense or the defence of another.
A 25-year-old man is still accused of murder.
Vallelonga, 44, was found unconsciously near the cross between Rundle St and Synagogue Place at about 2.25 p.m. on May 4.
He died of injuries in the royal hospital of Adelaide the next day. Friends and pizzeria customers remained dying from the local legend of One Tree Hill.
According to the prosecutors, there was no cause for the murder, and after the incident, he had told the taxi driver, having put someone to sleep for a few days.
However, the camera video shows something else, Shaw says.
\"It confirms that the dead behaved aggressively -- his partner tried to calm him down and got his own share of hard and violent behavior,\" he said.
On the side of our client, there is both a presumption of innocence and evidence that he defended himself, which will be mentioned in court proceedings.
The prosecutors opposed the release of the man, because only one of the three security guards who had been present at night had intervened in the exercise of Vallelonga.
They said the other security guards didn't think he was threatening because he was short, and he used a big man's vocabulary store because he wanted to avoid physical confrontation.
They also said that the taxi driver saw the case clearly would prove that Vallelonga was hit with power and had no chance of defending himself.
Judge Elizabeth Sheppard ordered a man to be arrested until the next week, when he would declare his decision.
The controversial dolphin hunt began in Japan - based on tradition - foreign news - East Sanomat
The bad weather was expected to postpone in the world the beginning of a very bad hunt.
In the city of Taij, Japan, the annual dolphin hunting season started again on Monday.
It is expected to last until the end of February.
A great deal of opposition to the world’s hunting, among other things, is the British newspaper Guardian.
In the hunt, hunters drive hundreds of dolphins to the remote bay, where mammals are slaughtered after their group has chosen the most suitable individuals to be transported to dolphins and theme parks around the world.
The meat of dolphins also ends with food.
According to local authorities, the hunt was expected to begin due to the bad weather.
Information on the practice spread to the world in 2009 with a documentary titled The Cove.
During the previous hunting seasons, hunting has also been criticized by diplomats, not only by animal defenders.
According to the respondents, dolphin meat in any case has a limited market due to its high mercury content.
According to the people who defend hunting, including the Japanese government, this is a tradition.
Defenders have also reminded me that dolphins are not endangered.
Delphin hunting was already protested in several countries during the weekend.
According to the Protestants in Tokyo, Japan’s reputation was damaged in the world.
A protest was also held in Helsinki on Monday in front of the Japanese Embassy.
Some NATO member states are uncertain about investing new troops in Eastern Europe
In NATO, the views of the military union are divided into whether East Europe and the Baltics should set up NATO bases in response to the Ukrainian crisis, says the Financial Times.
Poland and Estonia have asked the military alliance to bring permanent troops to their countries, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been against the plan.
“Ukraine has given a new perspective on Russian politics, and it threatens to pour out European security,” said Michael Clarke Financial Times, director of the Royal United Services Institute in London.
NATO member states are coming together in the first week, and the military union is expected to publish its new contingency plan.
The key issue of the plan is whether NATO can break the TAE agreement on conventional weapons signed in 1990.
This is how the NATO and the Warsaw Federation invest armed forces in the area between the Atlantic and the Ural Mountains.
In practice, the agreement prevents the Financial Times from creating new military bases in Eastern Europe and the Baltics.
Russia itself frozen its participation in the agreement in 2007, but the country did not explicitly withdraw from the agreement.
Due to the tightening situation in Ukraine, NATO wonders whether the terms of the agreement still need to be respected.
“Nato’s resources must be available in all the NATO countries that need resources,” said Sir Malcolm Rifkind Financial Times, president of the British Parliament’s Security Committee.
Matt Guthmiller
When other teens learned to drive, Matt Guthmiller learned to fly.
The 19-year-old Guthmiller just flew around the youngest world – and even alone, reports the CBS News spokesman Carter Evans.
The young man in South Dakota flew 30,000 miles, stopping 23 times in 15 different countries in five different continents.
Guthmiller was treated as a rock star due to his record flight performance.
Guthmiller also heard critical comments:
“A little too risky – and – someone spoiled, a rich puppy just wants to see a little bit of the world and have fun...
Guthmiller did not have much to say to such comments.
Of course, I enjoyed a lot of fun, but it also included a lot of work, and I hope that with my record I will also inspire other people to go to the world and do big things.
Guthmiller's flight was started when he was young, and first he asked his parents to go to the airport cafes.
Later, he asked for flight hours.
My parents saved me for a short, $20-paying, 20-minute flight, but I think they're thinking that I'm gonna lose my enthusiasm.
No, he didn't.
Guthmiller made a deal with his parents to give him more time in the cab.
I agreed to share with my father the entire high schooler of the car instead of getting my own car.
At the exchange store, I could fly planes.
By the age of 17, Guthmiller had received a flight licence and two years later he leased a single-engine Beechcraft aircraft for his solo flight around the world.
A young man studying at the MIT High School took care of the plane itself and made fuel calculations.
Many hours in the top world also meant that he himself needed additional support.
Lots of caffeine and Ores.
Guthmiller says he has eaten a few inventives entirely during a long flight.
Flying to the clouds was both amazing and frightening.
In other countries, air traffic controllers had no control over how they could have helped them navigate the storms.
I had no idea which clouds were just a little above the plane and which of them reached the height of 45,000 feet and teared the plane into pieces.
Guthmiller's plane was not pressurized and had no oxygen reserve, so he couldn't fly above the clouds.
The amount of fuel would not have been higher.
On the day after the interview, another young pilot, 17-year-old Haris Suleman, died of his plane falling between Samoa and Hawaii, which Guthmiller calls his trip the hardest part of his trip.
Guthmiller flew from the same airport as Suleman, and he feels that the rise is technically challenging due to the high fuel required for 16 hours of flight.
Despite the risks and even the high location of the mess Guthmiller, Guthmiller managed to break the record and collect money for the ATM training through the Code.org website.
He is a coder himself, and founded his own company at the age of 12 years.
Guthmiller's goals are here in the sky.
It would be great to set up the next Apple, but let's see how it works.
In any case, Guthmiller is going to go high.
Focus on the sky and you can achieve something great.
Finding the right franchise entrepreneur is harder than I think.
Lori Joyce was excited to join the fans in his Cuptakes by Heather and Lori stores around Canada after the Canadian W TV channel began to show The Cuptake Girls-tosi-tv program in 2009.
The innovation continued until it became clear that one franchise entrepreneur was not suitable for the task.
“My French entrepreneur sat in his car and called me that a hundred potential customers would line up outside the store to buy a cup of cake, and he can’t stand the situation,” said Joyce.
This event opened my eyes because it was a huge lost opportunity for us.
After the incident, Joyce decided to change the selection process of franchise partners from the beginning to stress the management skills of the company's culture rather than the bakery skills.
“Whoever can shine in the interview -- they know what I want to hear, he says, adding that he has had about a hundred interviews with each of the 11 franchise movements.
We start with six weeks of training, but employees work in a completely different way in the working environment, so the whole process is quite difficult. Therefore, education emphasizes, above all, the compatibility of business culture.
Finding the right franchise entrepreneur is vital to the development of any small company.
A strong and honest leader can shape and grow an organization, while a poorly qualified leader can cause costly damage to the company.
“Before I thought that looking for a franchise entrepreneur was like going on a date, but it doesn’t hold up at all, you can do a lot to get to know another before you get married,” Joyce says.
Instead, in the case of a franchise partner, a contract is signed, a guarantee is obtained and a new store is built.
Getting involved with someone before you see how a person works is a huge step and a significant test of trust.
The symbiotic relationship between the Franchise parties resembles a strong marriage, as they have common goals, explains Lorraine McLachlan, President and CEO of the Canadian Franchise Association (CFA).
That is why McLachlan also believes that the franchise entrepreneur should be careful when choosing a future franchiser before taking up such a long-term partnership.
“This is the same idea as human relationships: if a dating partner is rude already on a date, imagine what he is married, he says.
It is equally important for both parties to choose carefully and evaluate the future contract partner and pay attention to the smallest alarm marks on both sides.
McLachlan adds that franchise teachers such as Joyce can learn about past successes and mistakes, but for the first time, the franchise givers must be more careful when choosing the first, most important partners.
The new franchise donors, on the other hand, must conclude on the basis of a supposedly successful parent company, the challenges they have faced and the skills the new franchise entrepreneur needs when faced with similar difficulties.
For the first time, companies operating as franchise donors may also request the help of a franchise advisor to create a profile based on industry practices.
McLachlan also reminds us that for the first time as franchise donors and entrepreneurs, there is a lot of help available on the CFA website at lokforafranchise.ca.
However, the process becomes easier later because franchise teachers learn to better evaluate potential entrepreneurs, but also because the first franchise entrepreneurs can provide advice and help in the evaluation.
“The first franchise partner’s contribution helped Brian (Scudamore, 1-800-GOT-JUNK? company founder and CEO) significantly in creating this business and franchise system,” says Erik Church, O2E Brands. O2E Brands, including companies 1-800-GOT-JUNK?, You Move Me and Wow 1 Day Painting.
Franchise entrepreneurs helped Brian create something that he could not have created alone, so the first franchise entrepreneurs have to choose this idea in mind.
Under the Church there are 216 franchise entrepreneurs representing all three brands of O2E, and he is also a partner of Toronto franchise of You Move Me.
The method of Chhruch to find the right franchise partner is simple.
“Will I ask myself this person at the weekend’s barbecue party?” he said.
If the answer to this question is 'n', you probably don't want to spend much of your working days looking for solutions with them to major corporate challenges.
In addition, the Church notes that the O2E Brands company is largely grateful for its success in the franchise.
In the corporate organization, managers often see their position as a short-term and a lower level of management, while franchise entrepreneurs engage in a partnership with long-term objectives and are thus more committed to the company’s success.
“Franchise partnership has a lot more good aspects than traditional business building, but the partnership is also much more intense,” he said.
This is a partnership, not a relationship between the Vice-President and the local operational manager.
Such a partnership is more difficult, but well managed, it produces better results.
Rail delayes lower grain prices in North America
Delayed rail transport has led to a significant fall in grain prices in the Northeast of the United States, weeks before a huge harvest is expected to be placed under the pressure of the transport network.
Commercial grain farms in North Dakota provide only $2.7 for farmers from the bus chain - about $ less than the control prices - as a reason, above all, for the cost of ensuring the capacity of incoming rails, traders and agricultural organisations say.
IN Raw Materials
The problems are the most acute of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.
The Federal Railway Supervisor shall organise a consultation on service problems on Thursday.
The northern plains need to rely on railways to transport agricultural products, as they are far from river networks.
The delay in rail transport increased when the high harvest in 2013 followed a very cold winter that caused slowing and shortening of trains.
Some farmers believe that the increased transportation of crude oil from North Dakota’s Bakken oil shale formation has oversold grain transportation, which is not true according to the railway companies.
According to a leader of an international grain trading company, the costs of grain storage and transferable sellers to ensure the use of the train have risen from zero to up to $2,000 per year from a wagon.
Someone has to pay the expenses.
\"These costs will be paid by either the farmer or the customer,\" said the CEO of the grain trading company.
The U.S. Agriculture Agency estimates that North Dakota's soy beans will grow by more than a third and 16% in the spring crop.
President of the National Grain and Feed Association, Randy Gordon, said: “We normally try to start a new crop from a clean table, i.e. a hundred have been emptyed with sufficient storage space and grain sold and transferred.
However, we are now starting late due to the service problems of trains last year.
BNSF has assured its customers and supervisors that it will handle the transport of this year’s harvest smoothly.
John Miller, Vice President responsible for the transport of agricultural products from the DNSF, said that the company has reduced long-term transport (ordered by customers to carry trains that have taken more than four days) to the bottom of April, 16 500, about two thousand.
“We’ve moved almost all the old rain we were going to move, Miller says, referring to the remaining grain from the previous harvest.
However, the latest reported speeds of the BNSF grain trains were nine per cent lower than in the second quarter of last year, which is a sign of congestion.
Miller admits that development is “unsaturated” but noted that the company is currently investing $5 billion in capital this year to improve the handling capacity of all kinds of products, such as grain canopy.
The speeds of the Canadian Pacific train that have suffered problems due to the second sum are 11% lower than that of the same year, but clearly higher than the low speeds of the first year.
The Canadian Pacific Railway Company has said to the Railway Controller (Surface Transportation Board) that changes in the ordering system of its train wagons should improve its ability to handle traffic in the next 15 to 20% of the harvest period.
“The Action Plan for the autumn of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company focuses on the continuous improvement of the speed of trains and the efficient use of trains so that we can deliver more trains every week,” said a representative of the railway company.
The Ukrainian crisis may solve the NATO identity crisis.
The leaders, diplomats and experts of major countries have often been concerned about NATO’s future and whether the end of NATO’s mission in Afghanistan also means the end of NATO itself.
However, this concern is very premature, as is apparent at the NATO Summit held in Cardiff in Wales this week, involving 60 leaders, including President Barack Obama.
The mission list of politicians and diplomats has no shortage of crises in the world, even to the extent that the exit of the Afghan troops, which had previously been a priority player, is no longer the most important thing.
Instead, the 28 government alliances are needed to re-enter Russia to Ukraine, and this is a shocking reminder that the threat of European independence is not necessarily just part of the past.
World leaders are looking for new ways to punish Russia, but they will also transfer troops, promise more money to defence spending and commit to re-engaged defence cooperation.
In some sense, NATO is to thank Vladimir Putin.
“It (NATO) was looking for a way to achieve its purpose – and it had a rather significant identity crisis,” says Heather Conley, director of the European Programme for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
NATO has not only found a new purpose, but has also strengthened it.
Obama has also added a new task to the agenda.
The President of the United States has promised to try to make world leaders create a common strategy to quickly defeat the militants of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
According to official opinions, the President will face significant challenges in trying to inspire his war-stricken partners to a military response, especially to cross the border from Iraq to Syria.
However, President Obama is under pressure to show that he is leading the world to find a strategy to win the extremists, after finding out directly that \"we have no strategy\".
Western experts have put cautious expectations to the summit on whether breakthroughs will be achieved from Ukraine or the Islamic State.
Additional economic sanctions are planned as the main means of sanctioning the event called the Russian attack in Ukraine.
Officials of the European Union dealt with this issue during the weekend, but postponed the decision on new sanctions.
U.S. officials have pointed out that the countries that Obama hopes to be the main partners in the Islamic problem are not necessarily NATO members.
The accumulation of problems could not be predicted two years ago, when the previous NATO Summit was held in Chicago, when the debate ruled by the military's withdrawal from Afghanistan.
One year earlier, Robert M. Gates, the leader of the time, took his last speech in order to say that the organization has reached a point of \"common military indemnity\".
U.S. officials constantly complained that other countries did not achieve their financial objectives.
NATO members promise to spend 2% of their GDP on defence expenditure, but only four Member States – Estonia, Greece, the UK and the United States – achieved this goal last year.
Now, however, the White House officials say they have noticed the change.
NATO members are expected to sign an agreement in Cardiff in which they promise to increase their funding for defence cooperation.
The details were discussed late last week, but the White House found that this time the company has a genuine desire to see the potential threats in their real size.
After Russia entered Ukraine, the defense promises are more important and important than ever after the end of the Cold War, says Charles Kupchan, the head of the National Security Council of the United States.
We are quite hopeful that we will achieve consensus between 28 Member States.
Obama uses a large part of its journey to strengthen its commitment to the defence cooperation in favour of Russia’s concerned neighbouring countries.
The President will begin his three-day journey with a day-long visit to Tallinn, Estonia, where he will meet both Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian leaders.
NATO has recycled its troops in Estonia since Russia joined the Ukrainian Crimean Peninsula this year, and NATO troops will be regularly recycled in Estonia when a new contingency plan to be published this week is introduced.
The plan aims to shorten the time that NATO needs to react to attacks in the border states, officials say.
The plan includes the addition of air control and other visible defence cooperation marks.
The changes hold a small risk for NATO, which abstained from setting up permanent bases for Eastern and Central Europe as a demonstration of its friendliness towards Russia.
According to officials, the new plan does not actually break the agreement, but it can also be a purely semantic difference, says a Western diplomat who did not want to name it in the course of the discussions before the official announcement.
NATO's presence is likely to be described as long-term, not permanent, the diplomat said.
Putin's powerful-talviase - Does he use it in Ukraine?
Russian President Vladimir Putin has one step in his sleeve towards Ukraine.
The Western countries and Ukraine have repeatedly accused Putin of arming the rebels in Eastern Ukraine and sending Russian troops to the soil of Ukraine.
For this reason, the West has imposed sanctions on Russia.
As the situation in Ukraine is tightened, the Western countries are planning more severe sanctions against Russia.
Russia, however, holds a card: winter is coming, and Ukraine’s main source of energy is Russia.
According to the U.S. authorities, the primary energy sources of Ukraine are natural gas (40%) and carbon (28%), according to the Business Insider by Geysar Gurbanov, who is active at Harvard University.
When the winter comes to Ukraine in the next four months and the coal mines are located in the northern part of the country’s conflict, the Ukrainians freeze into their homes when the gas supply from Russia is suppressed.
Therefore, if the rebels fail to achieve their goals, Gazprom, the Russian energy waste, will help Putin to defeat the war in the end, Gurbanov will write.
Last year, half of the gas used in Ukraine came from Russia.
Russia cut off gas deliveries to Ukraine due to unpaid invoices on 16 July.
Earlier this month, Gazprom announced that Ukraine’s debt for gas was already $5.3 billion by 1 August (around €4 billion).
According to The New York Times, Putin commented on the next winter as follows:
I think nobody thinks about it (wine) anymore, except Russia, Putin said.
There are always ways to make it easier.
First of all, the immediate cessation of hostility and the correction of the necessary infrastructure.
In order to re-install stocks, you need to make the necessary repairs and prepare yourself for the cold season.
According to Business Insider, Putin’s comment can be interpreted as a masked threat.
If the Ukrainian army does not retreat in front of the separatists, Moscow can use natural gas as a weapon.
Alistair Newman’s Japanese holding company Nomura said last month that Russia’s talks on humanitarian issues and the planning of a possible new natural gas crisis in Ukraine will be strengthened in a few months if Russia can maintain separatist activities until then.
Moscow has already announced that Ukraine will have to pay for future gas deliveries unless the Kiev sector pays the collected debt.
The EU is trying to negotiate an agreement allowing gas imports to continue temporarily.
Last week, Prime Minister of Ukraine Arseny said Russia plans to stop gas deliveries in the EU in winter.
Later, the Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak said that the speeches were impoverished.
He said Russia is doing everything possible to ensure that gas is delivered to EU countries.
The Liberal Alambuggari received 10 years of imprisonment and a thousand reefs.
The Saudi court has held a ten-year prison sentence in May for Raif Badaw, founded by the Liberal Free Saudi Liberals movement.
The judgment includes a thousand fines and a million fines (about 200,000 euros).
The judgment was based on the fact that he had set up a website that despises Islam.
On Monday, a second founder of the organization Suad al-Shamar told AFP about the judgment.
Badaw itself has been imprisoned since 2012.
Badawi was sentenced to seven years in prison and 600 rapes in July 2013, but the sentence was appealed and re-examined.
The judgment was also appealed in May, when Amnesty International also pointed out its injustice.
Madventures Riku Rantalan’s childhood experience in Afghanistan: “It was one of the most revolutionary human encounters in Afghanistan.
Madventures published today a new book World Explaination - The Adventurer’s explanation of everything.
We asked Riku Rantal about the future of the world and the differences between Indian and Finnish culture.
The crime also tells us about the most important human attack in his life.
The author, journalist, second party of Madventures, Riku Rantala is a busy man.
Today a new book has been published, yesterday there was a moviepaknik at the Citizens' Square, and on Wednesday the second production season of Ylella Docventures begins.
He's been running from one place to another since the morning.
From the morning-tv of the Maikkar to the day-to-day home and from there to a week-rounder.
An interview with a facet must be transferred to a phone interview.
Otherwise, you won't have time.
In the midst of all the rush, he and Madventures on the other side, Tunna Milanoff has had time to stop and write the World explanatory book, which according to the book’s cover, is an adventurer’s manual for everything.
All right?
Oh, that's a lot of promise.
The book looks at a number of themes, such as what is our future, why one culture is worse than the other, why we are here and who we are.
We used the interviews we've been doing over the years.
The book includes both professors and artists.
We actively worked on the book for about a year, Riku says by phone to IS.
You've picked up a big piece of the book.
What is the main message of the work?
The fact that the world needs to know more and big questions is worth considering, because then we will be able to do the best in this world.
On the other hand, the ideis is to be good at traveling, but it is also intended at home to make people talk and share ideas.
The debate can even lead to action, says Riku.
KUVA: Pete Aarre-Ahtio
One of the themes of your book is the future of the world.
What does it look like?
We concluded that the human species is optimistic.
Despite the warming of the climate and the current state of the planet, it is imperative to believe that at some point we are making solutions to improve our situation.
The Earth is a kind of alcoholic.
First, it should admit that we have a problem, only then can change, Riku philosophize.
According to some studies, Western humanity has reached the top point of happiness in the 1970s.
Since then, prosperity has not increased our happiness.
It can be concluded that once we have enough money and our basic needs have been met, we are happy.
Money does not increase happiness.
We want to wake people up and talk about what is enough.
Using our natural resources will not be enough to spend much longer, Riku says.
You also consider cultural differences in your book.
How does an Indian person differ from Finland?
People don’t really differ.
Of course, the starting points for education, health and hygiene are different.
The biggest cultural difference is that the importance of the community is much greater in India in both good and bad.
When Western countries are prosperous, people live more alone.
Let’s isolate ourselves and it may lead to loneliness and anxiety.
If we could find a suitable balance between socialism and loneliness, we would be very close to happiness, says Riku.
There are many different people in the world.
What is the best way to get into his mind?
It is my childhood, when I was with my family on my first major trip abroad.
We lived in India and Pakistan for a year while my father was there in the United Nations.
I was 7 years old and two of my little sisters were involved.
My brother was just a baby, a rich man.
In Finland, a big car was introduced to Finland.
We were driving a war in Afghanistan when there were a huge number of refugees on the roads.
On the road, a girl of my age was walking with her little brother in her arms.
I was sitting on a big mermaid's bench in my hand.
Our eyes were met, Riku describes.
A child of your age will realize the situation.
It was one revolutionary human encounter that I will always remember.
KUVA: Leena Koskela
Riku and Tunna at the book fair in 2013.
At that time, the Ruku - go to the cabbage - that other people must be respected, even if they are much poorer or they do not have the same conditions of life as we do.
At the time, the crime realized that money could not be a measure of human dignity.
From the memories of adults to the surface, people in New Guinea encounter.
I couldn’t stop wondering how traditional people live there.
They use natural materials to benefit from everything, not just using money or metal tools.
They live in very challenging living conditions.
Solving is really hard.
It made me think.
And to think about it, she wants to have her new book readers.
The idea is that our book inspires people to read, watch and listen to more.
To make it work for people from warm love to conversation, or even to a fist fight, Riku throws.
It's about Kauhakoki's magazine.
The events started when the couple arrived on the bus and ordered a taxi.
When the taxi went off, the man in the yard threw a taxi after some object.
The driver got out of the car, the same man as the passenger.
The man who had been thrown at the scene personally stabbed the man to the head and took his hand and left the place.
The stabmer is a 170 to 175 cents Danish man with short hair.
According to the newspaper, there has been a young, light-headed woman near the venue.
He is hoped to contact the police.
The police also ask for clues from anyone who may have made observations about the events or the persons involved in the case.
The stabbing occurred on Wednesday, 27 August at 19.50 p.m.
\"Moi\" told the brain - the world's first \"telepathic\" message passed through the Internet.
Science release PLoS ONE has published an article that states that the international research team has been the first to communicate the message directly to the mind.
The first messages sent through the system were “hola and ciao – in Spanish and Italian”
In the case of an experiment, the electric brain corridor of the test person was monitored.
The sender was trained with the help of the program to send bits either by thinking about the movement of the hand or foot.
The imagination of the foot movement was interpreted as zero, and the movement of the hands was the first.
This bit-coded information was sent through the Internet to the recipient.
The recipient was caused by magnetic stimulation to observe the light output per bit encoded into each one.
The recipient was taught to interpret the flashes as a message.
Researchers admit that this is still a field of study in their children’s shoes, but believe computer-accredited telepathic communication is routine in the near future of humanity.
Packages - Point - Future of the countryside
The EU is preparing new sanctions against Russia.
The United States is also tightening its own sanctions.
There is a political need for sanctions.
It would be impossible for the EU and the United States not to react when Russia is fighting in Ukraine and occupying Crimea.
In international politics, the reaction follows the act, act as countermeasures.
The experience shows that all sanctions are only over the long term.
Iran was allowed to enter into negotiations on its nuclear programme only after years.
The South African Rotoral Government sat for decades, although trade was prohibited by UN decisions.
There have also been sanctions against Russia.
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was not allowed to export top-notch electronics or military technology.
Russia itself has put barriers to trade on the world page.
Finally, raw wood was frozen.
It is clear that forced Russia not to get to its knees.
The Russians are used to bad times, and the disappearance of Violeta from the store does not cause panic.
When the EU intends to ban imports of vodka from Russia, it is mainly a joke.
The Russians would rather drink that vodka themselves.
EU sanctions are also selective.
The French will be allowed to export aircraft to Russia, but Finland will not be able to export milk.
Gas flow from Russia to Germany continues.
The biggest disadvantage for Russia is not the abolition of imports of cheese or vodka.
The main problem is the limitations of the financial sector.
It will only affect the future.
The Russian state cannot operate on the international loan market.
It must shorten old loans, but it is difficult to take a new one.
Although Russia has huge reserves of currency, they do not last forever.
The credit intake of Russian companies is shrinking and the money is rising.
Their own banks are not able to finance everyone.
You have to press more or businesses will be in trouble for payment.
Competitions are competitions in Russia, Russia is a capitalist country.
If the crisis continues for years, the Russian modernization will stop, as the Russian expert René Nyberg wrote in the Helsinki Sanomas.
It wouldn't be the first time.
At least Russia would return to Russia once again and go in.
An exceptional freepain event was held in North Korea
About 10,000 North Koreans, as well as a number of diplomats followed international free wrestling matches held in Pjongjang on Saturday in the capital city.
Antonio Inoki of Japan, who became a free-pacier, took part in the events of Japan, the United States, China, France, Brazil and Mexico.
In addition to free matches, taekwondo matches were also seen by local athletes.
According to Inok, the goal of the event was to bring the conflicting states closer together and promote world peace through sport.
In their speeches, politicians hoped to improve between North Korea and Japan.
In the summer, Japan abolished sanctions that it had imposed on North Korea as a result of Japanese kidnappings in the 1970s and 1980s.
North Korea promised to re-open the investigation of these cases.
Last time in North Korea, international free spins were seen in 1995.
SOK reduces around 110 people from the trade in goods.
YT negotiations began in June, when a reduction was estimated to be up to 130.
According to the company, its organization has now been broken down into overlapping functions and areas of responsibility have been clarified.
SOK says it is seeking a clearly better cost-effectiveness and synergies between different industries.
In addition to the economic downturn and the decline in consumer demand, there is a structural change in trade that has been shaken especially by commodity trade.
The result of the S Group’s commodity trade has been a loss for some time.
The YT negotiations concerned all employees and management of SOK’s use and up-to-date stock trading, i.e. around 530 persons.
Turun Sanomat: Some self-care medications behind the bar
According to the newspaper, there are more medicines that can be taken between prescription drugs and the medicines that are taken from the shelves themselves, but only after the advice of the pharmacy employee.
According to the Finnish Federation of Pharmacy, eye drops containing antibiotics could be subject to advice.
After interviewing a farmer or pharmacist and meeting pre-defined criteria, the drug should be given a bill, and the chairman of the Association of Pharmacy will consider Kirsi Kvarnström in Turku Sanoma.
Finland already has a few prescriptions without a prescription, but it is a medicine that requires advice.
One of these is a post-contraception product.
Corruption to more accurate causes
Finland pays even more attention to the fight against corruption.
It has been recommended by both the OECD and the Council of Europe, as the world is confused with the lack of cargo cases and judgments in Finland.
By the end of the year, the Ministry of Justice’s working group will consider whether the criminal law requires a stop to trade influence and abuse.
The differences in legislation emerged, for example, in the case of the Patria lacuum case in the case of Slovenia-Haar in Hämeenlinna a year ago.
The sale of influence in Slovenia brought a two-year prison sentence to the former prime minister, but the Finnish law does not know the same criminal term.
The anti-corruption cooperation network has been intensifying its cooperation as required by the Government Programme.
According to the survey, there is little to investigate corruption in Finland.
The Ministry of Justice has now ordered a report from the University of Vaasa and the Police University on corruption in various areas.
Messi pote nude injury - Sport - Karjalainen
The Argentine football team Captain Lionel Messi will stay out of the mid-week country match against Germany.
The fair keeps the eye on the side of the neck injury, told his company in Barcelona on Monday.
Barcelona is a precautionary measure on the Mess side.
The fair was injured in the fall of the Sunday league against Villareal.
Barcelona won 1-0.
The fair also missed a charity match in Rome.
Wanders Coach Tony Popovic believes he's going to win the Asian Champions League battle in Korea
Tony Popovic lacks three key players in Korea.
Many Western Sydney Wanderers team players are banned in the first game, and coach Tony Popovic does not hesitate to throw other players at the Asian Champions League Witch Guard at FC Seoul.
The Wanderers are in Dubai on a 10-day training camp, including two friends in Abu Dhab, so that the team can prepare for the first semi-final on September 17.
Due to excessive yellow cards, Tomi Juric, Brendan Santalab and Shannon Cole leave Korea's journey, but coach Popovic believes in their tuurars.
“Of course this is a loss – they have been three very important players in the ACL for us,” Popovic says.
Tomi Juric was banned in China from this life.
It's a back blow, no players should be gone, but we didn't have Mattya (Spiranovic) in the first game, and so far Daniel Mullen has been injured.
Whoever comes in, he must have done a lot of work, and I fully trust the whole team.
I'm not afraid to play anyone but against the semifinals.
The Wanderers will also have to be without Spiranovicia, which will still recover from the ankle surgery.
The defender of the Soccerosis team was injured before the start of the season, but has continued to run, and it is possible that he will play a return match at the Pirkek Stadium on October 1.
\"He's back in the career and he's gonna be fine,\" Popovic says.
He follows his own internship program and goes with us to Dubai, which is a great news for him because it gradually means a return to the field.
He's already practiced a couple of times outside, which is good.
It'll take a while before he's all right, but he'll be fine.
In Dubai, the Wanderers team has the world's top-ranking facilities at the Al Sheba Sports Complex.
Popovic believes that the trip to Dubai is also a good opportunity for the team to get to know each other better after the major changes of the end of the last season.
“We know this will help players to create ties,” Popovic says.
We have a lot of new players, and this is a great opportunity for them to get to know each other even better in both the field and outside it.
We use the camp for many purposes.
Elitin hamburger pays three times the employee's monthly salary
01.09.2014 21:18 In North Korea, you can enjoy the luxury of rich economies if you happen to belong to the country's elite.
The Financial Times is the opposite of the economy.
In North Korea, the informal market may flourish more than ever.
They offer a luxury to wealthy or saving ordinary citizens, which is not used to connecting to a dictatorship state.
The Financial Times has visited Munsu Water Park: the entertainment center, where only the ticket costs up to 10 months of regular employee pays.
The place is for hamburgers who pay $76.
It's 3-5 months' salary for the country's ordinary duunar.
At the pool, men drink beer in shorts.
Life looks expensive and comfortable.
The North Korean Western market began in the 1990s, when the country suffered from famine.
The government allows them to exist, even though the prices of equipment can be gross at their worst.
Yet in the capital city of Pjongang many have a mobile phone with a ovh of $200.
The reason may be in the ruler Kim Jong-un, 31, who has tried to create an energetic and youthful picture of himself.
In his time, the administration has stressed the importance of technology in the flowering of the country.

Ormiston House: Stormont Council wishes for sale
The Stormont Council is hopeful that it has found a buyer to Ormisto House, a building in Belfast that cost taxpayers nearly $3,000 a week.
The Council bought a building from the 19th century in the east of the city 13 years ago and cost £9 million.
The Council failed to sell the building further, when the security and maintenance of the building came to the Council to pay about £400 a day.
The building was sold at around 1.25 million pounds.
The building is likely to be used as a private residential building.
In 2001, the Council bought a 9 million pounds building classified in category B of historical value, as it needed more office space.
Later, however, it was found that the building was not suitable for this use.
Ten years after the purchase of the building, it was resold at a price of 2.5 million pounds this time.
The building was not sold and the price was calculated.
Last year, Mike Nesbitt of the Ulster Union Party suggested that Ormiston House might fit into a new international trauma center.
However, the Council has now confirmed that it will negotiate the sale of the building.
According to the representative, the building will be transferred to the new owner once the paperwork is completed.
Both the Council and the agent remain silent about the buyer’s identity and sales price.
The weekly safety and repair costs of Ormisto House are around $3,000.
The Council bought a building from the police force that preceded the Northern Ireland Police Board.
The security costs of Ormisto House by the beginning of this year totalled £885 641 and maintenance costs of £371,379.
The cost of repair and maintenance professional services was £250,015 and the remuneration of development and design professionals was £212,466.
The building was previously owned by shipbuilder Sir Edward Harland, who lived in the building until 1887, when it was bought by Harland's business partner William Pirrie, who later became the chairman of Harland & Wolff.
Soon after Lord Pirrie's death in 1924, Harland & Wolff became the owner of the building. The company sold it to Campbell College in 1928, which held it until the mid-70s.
“Education increases: Helsinki plans to reduce school assistants
There is no savings, says JHL.
In Helsinki, the number of school-specific training assistants is prepared for a radical reduction.
The reduction would not concern the child’s personal assistant.
In the spring, the Helsinki Board of Education decided to present a total of about 2.7 million of the resources of the school assistants.
There are a total of about 600 school staff in Helsinki.
If the contractions occur, they will enter into force in the middle of the semester immediately from the beginning of the year.
According to JHL, the decision increases inequality.
More and more children need support for learning.
However, there is a very easy reduction of aiders because the amount of aid given for learning has not been clearly defined in law.
Savings are certainly not born, on the contrary, the workload of the teaching staff increases.
In schools, savings bring a greater risk of falling from learning goals, and the sharing of teachers is also hard, stresses JHL’s industry leader, Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The plans of the City of Helsinki differ from those of schools because, in future resources, small schools and students who need support will no longer receive the help resources at all.
The goal of the City of Helsinki is to prevent exclusion.
Effective preventive work is being done by school assistants.
However, the adjustment measures of the educational agency are mainly aimed at this group.
All parties will suffer from this in the future.
In the autumn, the Helsinki City Council will make a final solution to the resources for which I hope to look forward to the future and act in accordance with its objectives, says Niemi-Laine.
Israel's power on the West Coast
Israeli women walk in a Jewish home called Gevaot near Bethlehem in Etzion.
On Sunday, Israel invaded nearly 400 hectares of land on the West Bank near Bethlehem, which may be a sign of Israel’s future major construction in the region, while at the same time threatening the Palestinians’ request not to build more homes and threaten the general opinion of the world community.
The Israeli-Peace Now Group, which opposed the expansion of the West Coast agencies, felt that the events of Sunday could be the largest single country in the West Coast for decades and could change dramatically the situation in the region.
The Palestinians’ goal is to establish their own state for the countries that Israel conquered in 1967.
According to the Israeli authorities, a political blow to assess the situation in the countryside came after three Israeli young people were kidnapped and killed in June after their elevator in the region.
In July, the Israeli authorities arrested a Palestinian who was accused of being the main factor in the kidnappings and killings.
The timing of land conquest suggests that it was meant to be a kind of benefit to the population and to the Palestinians.
Close to the Jewish Gevaot, the land area in the territory of Southern Jerusalem Etzion is now officially declared as a country of the country – when it was in the private property of the Palestinians. This was a necessary step so that Israel could, if desired, start designing buildings in the region.
However, Mayor Ahmad Lafi of Surif, a nearby Palestinian city, said the country belongs to Palestinian families.
He told the Palestinian official news agency WAFA that the Israeli army and its staff published early Sunday regulations to take over the land containing the olive and other trees of Surif and the nearby villages of Al-Jaba and Wadi Fukin.
Any objections should be made within 45 days.
The kidnapping of young people led the Israeli army to carry out a disciplinary action on the West Coast against Hamas, a Islamic group that ruled Gaza, which Israel says was behind the kidnappings.
The following tensions at the border between Israel and Gaza poured out 50 days of war, which ended last week in Egypt’s ceasefire.
The conquest of the land has quickly drawn attention to the Western coast of the Israelis and revealed the conflicting objectives of the Israeli government that hamper the wider development of the Israeli and Palestinian peace process.
Lapland’s crisis communities are usually a number of problems
An increasing proportion of the municipality of Lapland is in trouble, is reflected in a well-being study prepared by the University of Lapland and Lapland University of Applied Sciences.
There are no rapid solutions to the problems of crisis communities.
According to the professor, the reduction of municipal tasks by EUR billion is not enough.
Common features of crisis communities include poor municipal economy, poor employment and migration losses.
According to Asko Suikkanen, Emeritus Professor of Emeritus of Sociology at the University of Lapland, new crisis communities are coming from the western border and Eastern Lapland.
In the survey, residents estimate the situation of their municipality quite realisticly.
In the study, the inhabitants of well-preserved municipalities were even pessimistic.
Mild expectations affect consumption.
People hope that the present life and well-being will be preserved, perhaps even a little better.
In this time, we are not afraid to think about longer-term investments, such as buying an apartment,\" Suikkanen says.
The team surprised the large differences between the municipalities.
For example, expenditure on income support per capita varies from a couple of tens to more than one hundred euros.
The tax revenue received by the municipality per capita varies from two thousand euros to 4400 euros.
According to Suikkainen, the municipalities of Lapland are different.
How money is used, how much will be earned by state shares and what is the degree of debt, differs much in similar situations, he says.

Britain may close borders from returning Islamic fighters
Britain may temporarily prevent the return of Islamic fighters to Iraq and Syria.
It is referred to as the BBC Government Resources.
However, according to the BBC, British citizens suspected of terrorism should be able to keep their citizenship.
According to government sources, this is one of the many proposals that are considered.
The proposal is currently being finalised, and Prime Minister David Cameron is to present it.
The government is also looking for ways to make it difficult for potential fighters to travel abroad.
One way may be to increase the powers of the authorities in such a way that they could temporarily confiscate the passports of potential fighters at the border.
On Friday, Britain raised the possibility of a terrorist threat to the second highest level.
Bob Carr is delighted by the immediate release of Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor from libyal prison.
Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor is expected to be released from libyal prison today.
The federal government welcomed the news that Libyan authorities are expected to release Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor today.
Foreign Minister Bob Carr said that \"all will go well, and an international criminal court lawyer will be released from the custody of Australian authorities tonight, after which he will be on a plane flying to Europe by midnight.
“We are delighted with the news that he is likely to be released today,” the representative comments to the AAP News Office in New York.
We thank the Libyan authorities for their cooperation.
Australia also thanked the wider international community for its assistance and support, the representative said.
Taylor will probably fly to Rome before the journey to his home to the Hague.
Taylor and three of his criminal court lawyers were arrested in the city of Zitan on June 7, when they represented Seif al-Islam, the son of Muammar Gaddafi, a former dictator of Libya.
According to the Libyan authorities, Taylor took to Seif papers that they thought threatened national security.
Senator Carr has had a lot of effort to release Taylor, and he traveled to the capital of Libya in the last month to drive this issue.
Taylor couldn't talk to his husband or his little daughter before last week.
Senator Carr said Taylor was allowed to make a short call home to his home in Hague shortly after the visit of Australian Ambassador David Ritchie.
Carr also spoke with the parents John and Janell, who lived in Brisbane, who were relieved to hear that Taylor was finally given the phone.
Taylor’s parents had appealed to Libya to release their daughter before the third birthday of this little child in July.
Three other criminal court lawyers are Lebanon, Russia and Spain.
Carr said a week ago that as a result of the debate between a lawyer released in the Hague and the Libyan authorities, the criminal court lawyer was sorry and apologized for the possible misunderstanding.
The International Criminal Court has not spoken of errors, but has promised to examine the activities of its team thoroughly as its members return home.
“After a trial by the International Criminal Court, it will ensure that everyone who has acted wrong will be judged in an appropriate manner, the Court announced last month.
The International Criminal Court calls for a trial for 39-year-old Seif al-Islams against humanity during their father's term of administration, which suddenly ended last year.
According to TripAdvisor, his trial should be local and on 1 May initiated an initiative stating that he did not accept the decision of a criminal court lawyer to hold a trial in the Hague.
Young arrivals saved Barcelona - ESS.fi
Barcelona took its second victory at the early stages of the Spanish football league, but the Villarreal did not fail at home.
The blue-red fistings ended up in the Villarreal watch Sergio Asenjo, until the 82th minute finally succeeded.
The winner was a surprising man: 19-year-old, first-time in La Liga, the attacker Sandro Ramirez had only entered the field 12 minutes earlier.
The young man who received the mission team from the Barcelona 2 team finished close when Asenjo had rejected Lionel Mess's company.
The collections to the Ferguson police ended up mysteriously after $433,000.
The administrators closed two online collection sites without explanation this weekend for more than $400,000 police officers who shot an unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, Missouri State.
On the GoFundMe web site open to the public, two separate pages that carried similar names – \"Support Officer Darren Wilson\" and \"Support Officer Wilson\" have collected $235,750 and $197,620 for the Ferguson Police who shot Michael Brown.
The similar site maintained by Brown's family attorney had collected $314 099 after Sunday.
The shooting was followed by several weeks of unrest and protesting mostly against the almost white police forces of the blacks. This forced Wilson to hide while local and federal investigations were trying to determine whether he was shooting Brown for no reason.
The online collection campaigns have created some focus on the protection of Wilson, especially since some visitors on the page had written a comment on racist comments that have been removed since.
Both pages apparently ceased to receive donations at the same time on Saturday, and no reason was given by page operators.
When attempting to visit the site, he sees a message saying, “The donations will no longer be received!
The organizer has stopped collecting donations.
On Sunday, the representative of GoFundMe gave the Los Angeles Times a statement stating that the site has not prevented donations.
“Every organizer of the GoFundMe campaign decides on its own when they want to stop receiving donations,” said Kelsea Little, a representative of the GoFundMe website.
Organizers may also, if desired, continue receiving donations later.
“Support Officer Wilson, with a return of $197,620, maintains a charity group of St. Louis’s politicians, Shield of Hope, a recipient of donations accepted by GoFundMe.
Three police officers, Joseph Eaga, Timothy Zoll, and Jeffrey Roorda, who were officially appointed representatives of the Shield of Hope State collection register, did not respond immediately to e-mails on Sunday, asking for more information on the collection campaign.
Zoll is an official messenger of the Ferguson Police Department, Eaga is a close member of the Florissant City Council and a member of the Roorda Missouri House.
The Times also did not immediately contact the anonymous founder of the “Stand Up” page, which uses the name “Stand Up” and has collected $235,750. He has not been confirmed as the recipient of the donations accepted by the website.
However, the GoFundMe website representative assured The Times in its announcement that an anonymous benefactor exists.
Few information has been provided to donors about the nameless benefactor of the collection campaign, unlike the providers of the other Wilson page or Brown Gift Site.
An anonymous Wilson-page benefactor wrote a message to visitors two weeks ago, according to which the page collaborates with the Shield of Hope group to become an officially approved recipient of donations.
Approval has not yet been granted.
The beneficiary provided additional information to visitors who wanted to receive a Gmail email address with a password, but did not respond immediately to the request for further information on Sunday.
GoFundMe’s representative said in a statement to the Times that the anonymous collection page had been deleted from the main page’s search results and added that the “this campaign no longer meets the requirements of the GoFundMe website that the Facebook account must be in place.
In GoFundMe’s information security practices, users are invited to only give to GoFundMe users who feel personally and whom they trust.
Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the content of the collection page published on GoFundMe is correct and honest.
According to Mr Little, GoFundMe has, however, been in contact with the campaign organizer and has no reason to suspect his honesty.
GoFundMe will also be able to arrest all the funds collected if it is necessary to start studies in connection with a campaign.
However, GoFundMe has not considered it appropriate to reserve the funds collected by that campaign.
The popular Facebook page – Support Officer Wilson, who has organized campaigns to support Wilson, told the following weekend that lawyers are trying to find an explanation – why GoFundMe donors have been prevented from Donating, but the page did not give more information.
There is also an anonymous administrator on the Facebook page and an independent source has not been able to confirm these comments.
