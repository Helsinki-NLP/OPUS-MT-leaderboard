The members of the Welsh National Assembly are afraid to find themselves on the Muppet Show.
Some of the members of the National Assembly were discouraged on the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The alarm came after it appeared, the National Assembly (Assembly) should be called the Welsh Parliament.
Now, representatives of different political backgrounds are concerned that they can be made subject to the new title laughter.
According to one of the Labour Party members, the group is concerned that their new name will be printed on the words \"Twp\" and \"Pwp\".
Not for the sake of our Welsh readers: in Welsh language, twp is a single agent, and pwp means kaka.
According to one of the representatives of the Plaid Party, the whole group is “unsatisfied” and therefore proposes alternatives.
One conservative member said that his group “opened” to name change, however, noted that from MWP only a jump was “Muppet”
It is worth noting here that in Welsh, the letter ‘w’ is dropped in the same way as in the yorkshire English word ‘u’, i.e. the MWP, expressed as ‘map’.
The position of the National Assembly committee responsible for the development of the draft law on name change is as follows: \"The final decision, of course, is in the hands of the Members of the National Assembly\".
The Law of 2017 on the Governance of Wales allowed the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposal to take the name of the Welsh Parliament and which received broad support.
With regard to the address of the Members, the Commission prefers the title of the Welsh Parliament Member (represented by the Welsh Parliament) and its shortening of the WMP, but the public consultation rather supported the option of MWP.
However, the agreement is rather difficult, which is a problem for the President of the National Assembly, Elin Jones, who will have to submit a proposal for a law on name change in the coming weeks.
The Reform Act will also affect the functioning of the National Assembly on other points, including the disqualification of Members and the structures of the Commission.
On the matter of their own address, the Members will be able to do so during the discussion of the draft law.
Macedonia is holding a referendum on changing the country's name
Citizens vote on Sunday to change the country's name to the \"North Macedonia\".
The purpose of the referendum is to put a point at the end of a decade's debate with neighbouring Greece, one of which is also called Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that, with the name of its northern neighbour, it essentially supports territorial demand and has objected several times to its request for EU and NATO recording.
President Gjorge Ivanov is against the referendum on the name change itself, and therefore does not participate in it.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the name change is simply a compromise that must be concluded for their EU and NATO accession.
Harangs of St. Martin have been silenced in the difficult situation of the Harangs of the Temples of Harlem.
“More importantly, as I hear from older people, every corner was a bar and a church,” Adams said.
“There’s none of them today.”
As you say, the disappearance of bars would be understandable.
“People are in different ways now,” he says.
“The bars are no longer the social day where people go every day.”
With regard to the temples, Adams is afraid that the expropriation of the church wealth will not trigger the leaders’ hopes, “and they will be holding back in the same place over time from where they started.”
And in the place of the temples, it adds, there will be residential buildings whose community does not help the fate of the remaining temples.
“The vast majority of those buying homes in these buildings will be white-skinned,” he said, “and this will continue to accelerate the final closure of temples, as it is unlikely that most of those moving into these homes would join the community.”
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became the city of black – the Metropolitan Community church in 1870, the St. Martin, a decade later.
The original white Methodist church moved out of the temple in the thirty years.
then owned by a nearby black congregation.
St. Martin Church was taken over by the black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson – the honorary on the Harlem shopping street, 125th Street is known for using black or selling black products against its unsolicited business owners.
In 1939, a fireman caused serious damage to the building, but during the renovation he was built to order a community led by Reverend Johnson.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son, and successor to St. Martin's parish, proudly called the bells of the poor.
In July, an expert in bell play said this bell play is a cultural heritage, “an irreplaceable, historically important instrument.”
The University of Michigan’s expert Tiffany Ng also noted that this was the world’s first bell game, which was played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who played 18 years ago to play the biggest bell.
Merriweather said that St. Martin did not sign up for anyone.
In the last few months, a complex situation in St. Martin has been broken by the participation of architects and entrepreneurs, partly the secular leadership of the temple, partly the Bishop’s office.
In July, the leadership body of the Barony, the Church Council, had written to the Bishop’s Office, arguing that the Office would “refuse the costs – to the council, where the Council did not participate in the selection of architects and entrepreneurs who were signed by the Office.
Some members of the religious community complain about the lack of transparency in the territory of the office.
The shark attacked a 13-year-old boy in California when he died of cancer.
According to official reports, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy during a cancer killing on the opening day of the cancer season in California on Saturday.
The attack took place at the Beacon's Beach coast in Encinitas before 7 a.m.
Chad Hammel on the KSWB-TV channel in San Diego said he was diving with his friends on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he was paying attention to a boy crying for help.
Hammel first thought that the boy was just excited because he managed to catch a cancer, but then he realized that the boy shouted, “He bit me!
He's been bitten.
\"The shoulder was torn apart at his key bone,\" said Hammel, who saw what he saw when he came to the boy.
“I started to cry out so that everyone would go out of the water: “The shark is in the water,” he added.
The boy was transported to the children's hospital in San Diego, where he is currently being treated in critical condition.
The species of shark attacking the boy is unknown.
As Captain Larry Giles said to the press, a few weeks ago, sharks were detected in the area, but it was found that it was not a species that was dangerous to humans.
Captain Giles also said that the boy suffered trauma on his upper body.
The authorities closed the coastline between Ponto Beach (Casablad) and Swami (Ecinitas) for 48 hours due to the time and safety of the investigation.
According to Giles, more than 135 shark species occur in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's would expand in the British beauty market
The Sainsbury's expert would take the competition with sellers and wholesale-style pipers with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains.
In the middle of the decline in the sales of fashion and household goods, as part of the growing volume of the British beauty care market of £2.8 billion, the chain in 11 stores across the country will carry out the testing of larger piperestanes, and in the event of success they will appear in new stores from next year.
The reinforcement of the pipe line is due to the fact that stores try to fill up the shelves previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and household articles.
Sainsbury's said it would double its offer, i.e. to 3000 products, including representatives of brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweeterman and Dr. PawPaw, which are now offered for the first time.
But the former brands, L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be placed in a larger area on brand-specific stands like Boots and similar stores waiting for customers.
The chain also reboots the Boutique makeup family, in which most of the products are now vegan – these are being sought by more and more young customers today.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume shop is also testing its appearance in two Saintsbury's stores, one of which has been opened in Croydon last week, in the south of London, while the other will be in Birmingham's Shell Oak this year.
By spreading online purchases and shifting food shopping habits to small local trades, large stores need to make greater efforts to entrenched customers.
According to CEO of Sainsbury, Mike Coupe, the supply will be more and more similar to mixed trades, as the chain is trying to pick up competition with discount stores like Aldi and Lidl by introducing more and more services and other products than food.
Since he bought the two chains for two years, Sainsbury’s has been opening a number of hundreds of stores of Argos classes, as well as some of the Habitat classes – this step has also had a positive impact on food sales, so the acquisition is even more profitable.
The store chain’s previous attempt to pull up beauty and drug classes failed.
Sainsbury's began a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the debate on the distribution of revenue from drug classes in its stores ended this.
The new strategy was born after Sainsbury's sold his pharmaceutical business to the Celesio operating the Lloyds chain for £125 million three years ago.
According to the chain of stores, Lloyds will play a role in the strategy and will offer a wider range of luxury skin care products in four stores with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
As the commercial director of Sainsbury’s, Paul Mills-Hicks said: “By transforming the appearance of our pipers, we want to create a more pleasant environment for our customers.
In addition, we have also hired skilled staff to assist the interested parties with advice.
Our brand offers all the needs, the attractive environment and the conveniently accessible location provide an attractive power that increases the shopping experience to a new level.
Peter Jones’s nuclear store, after Holly Willoughby resigned from the 11 million-dollar deal
Dragons’ star Peter Jones’s “tombolva” left after Holly Willoughby’s television director left 11 million important agreements on the marketing of lifestyle products to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly's brand to sell home clothing and accessories.
The two famous companies were compared to the Goop brand previously recorded by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning’s 37-year-old director announced on Instagram that he was leaving.
Holly Willoughby carefully pulled the gun out of the Dragons star, Peter Jones, when he left their promising, lifestyle-based business at the last moment – to concentrate on his own highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to certain sources, Jones’s \"tomshop\", when television's salvation on Tuesday, at the Marlow (Buckinghamshire) headquarters of Jones's business empire, announced that, due to its new contracts of a total of 1.5 million pounds, there was no longer enough time left for their joint brand of home wear and accessories to be dedicated to Truly.
The two famous companies were compared to the Goop brand previously recorded by Gwyneth Paltrow and were expected to double Willoughby's worth of 11 million pounds.
While the 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he would leave Truly, Jones went out of the island to one of his vacations.
According to one source: “The Truly was far the most important thing for Holly.
It was supposed to deal with this in the long term, and it would give you a living in the next few decades.
The fact that he left was a total surprise for everyone.
Everyone was surprised by what happened on Tuesday, because it was so close.
In the office of Marlow, the warehouse is full of the goods for sale.
According to experts, the departure of one of the most profitable stars of this Morning, UK, can cost the company millions of dollars from pillows and candles to clothing and home wear and possible slips.
It can also mean the end of an old friendship.
The three-child hostess and husband, Dan Baldwin, had a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby launched the Truly with Capp in 2016, and the 52-year-old Jones took over the presidency in March.
The two couples are used to summering together and Jones has a 40 percent share in Baldwin’s television production office.
Willoughby will be the M&S product brand and take over Ant McPartlin as the director of the ITV I'm Celebrity.
A source close to Jones last night said: “We don’t want to say anything about [Jones]’s business affairs.”
Hard words have been said, “We have fallen in love.”
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the press for his statement, which some may consider to be “uninterpreted” and why he said so positively about the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump let you do so much?
Trump asked in a funny voice.
I didn't let anything.
As he noted, Kim would also be pleased to meet for the second time, after the first negotiations in Singapore in June, Trump welcomed him as a huge step towards the nuclear deportation of North Korea.
However, negotiations on nuclear weapons have been suppressed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Jongho, North Korea, on Saturday, said with the UN General Assembly that, as he sees his country, the United States is not born “a proper response to the early steps of North Korea.
Instead, according to his statement, the United States will continue to maintain sanctions for the exercise of pressure.
Trump said in a campaign speech much more optimisticly.
“It’s going to be great with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to war with them.
Millions of people would have lost there.
But now it's very good between us.
As he said, his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim had made a positive view of the ending of rockets, the release of hostages and the return of American soldiers.
He also explained why he spoke so unusually about his relationship with Kimmel.
“It’s not hard to act first, but there’s no ten thousand crowd out there trying to get in long, only two hundred people standing before me,” Trump said.
There are hundreds of deaths in Indonesia for tsunamis and earthquakes in the island.
Indonesia also rejected the help of international aid organisations after the Lomboki earthquake.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok had to be installed, national disasters were not reported, which would be a prerequisite for the arrival of international assistance.
“At least in many cases, it was very clear that they did not require international assistance, and that is why it is a little difficult,” Sumbung said.
The Save the Children Foundation is already working on the compilation of a Pailus-to-Send assistance team, but it is not yet certain that foreigners will be able to participate in the on-site backups.
Sutopo, a spokesman from the National Disaster Protection Agency, said that Indonesian agencies are currently assessing the state of the demand to see whether it is necessary to involve international aid organisations.
Despite the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is extremely unprepared for the devastating power of nature.
Although tsunamis were built in Aceh Province, it is not common in other coastal areas.
However, there was a tsunami signal in effect, the apparent lack of the tsunami system in Palu also contributed to the development of a disaster requiring human life.
Even in the best time, it can be difficult to transport between the Indonesian islands.
During natural disasters, logistics is even more problematic.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombs is on its way to Palu, but at least three days before it reaches the affected zone.
President Widodo put his knockout infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign in Indonesia and did not save the cost on road and rail projects.
However, the Joko government now faces budgetary deficits before next year’s elections.
In addition, the president must face the tensions of the parties in Indonesia, as the majority of Muslims began to follow a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people had to die, and tens of thousands had to be settled because of the disruptions, during which Christian and Muslim gangs fell in the streets with boxers, bows, arrows, and other fiery weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge in Liverpool is a huge equator against Chelsea

“I saw Kante coming, and I just took him down, and then I didn’t think much, and I shot him.”
Chelsea led to 1-0 in the half-time, after the Belgian starring player Eden Hadard took the lead in the 25th minute.
The blues hit the ball with corner Mateo Kovačičič, then managed to break off the midfield and rush into Liverpool.
Kovačič started after a rapid administration and returned the ball to the midfield.
He then launched a beautiful transfer of Hazard to the sixteenth.
Hazard ran the defense, and finally sent the ball to the remote corner at Liverpool's gate near Alisson Becker with a left shot.
Liverpool will meet Naples on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo Arena in Naples.
Chelsea plays against Video on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London, UEFA Europe League.
There are 832 victims of the Indonesian tsunami.
The number of victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, reported by the local disaster agency on Sunday.
As a result of the 7.5-high earthquakes on Friday and the 6-metre high tsunamis in the trail, several people were buried under the ruins, reported by the agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The streets of more than 380 thousand souls are covered by the ruins of broken buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man in the case of a stabbed woman.
Police began a murder investigation after they found a woman's body in Birkenhead, Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman's funeral was found at 7:55 in the Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
The police are asking the residents who have seen or died to report.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is still in an early phase, but I still ask everyone who was in Birkenhead in John Street, who may have seen or heard anything to contact us.
In addition, I would ask all of you, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded anything on board with a camera, to look for us as well, because they may have important information about the investigation.
Police spokesperson confirmed that the murdered woman was a sheephead resident and found inside a property.
During the afternoon, women’s friends arrived at the scene to find out where the body came from in the morning hours.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police are notifying the victim’s relatives.
A taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, tried to get into his apartment, but the police informed him that no one could enter the building and no one could leave.
When he found out what happened, he couldn't speak.
The residents of the building have now been informed that it could take even more hours to get back into the building.
One police officer told someone that the whole building was currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman was struggling with her tears.
\"This is terrible,\" he repeated.
At 2 p.m. in the afternoon, two police microbuses were inside the corridor, and another outside it.
Several police officers were watching the block.
Anyone who has any information, write a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crimestoppers organization on the 0800 555 111 phone number without a name, and link to the 247 file of 30 September.
Parliament's Cromwell statue is the latest victim of the history-rewriting fever.
The exile of the statue may be poetic justice, because Cromwell and his fanatical puritan followers destroyed England's cultural and religious heritage with Taliban enthusiasm at the time.
However, according to the Cromwell Society, Crick's suggestion is \"a fool\", a \"a attempt to redefine history\".
The President of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, said: “It was inevitable that during the current discussions on the removal of statues, at some point in time, the Oliver Cromwell statue before the Westminster Palace became a target.
During the English Civil War, the destruction was not ordered and carried out by Cromwell.
So maybe another Cromwell could be a victim of his pre-Cromwell's life in the previous century for Thomas's actions.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's impressive Cromwell is reflecting the opinion of the XIX century, and it is a historical form that must be celebrated even today by many.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell today may have been less than at the end of the XIX century, but many of us still regard it as the defender of external pressure, which, of course, was the monarchy in his case.
Whether this picture is really accurate remains the subject of a historical debate.
However, it is certain that this conflict, in the middle of the XVII century, had an impact on the further destiny of our nation, and Cromwell is an identified person who represents one of the sides of this conflict.
And it is worth celebrating the results achieved as Lord protector, and we will remember them.
A Chinese farmer was wounded to death by a killer pig.
According to local press reports, a pig attacked and injured a farmer in a market in the southwest of China.
His last name was found only in the blood of a man identified as Yuan, with a torn rival in addition to the pork on the market of the city of Liupanshui in the Kujcsou province, he reported the case on the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig breeder is preparing to be vaccinated with a vaccine for pigs in a breeding breed on May 30, 2005, in the province of Xining, China in the province of Csingha.
The man traveled with his cousin from the nearby province of Jünnan to sell 15 pigs at the fair.
The next morning he found his cousin's body and discovered that the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said that the mouth of the huge candidacy in the pork was bloody.
According to the report, the expert study found that the owner was actually the 250 kilos pig marta to death.
“My cousin’s feet were bloody, and they were barbaric,” Guiyang Evening News said only on his last name, Wu.
According to security cameras, Yuan entered the pig on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig was shut down so that no harm would be done in others while the police looked at the trail on the spot.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are currently discussing compensation for the death of the man.
Although it does not occur often, it has been reported before when pigs attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple on their Massachusetts farm and caused life-threatening injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, a 300-pound pig in Wales pushed a farmer to the tractor until the man's wife failed to alert him.
After an oregone farmer was raised in 2012, a manitobai host told CBC News that pigs were usually not prone to attack, but they could become aggressive from the taste of blood.
“They’re very players.
Like kids, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt me.
You just have to give them respect,” he said.
Severe rainfalls on Hurricane Rosa in the Southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa continues to weaken as predicted, as the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico reach.
However, Rosa will continue to cause severe rainfalls in the south-west parts of Mexico and the United States.
Rosa was hit with 140 km/h windmills, as a 1st class hurricane, at 5 p.m. on Sunday, at 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Hurricane is expected to go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure zone is formed over the Pacific Ocean and is heading west towards the western coast of the United States. As the Rosa approaches to Alaska-Clifornia on Monday, as a tropical storm, it floods the South-Western regions of the United States with heavy tropical humidity.
The storm can bring up to 25 cm of rain to some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Then, meeting with the approaching low-pressure masses will cause heavy rainfalls in the next days in the southwest.
Here, 3 to 10 cm precipitation can cause sudden floods, debris-filled floods, and earthquakes in the desert.
The heavy tropical humidity can also produce 5 to 8 cm precipitation per hour, especially in the southern areas of Nevada and Arizona.
Some parts of the southwest are expected to have a precipitation of between 5 and 10 cm, mainly in Arizona.
There may be sudden floods, with rapidly decreasing strength due to the sporadic nature of tropical rains.
It is especially not recommended to walk during tropical rains in the desert.
Because of heavy rainfalls, canyons can become suffocated rivers, and cigars are suddenly accompanied by wind blows and dust clouds.
The approaching low air pressure masses can cause severe raining on the coast of South California.
It can be up to 1.5 cm of rain, which can cause minor floods with debris and smooth road conditions.
This will be the first rain of the wet season in the region.
Sacred tropical loafs can appear in Arizona on Sunday night and Monday morning, and then on Monday and Tuesday, raining will extend to wider areas.
Serious rain spreads on Tuesday to the square region and lasts until Wednesday.
In October, there will be intense temperatures in the United States, as the polar air masses cool, but the tropicals remain quite warm.
This can also cause dramatic temperatures at short distances.
This is an excellent example of the situation in the central state of the United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) and St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) the temperature difference is about 10 degrees.
In the next few days, even in larger areas, it is expected that even summer heat will be felt.
In the central and eastern regions of the United States, the temperature is expected to be warm in the first half of October, and from the south of the Great Skills to some parts of the Northwest will be around 25-30 degrees.
The temperature in New York will reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 5 degrees higher than the average.
The long-term weather forecast shows that the temperature in the eastern parts of the United States is likely to exceed the average temperature by the first half of October.
More than 20 million people looked at Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
On six television channels, more than 20 million viewers asked about the testimonys of Brett Kavanaugh, who applied for the Supreme Court's position and the woman accused of rape in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political situation was not solved, and the broadcasters had to cancel the regular showflow due to the last Friday twist: Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona managed to get the FBI a week to investigate the charges.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Court Affairs that he was 100% sure that at the time of a high school party, Kavanaugh caught him and tried to lose him.
In Kavanaugh’s passionate testimony, he said that 100% certain that it did not happen.
The testimony was reported by Nielsen by more than 20.4 million viewers on Friday.
Nielsen calculated CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC average viewers.
Other channels, such as PBS, C-Span and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen is difficult to measure the number of people who are watching the shows at their workplace.
For the sake of comparison, so many viewers are used to being a football player or an Oscar award provider.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, an expert in support of the appointment of Kavanaugh from all channels, was the highest audience with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing.
In the second place, ABC consists of 3.26 million viewers.
CBS 3.1, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89, while CNN was seen at 2.52 million, according to Nielsen's report.
The interest did not decrease after the hearing.
The main character of the Friday drama was Senator Flake.
After the moderate Republican Senator's office issued the statement that the Senator would take his vocals with Kavanaugh, the CNN and CBS show on Friday morning, as he receives the loud crowd of protesters as he tries to meet the court committee in the elevator.
The crowd was full of eyebrows, and CNN broadcasted the scene in live broadcasts.
“I am standing here before you,” said a woman to the Senator.
“He really believes that Kavanaugh is telling the truth before the country’s public.”
Others shouted, “You have the power to do what not so many women do.
Flake only said that his office issued a statement and then, before closing the elevator door, added that he would share his words at the hearing of the Commission.
The cable and broadcasting channels were visible later in the hours, as the committee voted on whether Kavanaugh would be nominated for the full Senate vote.
However, Flake said that he was only willing to do so if the FBI investigates the charges against the candidate the next week, as the Democrats in the minority called it.
Flake was won by his conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Coons.
Flake decided to talk to Coons and other senators later.
Flake’s decision was in accordance with his power, as it was evident that without the investigation, Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve the nomination of Kavanaugh.
President Trump was investigating the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May, British Prime Minister, accuses Brexit opponents of political play
In a Sunday interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused opponents of their plans to withdraw from the European Union to threaten the future of the UK and undermine the interests of the nation.
The UK Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview on May’s title page, the former Foreign Minister of May, Boris Johnson, is attacking the so-called Chequers on Brexit, saying that the charge is to treat the customs of the UK and the EU, “perfectly absurd”
Wayde Sims murder: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson in the murder of LSU's player
Police arrested a suspect in the murder of 20 former basketball players at Louisiana State University (LSU), Wayde Sims.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested for murder in a strong start, reportedly reported to the police chief of Baton Rouge.
The police released a video of the assembly between Sims and Simpson, and announced that during the fight, Sims' glasses fell.
The police found the glasses on the site and put Simpson's DNA on it, voiced on the WAFB channel on the CBS network.
After they interviewed Simpson, the police announced that the young man admitted that he shot Sims.
According to the Advocate, the court established the bail in $350,000.
According to a preliminary report published on Friday by East Baton Rouge County's mortuary, the cause of death is the wound affecting the head and neck.
The agency thanked the state police in Louisiana for assisting the police in investigating the arrest of suspects, the state police's criminalist lab, the university police and the residents of the area.
LSU’s athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the responsible law enforcement forces for their duty and continued work in finding the truth.
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-metre high attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also the LSU basket.
Sims reached a score of 5.6 and 2.6 per match in the last season.
On Friday morning, the LSU basketball coach, Will Wade, said that the news of Sims' death “was stricken, and “sucked” the team.
“Man is always afraid that this is going to happen,” Wade said.
Vulkan floods Mexico City with ashes
The ash from Popocatepéletl volcano reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
After the volcanic activity was strengthened in the crater and a total of 183 gas and ash discharges occurred within 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Centre asked the Mexican population to stay away from the volcano.
The centre also observed several moss and agitations.
The images displayed on community ports in some regions of Mexico City, such as Xochimillco, cover the windshields of cars with thin hamburgers.
Geophysicals noticed an increase in the activities of the volcanic activity on the southeast from the capital of Mexico to 72 km after a 7,1 earthquake in September 2017.
A volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
The police struck with Catalan separatists on the anniversary of the independence referendum.
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the protesters of independence were in conflict with the police and more than one thousand joined the rival protests on the first anniversary of the referendum on the rise of Catalonia.
The group of barbarous separatists threw eggs and paint powders at them, making the streets crowded with tourists now covered with dense dust.
In the later part of the day, additional fights broke out during which the police tried to maintain the order with rubber.
“We don’t forget, we didn’t forgive you – the slogent-scaning independence party groups and the “Live Spain” group protesters were facing each other for hours behind the slogan.
According to local press reports, fourteen people were treated with minor injuries during protests.
The tension continues to decrease in the region that has been taken over by independence, in the wake of the referendum of 1 October, which was celebrated by Catalan separatists, which was considered illegal by Madrid.
The voters voted with a huge majority in addition to the division, although the participation rate was rather low, as the majority of the Unions boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people suffered injuries last year when the police tried to stop voting in polls with aggressive confrontations.
Independence groups were on the street all night long to prevent demonstrations from supporting national police.
Although it was not possible to prevent, the demonstration eventually did not go on the normal route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician involved in separatist protests, says there is no chance of Catalonia gaining independence.
“Tavaly was one of the best times of our lives.
I saw my parents drop tears of joy for what we can vote for, but our case was now under attack,” he said.
Although last December’s regional elections have succeeded in achieving a substantial victory, it is difficult for the Catalan Independence Party parties to maintain their momentum this year, after many of their most well-known leaders have taken part in voluntary exile, or are waiting for the court to make a ruling on the organisation of referendums and their role in the subsequent exclamation of independence.
The 42-year-old driver, Joan Puig, who is on his phone for protesting police, said the conflict was fired by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting increasingly tense,” he says.
One of the Catalan leaders who has been in custody since last year, Oriol Junqueras, announced on Saturday that he would start next year in the European Parliament elections.
“I can reject most of the democratic values and oppression represented by the Spanish government when I participate as a candidate in the European elections,” he said.

Menga scored the Livingston's Rangers team by 1-0.
Dolly Menga
In the first class, Livingston was a big surprise to Rangers' team by getting Steven Gerrard to his second defeat, who has been a coach for the ibrox club since 18 matches.
Dolly Menga's goal was the real difference, since Gary Holt's team was in a dead race with the Hibernian team in the second place.
The Gerrards, therefore, remained undefeated in the current season of the Scottish League, and will face the first-place Hearts team on Sunday, with eight remaining points.
Before that, however, Rangers will be waiting for a match on Thursday against Rapid Wien in the European League.
At the same time, Livingston has increased his division competition series to six victories, which means that Kenny Miller has not yet been released with the team last month.
Livingston has missed a number of situations against the unparalleled guest team
Holt's team would have been able to take the lead long before the only goal of the match, since there were no problems with their attacking game.
Scott Robinson broke through the enemy's defense, but he pulled the attack too far, and then Alan Lithgow's attempt was wide after he slipped in to reach Craig Halkett's ball.
The home team allowed Rangers to play their own game, as they were sure they could disturb guests in fixed gaming situations.
The fateful goal was born exactly from a situation like this.
The Rangers had a kick-off, and Livingston found a breach of defense. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created a situation for Menga, who invented it in the middle of the sixteenth century.
At this stage of the game, Rangers led the ball-breaking, but domestic protection remained unbreakable, and Liam Kelly's gate was barely in danger.
This trend continued in the second half of the match, except for one situation, when Kelly had to defend Alfredo Morelos' attack.
Scott Pittman's attempt was pulled off by Rangers, Allan McGregor's leg, and Lithgow was making a mistake about a new free kick in Livingston.
There were constantly cross-border balls in the Livingston sixteen, however, the defenders were resisted every time. Two of the attackers were not received by the attack team: one of the members of the Battle against Glenn Middleton, the other due to the hand.
“Fenomenal – game from Livingston – game analysis
Tony Macaroni from Arena is Allasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland's journalist
Livingston gave phenomenal performance and took the beans.
The players were one to one and a half excellently featured, and their past were beyond expectations.
The team's members and style of play have barely changed since they returned to the top, but Holt's efforts deserve a lot of recognition, since the coach came in, the team has been very excited about it.
Several players have brought the most excellent form.
The dead team captain created a great deal with his highly organized defense, and Menga was agitated by Connor Goldson and Joe Worralt.
Rangers played without an idea.
As well as they were sometimes under the leadership of Gerrard, they were now unable to get that level.
The last shot has always missed the formula – otherwise only once they have managed to break domestic protection – so Rangers must get together quickly, as they have slipped back to the middle of the field.
Erdogan found a mixed bet in Cologne
It was a pleasant atmosphere and a good morning meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany on Saturday (September 29th) in Berlin.
This was the last day of Erdoğan's visit to Germany to improve the relationship between NATO member states.
The relationship has deteriorated between the two countries due to issues related to human rights, freedom of the press and the EU membership of Turkey.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne, a newly built, huge mosque opening ceremony.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
In reference to security reasons, the police banned the assembly of the 25 000 people before the mosque, but many supporters of the president appeared to see the Turkish Head of State.
In addition, hundreds of anti-Erdoğan protesters, including many Kurds, expressed their disagreement with Erdoğan’s policy and the fact that the German government decided to accept the Head of State.
The two opposing protests are an excellent example of the president’s policy-sharing mist, celebrated by some Turkish-born German citizens as a hero, while others see the autocrate.
Road accident in Deptford: he hit a bike car and lost his life
He lost a biker's life when he hit a car in London.
The carambol was located at the crossing of the Great Road of Deptford, located in the southeastern part of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, local time at 10:15 p.m.
The driver of the passenger car stopped, and the attackers tried to help the cyclist, who died on the spot.
The collision occurred only a few months after another bike-leaved gasfall was killed on Childers Street, just a mile from the location of the Saturday accident.
According to the statement by the London police, the police continue to work to determine the identity of the man to inform his relatives.
Due to the investigation, roadblocks and bus stops make transport difficult, and the authorities advise that the cars avoid the surrounding area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Prison Guards Injured During A Disorder
Six prison guards were injured in a strictly guarded man's prison in case of a breach, reported to the prison director.
The riots began at 09:30 p.m. on Sunday in the Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire and failed to stop them for the time being.
In order to deal with the situation, the competents took on the site a special group crosses the name \"Tornado\".
The members of the special unit suffered only minor head injuries that were able to be carried out on the site.
A statement from the spokesperson of the criminal executive organization: \"The medically qualified prison team handles the situation in the LongLartin prison.
Six members of the team had to be treated due to injury.
In our prisons we do not tolerate violence at any level. The responsible will be handed over to the police and may be subject to additional prison sentences to be downloaded.
The Long Lartin men in prison hold more than 500 prisoners, among whom the country’s most dangerous criminals can be found.
In June, the prison director had to be hospitalized after one of the prisoners had been attacked.
In October last year, the special forces were also needed to overcome a serious disturbance during which the prisoners were attacked with billiards to the prison staff.
Rosa is suddenly threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (but the situation in the affected areas of drought may improve)
Arizona is rarely hit by tropical depression, but it is expected that the state will have to expect to count this at the beginning of next week, when the remnants of the hurricane cross the Rosa name will sweep through the desert in the south-west region, dramatically increasing the risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already ordered flooding from West Arizona until the southern and eastern parts of Nevada, as well as the southeastern and southeastern areas of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to travel straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, where she is expected to arrive on Monday night and bring great rains with her.
The Phonixi meteorological service published the following message on Twitter: “Since 1950, ten tropical cyclones have been hit by a tropical storm or depression within the 200-mile zone of Phonnix.
For example, Hurricane Katrina (born 1967) approached the border of AZ for 40 miles.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre predict 50 to 100 mm of precipitation, which can reach 150 mm in extreme cases, for example in the territory of Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other parts of the Southwest deserted areas (midlands of the Skills, Great Basin, etc.) 25 to 50 mm of rainfall can be calculated, but in some places can also fall 100 mm.
The rain caused by Rosa can bring relief to areas that are not threatened with lightning water, as the area is currently under severe drought.
Even though floods pose a serious threat, some of the rainfalls can have a beneficial impact on the south-west landscapes that are fighting the afloat.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring service, more than 40% of Arizona's areas suffer from minimal extreme drought, which is considered the second most dangerous category, is reported by Weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will first land on the Lower California peninsula of Mexico.
It continues to be hurricane-rich, and in the morning of Sunday, up to 137 km/h, about 600 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, and is about 19 km/h in the north.
The storm encounters colder currents in the Pacific Ocean and will lose its power.
Mexico’s coasts are expected to be once again as a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening hours.
In some areas of Mexico, heavy rain can be expected, which significantly increases the chance of flooding.
“The rainfalls can, on average, result in a 70-50 mm precipitation from Lower California to the north-west part of Sonora, where at some point 250 mm of rainfalls can befalled,” says Weather.com.
Rosa then goes north through Mexico as a tropical storm, before Tuesday, during the early dawn hours, she would reach Arizona, in the form of a tropical depression, so that she can go through Arizona on Tuesday to the south of Utah.
“The biggest threat caused by Rosa and its remains in the Lower California, Northwest Sonora, and the expected rainfall in the Southwest desert regions of the United States will be,” the National Hurricane Centre said.
Rainfalls are expected to cause life-threatening lightning streams and canal flow in deserted areas, and landfalls in mountain areas should be kept.

According to Trump, Kavanaugh had to suffer from the “rare and anger of the Democratic Party”
“Whoever votes for Judge Kavanaugh will vote against the relentless and disgusting tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a meeting in the city of Wheeling in West Virginia.
According to Trump, during his nomination Kavanaugh, the Democratic Party had to suffer from its “badness and anger.”
Kavanaugh testified on Thursday before Congress, where he strongly and passionately denied Christine Blasay Ford's claim that he had committed sexual violence as a teenager for decades.
At the hearing, Ford also testified and stood by his previous claims.
On Saturday, the president said that “the Americans saw with their own eyes the same day as Kavanaugh’s brilliant and unspeakable character.”
“In addition to one of the most outstanding legal professionals of our time, in addition to Judge Kavanaugh, the monks who have a macular public service premier,” Trump said to Western Virginia supporters.
The president referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the interim elections.
“Only five weeks will separate us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don’t start personally, but I’m basically starting,” he said.
“That’s why I’m going everywhere to support the best candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats followed the tactics of \"restriction and obstacle\".
The first Senate vote on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, a leading Republican adviser told CNN.
Hundreds of people died in a tsunami caused by an earthquake in Indonesia, and the number of dead is rising.
Many people were killed by the price, and at least 384 people died when the huge waves reached the shore. The disaster was caused by a strong earthquake and tsunami on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, the local authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered in the city of Palu at the festival on Friday, when nearly six meters (18 feet) high waves reached the beach at the beginning, many were gathered and destroyed in their path.
The fountain was triggered by a 7.5-strong earthquake.
“When the tsunami surveillance was raised yesterday, people simply stayed on the shore, did not flee, so waves became a victim,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian disaster prevention agency (BNPB) at the Jakarta press conference.
“The fountain didn’t just come within itself, and cars, walls, houses, and all the more so on the coast,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving at a speed of 800 km/h on the open sea before it reached the coast.
There were those who climbed to the top of the trees from the price and fled, he said.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 shelters, please.
In the air footage published by the Agency from the disaster, there are a number of destroyed buildings and business premises, several twisted and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, further post-warnings shaken the coastal city.
The earthquakes could be detected in an area around 2.4 million people.
According to the statement by the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT), about 200 times more energy was released during the Friday earthquake than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The agency added that the city was located at the end of a long and narrow bay and that the resulting geographical abilities could strengthen the impact of the fountain.
According to Nugroho, the damage caused was “important,” in the disaster, thousands of houses were destroyed, and hospitals, malls and hotels collapsed.
Several victims' bodies were found among the ruins of broken buildings, he said, and then added that the number of injured has been 540, and they are looking for another 29 people.
According to Nugroho's statement, the number of injured people and damage in the area called Donggal, raining at 300 km (190 miles) from Palu, may be even higher, as it was closer to the epicentre of earthquake.
Communication is “fully paralyzed,” said Nugroho.
“There are more than 300,000 people in the Red Cross’s communication, which also announced that the experts and volunteers of the organization are already on their way to the disaster area.
“The situation is tragic, but it can be even worse,” they added.
The agency received a number of criticisms on Saturday that he did not inform the population about the Palut fountain, but according to the management, the waves reached the shore when the alarm was released.
On one of the amateur recordings shared on social media, a man tries to warn the people on the street of the nearby fountain from the upper floor of a building.
Within a few minutes, a huge wall of water will be poured into the shore, with cars and buildings running with you.
The Reuters news agency has not yet been able to justify the validity of the recording.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a lack of electricity, impossibility of communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue works.
Aid shipments from Jakarta and other cities sent by military cargo aircraft, but according to the authorities, the evacuated population will still need food and other basic needs.
The city’s airport was opened only to facilitate aid work, closed for all other purposes until October.
President Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centres set up on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
It's a very bad situation.
The World Vision team safely arrived in the city of Palu from Donggala, where employees found refuge in the courtyards of the office, but in their journey they met with the traces of terrible destruction, Doseba said.
“They said they saw a lot of ruined houses,” he added.
It's a very bad situation.
While assistance teams were able to prepare disaster prevention work, some complained that foreign experts with great experience in this area could not travel to Palura.
According to Indonesian regulations, support, aid and staff from overseas can only be released to the country if the place of disaster is declared a disaster at national level.
That didn't happen all the time.
“The case is still treated as a regional disaster,” said Aulia Arrani, a spokeswoman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government recognises that it really is a disaster at national level, we can let in international aid services, but no announcement has been made so far.”
On the second night after the shock and tsunami of Friday, friends and family members of the missing were still hoping that they would be among those whose miraculous escapes would smuggle some light into the dark mood of reports of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the channel during rescue work.
On Sunday, the workers managed to release a woman who had been in need of her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, a coach of the Indonesian National SUV team, created two competitors for Asian Games that were held in Indonesia at the beginning of the month.
In addition to the missing, other students were staying at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi.
“As a veteran parasol, things have put a great deal of mental pressure on me,” he said.
Gendon recalled that when news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel began to spread among the cyclists, he was desperate for hours at WhatsApp to reach the racers who were just at the beach festival.
However, in addition to the messages, only a single grey pipe appeared instead of two blue pips.
“I think that means that the messages could no longer be delivered,” he said.

Kanye West: the name of the rapper changed to Yere
Kanye West, the rapper's name is Ye.
The change was announced on Twitter on Saturday with the following message: “The being, previously called Kanye West, was called Kanye West.
The 41-year-old West has been called Ye becenamed for several years, and this was also the title of the eighth album published in June.
The name change was announced before Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to show the new Yandhi album.
In the show, Ariana Grande takes over her place, who “for emotional reasons,” referring to the role, said the producer of the show.
The new name is not only the shortening of the current name of the rapper – according to previous revelations, West has a religious significance.
“I know that “Ye” is the most frequently used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “it,” West mentioned earlier when he spoke with the radio director Big Boy about his album’s address.
So it's you and I, and we're all one.
Kanye means the only one, and it was only Ye, which is a sign of good living in us, evil, confusion, everything.
The album rather reflects who we really are.
Ye is one of the famous rappers who will change their names with love.
Sean Combs, for example, has run the name Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, and Diddy, but this year he has announced that he prefers the names of Love and Brother Love.
West’s former co-author, JAY-Z, has also varied several times by whether his name should be written with one, a tieter, or a big bet.
The Mexican President has accepted that he will not take the army against civilians.
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexican president of Mexico, promised that he would never take the force against civilians in connection with the upcoming 50th anniversary of the blood baths.
López Obrador on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square promised that he would never use the army to suppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, military troops opened fire on the ground to participants in a peaceful demonstration, causing the death of about 300 people, when the left-wing student movements showed signs of strength in Latin America.
López Obrador promised to help young people in Mexico – participating in monthly financial benefits and planning to set up additional free public universities.
He argued that the lack of unemployment and education are the two main factors that drive young people into the arms of criminal organizations.
The U.S. should double the funding framework for MI solutions
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of research and development of artificial intelligence, the United States should double support for research in this direction, Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and user of solutions that use artificial intelligence, who previously worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He said that the U.S. government made reports about artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have an official MI strategy.
China has also announced its related plans: the country’s goal is to become the world’s world’s top MI developer by 2030.
“The double cost framework for MI research would be a good start, as all other countries are significantly left behind compared to the US, and the next breakthrough in MI would be limited,” Lee said.
By double research aid, the chances of the US doing the next major step in the field of artificial intelligence could also increase to a double extent, he said in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ (The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order) was published this month in the care of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of the Sinovation Ventures company. The company was used to invest in one of the most significant companies in China, MI+.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on an MI system that managed to defeat the best American Othello player, and later as a member of Microsoft Research’s leadership and as president of Google’s Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged the results of the technology competitions previously announced by the US government, including DARPA Robotics Challenge, and was interested in when the next such event would be held, because at this time there was an opportunity to explore new future formats.
Researchers in the United States often need to work hard to gain the necessary state support for their research, Lee said.
“China is not about to take over scientific leaders, but about large companies.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have signed several major university skulls over the past few years to work in the field of MI.
According to Lee, changing immigration policy could help the United States’ efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think you should automatically receive a green card for those who have a doctoral degree in the field of artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese Council of State announced its next generation plan for developing artificial intelligence.
China's national natural science base provides similar support to academic institutions, as the US National Science Fund (NSF) and other government organisations share money for American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, explained Lee.
This year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Article Intelligence Center MI Center, where various industry professionals and academics can work together, and the White House announced the establishment of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA invested $2 billion in an AI Next initiative.
The NSF currently spends $100 million a year to support MI research.
At the same time, the U.S. legislation, designed to establish a National Security MI committee, has not taken any further steps in the case for months.
There is a referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name.
The people of Macedonia were in the Sunday referendum to change the country's name to the \"Negre-Macedon Republic\". With this step, they would resolve a decade of disagreement with Greece, which prevented the acceptance of the country's EU and NATO membership request.
Greece, one of its provinces, called Macedonia, argued that the name of its northern neighbour indicated that he was in need of a similar Greek territory, so far, he had been vetoting NATO and EU membership of the country.
In June, the two governments negotiated a deal with the new name of the state, but according to the national emotional opponents, the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not participate in the referendum, and as a result of the boycott campaign launched, it became doubtful whether you would have the 50% participation rate required for a valid referendum.
The question on the ballot board is as follows: \"Do you support NATO and EU membership of the country and accept the agreement with Greece?\"
Supporters of the name change, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price should be paid in order to be one of the countries raised in the ruins of Macedonia, as one of the EU and NATO memberships.
“I am here today to vote for the future of the country so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it would mean a safer life for all of us,” Olivera Georgijevska (79) said in Spain.
Although the referendum itself is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have stated that they feel that the result of the vote is mandatory.
The name change requires two-thirds of the majority in Parliament.
According to the State Election Committee, no reports of irregularities were received until 13:00 on the day of the vote.
However, until now, the participation rate reached only 16%. This value was 34% in the 2016 parliamentary elections (at the end of which 66% of registered voters participated).
“I came to vote for my children because we have our place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski (62), who cast his vote in the capital city in Spain.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, wife, Zorica, and their son Dushko, took their seat in Stromica, a referendum of 30 September 2018 that would allow the country to join the EU and NATO bond.
Before Parliament's building, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) set up a small stage, as well as chairs and tents for boycotters.
“We also support NATO and EU membership of the country, but we want to join proudly, with a raised head, and not through the celestial door,” Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have not lost our dignity.
If you do not want to accept us as Macedonia, you can also turn to China or Russia as part of the Eurasian integration.
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership could be accounted for by investments in Macedonia that the country with an unemployment rate of up to 20% needs.
“I think that the majority will support our case, as more than 80% of the country’s population fundamentally supports EU and NATO membership,” Zaev said.
He also added that the “yes” vote means “ensure of the future of the country”
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, 30 to 43% of voters are expected to participate in the referendum, which is lower than the required participation rate.
On the basis of another survey by Macedón Telma TV, a 57% attendance rate is expected.
For those who want to vote, 70% said he would do yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the participation rate should be at least 50% more than one vote.
The referendum would be the first serious blow to the West Party government, which took power last year in May.
Video: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, gets the whole brighton protection in exchange for the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took a deep appeal to Brighton's defense, so Manchester City won 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in England.
Aguero got his shot in 65 minutes as if that was the easiest thing in the world.
The Argentinian battler, as the first step of the attack, received a pass on the midfield, and
He came out in the open field with the three Brighton protectors.
Then four green bees round Aguero.
He took a guard, then ran down to Brighton's sixteen.
Then he reached the left of Sterling, who appeared there.
The English fighter has already returned the ball to Aguero with force within the sixteenth, who has finished the action with a better foot, exploring the right side of the Brighton netguard Mathew Ryan's gate.
“Aguero has problems with his feet,” said Pep Guardiola, Manchester City Manager.
We agreed that you can play 55, up to 60 minutes.
And that's how it happened.
Fortunately, that’s when he got the goal.”
With Sterling's action, he managed to get the blues in an English championship match.
The goal was born in the 29th minute when
Aguero, located on the square of the Brightons, received a great pass.
He launched a beautiful crossball to Leroy Sane on the left side.
Sane played with the ball for a while before he started Sterling.
The blues could only push the ball into the gate before sliding outside the base line.
City’s closest Tuesday, 12:55 in Sinsheim, Germany, is playing with the Hoffenheim team in the Champions League.
Scherzer wants to make Rockies difficult
Since the Nationals team missed the opportunity to enter the postseason, they had no reason to really force them.
However, Scherzer, who is always competitive, is barely waiting for him to stand on Sunday's track against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the opponent team still has a chance to play. Rockies is a matchd advantage in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West baseball league.
Rockies has secured at least one vulnerable place with the victory against the Nationals on Friday evening, but the first title of their division is still waiting for you.
“While we no longer have a chance, we can stand up against them, the mood of the audience and the other team in Denver is expected to be on the roof for the whole year.
Of course I want to be on track like this.
The Nationals team still has to choose the beginner for Sunday, but the news shows that Scherzer will be the drummer in this situation.
Scherzer, who took part in a drum session on Thursday, will be his 34th opening on Sunday, which is usually his day of rest.
The right-hand Washington player has 18-7 in this season, 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts after 220 and 2/3 in the game.
Trump in West Virginia
The president also referred to the situation of the supreme judge, who was around Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the interim elections.
“In November, everything we’ve done is at stake.
We are just five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lives.
It’s one of the greats, the big ones – I’m not going personally, but I’m basically going, so I’m going everywhere to support the best candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “Everyone sees what these terrible, radical democratic groups are doing with their own eyes.
They are truly determined, and they can use any means to regain power, to see evil and sublime.
It doesn’t matter who they hurt, who they put in their hands to have control, their power. That’s what they want, control, and power, but we don’t abandon ourselves.
The president said the Democrats put in \"restraint and obstacle\".
“They could have seen all this in the last four days,” he said, “he is angry and malicious and lying and lying,” calling the Democrats.
According to his name, he mentioned Senator Diane Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which he declared the loud negation of the gathered crowd.
“Do you remember what he said?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, what's that?
No, no, no, wait, all that with a very bad speech of body, that was the worst speech I've ever seen.
The Labour Party no longer supports diversity.
It does not tolerate those who freely say what they think.
I was not surprised at all when the Momentum activists decided on my censorship.
After all, I am only the last in a long line of Labour Party Members who were told they were not welcome, just because we said what we thought.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, has received a similar treatment for resisting anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship didn't like the fact that I didn't understand one with Jeremy Corbyn.
In addition, the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, which are ironically the issues in which Jeremy also disagreed with the former leaders.
At the invitation of the Labour Party meeting held in Nottingham East on Friday, they said they wanted a “consumptuous and productive meeting.”
For most of my eight years as a local representative of the Labour Party, these Friday evening meetings were exactly the same.
Today, however, the sound has changed, and the more polite, polite, political promise has been forgotten if it has ever been realized.
It is increasingly noticeable that the Labour Party does not tolerate different views and all opinions are judged on the basis of whether the party is acceptable to the leadership.
This trend began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the couple. My colleagues with whom I thought we had a similar political attitude, have been waiting for more and more times to turn my back on my individual opinion, and in addition to things I would never agree with, whether it be a matter of national security or the single European market.
After every public speech, no matter what I said, they're starting out on social media, they're demanding my redemption, criticizing the policy that drives me to the center, and they're telling me that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
This isn't just happening to me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than many of my colleagues because the comments that I have received tend to push me into politics.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my political colleagues, who are forced to stand out on a daily basis in sexy and racist attacks.
The most disappointing aspect of our day’s policy is that such attacks have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should support the culture of tolerance.
The reality, however, is that we have abandoned diversity and that every 'confidence' initiative and any changes to the electoral rules is becoming increasingly limited in the party.
Over the past few years, many have advised me not to be so literal, and then “all will be fine.”
However, that’s not why I entered the political field.
32 years ago, I joined the Labour Party as a student, for he was angry that the Thatcher government neglected schools so much that our classroom was almost ominated, and then I fought for better public care for the most needy local adviser and government minister.
I never hid my political views in the bathroom, nor did I do otherwise during the last election.
Nottingham in East was absolutely clear to everyone about what political positions I represent and on which I disagree with the current leadership.
For those who supported the motion on Friday, I say that in this situation, when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm not only families, but also companies and public services, I do not understand why so much time and energy should be used to question my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
My most important message, however, is not to the members of Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that any threat to redemption or political purposes will not lead me to act in my own opinion and in the interests of everyone.

Ayr-Melrose 38-17: Ayr runs into the top
Two late attempts have been slightly modified at the end, but there is no doubt that the Ayr won the most entertaining match of the day, Tennent’s Premiership.
The team is now at the forefront of the tabella, the only of the ten teams being unbeatable.
Their unparalleled protection and careful use of the situation led to victory, so that the domestics and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
“We had to face a number of challenges in our match so far, but we are still unbeatable, so I have every reason for happiness,” he said.
Robyn Christie, Melrose’s player, said: “We need to know that Ayr has made a lot more use of his situation than we do.
Grant Anderson made a 14-minute attempt to make Frazier Climo a point, and Ayr got the advantage of the game. Thanks to the yellow paper directed by the Warriors to Captain Rary Hughes Scottish, Melrose would have been able to reduce the difference, but Jason Baggot's attempt was not a point.
Climo was sweating Ayr's defense with a criminal, just in half-time, and then a one-person experiment, so the first half-time ended with 17-5 results for Ayr's benefit.
Melrose began the second half, selling Baggat’s attempt by Patrick Anderson, reducing the team’s disadvantage to five points.
The game then stood for a long time, since Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury and had to be taken off the track, and Ayr continued to increase its advantage by trying to get rid of Stafford McDowall, with the help of Climo.
Blair Macpherson, Captain Ayr, also received a yellow card, and then Melrose managed to prevent Bruce Colvine from trying to break the pressure on them.
The home team started to lock up again, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for installing Climo without a ball, MacPherson showed touch down behind Ayr's team.
Climo sold what he repeated almost immediately after his reboot when Kyle Rowe took off David Armstrong's high kick and sent Gregor Henry to try the fifth of his homeowners.
Still Game’s main character started a new career in the hospitality industry
It seems that one of the stars of Still Game, Ford Kieran, is moving towards the hospitality industry: it was revealed that a restaurant was placed at the head of a company.
The 56-year-old actor Jack Jarvist plays in a popular series of BBCs that he writes together and works with his old comedian Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the next nineth will be your graduation season, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning on the life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he was the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not comment on the news, although a source of the Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan was trying to profit from the Glasgow-flowered hospitality industry.
\"The sea is ours: Bolivia, without the coast, hopes that the court will again open the way to the Pacific Ocean.
Marines patrol around the Marine Command in La Paz.
Ocean flags are floating in the centers.
From Lake Titicaca to Amazon, the marine bases advertise the following myth: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to regain
In unseasoned Bolivia, the memories of the lost coast still live vividly in a bloody conflict with the resources of the XIX century, Chile, and the desire to repel the waves of the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes have probably been most powerful for decades, since Bolivia is waiting for the first of October of the International Court of Justice to decide on a five-year trial.
“There is a ball that floods people with the spirit of belonging and peace who wait for the final development in a positive mood,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a diplomat in Bolivia.
A lot of Bolivian follow-up to the decision of the International Court of Justice, hoping that the Hague Court will stand in favour of Bolivia, and Chile will be obliged to sit on a negotiating table after decades of rapsodic approach to get Bolivia's own access to the sea.
Evo Morales, a charismatic, indigenous president of Bolivia, who looks at the controversial struggle he must continue for the next year’s re-election, can lose a lot with the Monday judgment.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said.
However, some analysts think that the court will probably not decide for Bolivia, and that would not change much if the decision was still favourable to Bolivia.
The United Nations in the Netherlands has no right to judge over Chile and has also concluded in advance that it will not affect the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice was born only six months after the final talks indicates that the case was not complicated, Paz Zárate, an expert in international law.
In addition, the last four years did not help Bolivia's cause, but he even took it back.
\"The maritime exit issue was addressed by the current Bolivian government for its own purposes,\" Zárate said.
\"Because of Morales' enemy rhetoric, the remaining kindness of the Chileans has also gone away.\"
Bolivia and Chile will definitely continue negotiations at a point, but after that, it will be extremely difficult to initiate dialogue.
The two countries have not delegated an ambassador to each other since 1962.
The former president, Mr Rodriguez Veltz, from Bolivia in the Hague, disagreed with the conclusion that the judicial decision was unusually quick.
Monday, Bolivia offers a “exceptional opportunity to open a new chapter in its relations with Chile” and a chance to “both come out well from the close of the 1339 years of dispute,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, would have used the sea debate to make a political advantage of it.
“Bolivia will never give up her right to the Pacific,” she added.
“The judgment gives us the opportunity to see that it is time to go beyond the past.”
North Korea: There is no nuclear decommission until they can trust America
According to the North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ri Jongho's country will not be the first to take down nuclear weapons if they can't trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with the promises made by the leaders of the two rival countries at the summit in Singapore.
He made the comment when it seemed that the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was able to reinstate the dreaded nuclear negotiations more than three months after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jongung.
Ri said, \"I'm looking,\" I think that the constant sanctions and the US protest that closed the Korean war will ever be enough to force North Korea on its knees.
Washington is changing from accepting the declaration if Phenjan does not take significant steps towards decomposition.
Both Kim Jonggun and Donald Trump would like a new summit.
However, wide-ranging scepticism reflects Phenjan's commitment to installing the arsenal, which is probably considered the only key to the country's security.
Pompeo is planning a Phhenjani visit for next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris Fashion Shows are the huge headcovers that will soon appear in top-class stores.
If you want to expand your hat collection or want to completely cover the day, you won’t have to look for it anymore.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of unusually oversized headcovers as part of their spring/summer collection in 2019, which was welcomed by the fashion-style audience in Paris with great enthusiasm.
Practical hats that can be called non-reputable have produced sensations on Instagram in the summer, and these fashion designers have also set out their remarkable works.
Valentino’s most spectacular piece was an exaggerated beige hat, decorated with penile, wide-carima, and almost completely absorbed the head of the models.
Among the other oversized supplements, a goldsmith, a magic hat, and even a pineapple, which were not really designed to keep the head of man warm.
Thom Browne also came up with a selection of bizarre masks, just in time before Halloween.
Many of the colored masks were sewn in their mouths, and they were more like Hannibal Lecter than the haute couture.
One of these pieces resembled a diving mask, supplemented by a pipe and glasses, and another painted like a melting bowl of ice.
If you come in with these spectacular pieces, you're lucky.
The style analysts predict that the huge caps are already on their way to the top class clothing shops.
The oversized hats follow the path of La Bomba, a 60 cm wide armpit that we have seen from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural brand behind the little practical hat of social sites presented a new piece on the runway: a beach bag made of apple, almost as large as the bathing suit that holds it.
The dark orange-colored rafia bag, decorated by rafia boycotts, and on top of a white leather tooth, was one of the outstanding pieces of the collection of Jacquemus spring/summer La Riviera in Paris fashion week 2019.
The star stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect that next summer the huge hats and beach bags will appear in the top-class clothing stores. The designer has created a fundamental effect on everyone that it would be difficult to deny the demand for oversized accessories.
John Edward: Language knowledge is essential for world citizens
The Scottish independent schools traditionally provide excellent education. Despite the latest outstanding exam results, this situation has not changed to 2018, which is only further strengthened by individual and group successes in sports, arts, music and other community initiatives.
In Scotland, more than 30,000 students have studied in such institutions as The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and are striving to provide students and parents with the best possible services.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further learning, higher education, their chosen careers and the role they play as citizens of the world.
In an educational sector where there is an opportunity to plan and introduce customized school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and sought subjects.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak in a language that you understand, you get to your head.
If you speak in his language, it will reach his heart.
This is an important reminder because we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with those from other countries.
This year’s exam results show that students from independent schools have produced the best results from foreign languages across the country.
68% of all students studying a foreign language achieved a higher degree (more than 85%).
Based on the data collected from SCIS 74 colleges, 72% of students received a higher degree in Mandarin, while 72, 69 and 63% of German students reached the degree A.
These results also support the fact that independent schools in Scotland view foreign languages as an essential knowledge that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Today, languages, as chosen objects, have become at least as important as natural sciences, technology, technical sciences and mathematics, both independent and other kinds of schools.
The survey of the UK Commission for Employment and Training in 2014 showed that, according to 17% of employers, the filling of empty positions is difficult due to the lack of language knowledge.
We can also see that language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to enable young people to pursue a successful career.
Since more and more jobs are waiting for knowledge of foreign languages, language skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of what kind of career you choose, if you learn a foreign language, you will gain a lifelong knowledge of which you will have a clear advantage.
The ability to communicate directly with other nationalists will automatically provide a competitive advantage for applicants who speak multiple languages.
According to YouGov’s survey, in which 4,000 adults were asked in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of respondents could not speak enough in any foreign language, and the French was the only language spoken by more than 10% of respondents (15%).
This is why it is important to put emphasis on teaching children.
Talking in several languages, especially in the language of developing countries, can be a tool in the hands of children, which allows them to apply for more important jobs as adults.
In all schools in Scotland, they will deal with different languages.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while several will teach languages such as Mandarin or Japanese, which are expected to be of great importance for the UK by 2020.
Whatever the child’s interests, you can learn several optional languages at independent schools, and they will be taught by those who are experts in their area.
The Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment for children that prepares and equips them with the skills they will need to succeed, to maintain whatever the future is.
It is not difficult to note that languages in today’s global business environment are still vital for the future of a country, and this education must also reflect.
As a matter of fact, knowledge of modern languages should be treated as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools offer the opportunity to choose, diverse and quality education for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien down faire – this is how it should be.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron San Diego
They don’t have to wait long for fans to sit on needles to see LeBron James first in Los Angeles Lakes.
The Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would be playing for the pre-season Sunday opening match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes will he spend on the field is questionable.
\"More than one, and less than 48,\" Walton wrote on the Lakers official website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a limited period of time.
After a few days ago, James was asked what his plans were with Lakers in the six-season pre-season season.
“On this point of my career, I don’t have to play in the preseason season to be ready,” he said.
Trump's West Virginia campaign and YouTube channel
Donald Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts a long series of campaign events tonight.
This will be the first of Trump's next week's five incarnate events, including as stops as he supports Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that it has been postponed by a vote confirming the candidate of the deputised seat of the Supreme Court, Trump is trying to gather supporters for the next half-time elections, as there is a risk that Republicans will lose power over Congress when the votes run in November.
When does Trump start tonight’s Western Virginia event and where to follow online?
The speech of Trump Wheeling (Nyugat-Virginia) begins at 7 p.m. on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
Trump's Western Virginia meeting can also be followed online through live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to be affected by his top court candidate Brett Kavanaugh's hearing this week, which proved particularly tense in the light of sexual harassment charges, and the Senate's confirmation vote was suspended for up to one week until the FBI's investigation.
However, the primary objective of the sudden booming events is to help the Republicans’ situation before the November elections.
Trump’s campaign adviser says that the next week’s five events serve to activate “voters and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they currently own in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” Reuters wrote.
“The fact that Congress’s leadership is in its hands is so critical of its political plans that the President visits as many states as possible. We look at it as a tight campaign period,” Reuters reported a campaign spokesman asking for his name to be heard.
Today’s event, which is planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can also bring supporters from the States of Ohio and Pennsylvania, and even be included in the media reports of Pittsburgh,” says West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will be the second time in the last month to visit West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is not in a favourable position.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should personally engage in better research,” said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The American team fights with full shoulder width in front of Sunday individuals to keep hope alive
After three unilateral attempts, Ryder Cup needed four matches on Saturday afternoon.
The flying shirt of the luck and moment is a sport concept that is quite aired, yet all players believe in it, mostly in competitions such as Ryder Cup.
So who has the ball now?
“They had a six-point drive, and they had only four advantages, so we can say that we have the ball,” Jordan Spieth said, “as he walked away at the end of the day.
With four points, of course, Europe is still leading, and there are twelve more available.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they finally got a little back, and they can encourage more of everything, including Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and both of them got three points out of the four.
Spieth proved infallible from the start to the hole, and his performance was exemplary.
The cry for a good victory was getting louder, as he went ahead with the circle, finding and balancing with a critical twist in the fourth match, so that he and Thomas were in double disadvantages after two.
The game-Dealing guerrilla has resulted in a similar cry for joy in the 15th hole, a kind that can believe the viewer that the American team is not lost yet.
“You just have to dig deep in yourself and only care about your own game,” Spieth said.
That's exactly what's still waiting for players.
18 holes for the chance to leave a trail for themselves.
In the last two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the most popular couple in Ryder Cup, could score more points than Spieth and Thomas.
Europe’s strange couple, but adorable couple of four, brought four of them, and it seems they can’t make mistakes.
“Moliwood was the only pair who didn’t perform on Saturday afternoon, and on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning at the last nine stages of the same performance.
Thanks to this series and the dynamics between them and them, they became the standard by Sunday, and no one expects the Sun to secure Europe’s victory with the rest of the Le Golf National track, such as Fleetwood or Molinari.
The best thing would be to win at the same time as different holes.
However, it would be too early to celebrate the victory of Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were quickly executed by Sergio García, the fourth hero of the morning when Alex Noren played together.
Once with one and twice two blows over the par, the first nine holes were spanish and Swedish, which hit them in a wave valley where they had no chance of climbing out.
On Sunday there will be no one to help you out of your hole.
The four-ball games and the four-ball matches are extremely entertaining from close to the partners' interactions. You can pay attention to who gives advice on what is not given and how the strategy can change during a glance.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and has a significant advantage for the last day, but this section of four has shown that the US team has the course of struggles, in spite of the fact that many of them were missing from the US side, especially from the U.S. side.
Europe starts the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10-6 advantages.
Europe can start the last day of the Ryder Cup with a good advantage after closing the four-ball and four-ball matches on Saturday with a result of 10-6 against the United States.
The dynamic Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the bow, taking two victories against the vulnerable Tiger Woods, raising the difference to four points on Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjørn, who strives to regain the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated by the constantly flawing American team during the morning four-ball match, winning the series by 3-1.
America has shown greater resistance in the fours, bringing two matches, but they have not been able to suppress the difference.
Jim Furyk's team should get eight points from the 12 individual matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novel who won four points in the series, while he and Molinari, who are only mentioned as \"Molliwood\" after a sensational weekend, the second pair of Ryder Cup history, which gained four opening matches.
After they beat the Woods-Patrick Reed pair in the four ball, they defeated the unmotivated Woods and the U.S. Newman Bryson Dechambeau for a determined 5&4.
Woods, who attracted himself in two matches all the way on Saturday, sometimes even muted his talent, but lost 19 of the four-ballers and four-persons, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested in the morning with four ballers, returned to her partner, Henrik Stenson, and in the fours they defeated the first and third place in the world list by 2&1, the Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka.
However, Europe did not succeed in all this pleasant, windy day, southwest of Paris.
The three-time titler Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed Americans how to do this.
The two-and-a-half-hundred wins against the pair of Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, and later returned to defeat Poulter and Roy McIlroy in 4/3 of the fourths after losing the first two holes.
In Ryder Cup history, only twice a team managed to come back from a four-point disadvantage in individual competitions, although Furyk's team's labeling team has been unsolved enough to keep the trophy.
After two days only the second best, however, a Sunday counterattack seems quite unreal.
\"Kisart: North Korea must be cut off unilaterally if you do not trust your negotiating partner
North Korea’s foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that the maintenance of sanctions only increased the untrust of the United States, and that in such circumstances the country would unilaterally surrender its nuclear weapons.
Ri Jongho said at the annual General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea has taken significant and massive steps – during the last year, for example, halting nuclear and missile experiments, closing the site of nuclear experiments, and promising that it would not expand its nuclear arsenal and the scope of nuclear technology.
“We do not see similar responses from Americans,” he said.
“In the absence of confidence in America, we feel that the security of our nation is not guaranteed, and in such circumstances it is impossible to eliminate it unilaterally and first.”
Although Ri re-expressed North Korea's disappointment about Washington's resistance to the \"strict-sacrific\" nuclear decommission idea, which, according to a scenario, would receive North Korea's rewards for the so far, his statement seemed important, however, because he did not clearly reject unilateral nuclear decomposition, as Phenjan has done so far.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jonggun and Donald Trump at the first summit between a US President in power and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, and during which Kim promised that “the Korean Peninsula’s nuclear decommission” would work, while Trump guaranteed North Korea’s inviolability.
North Korea is trying to make an official point at the end of the 1950-53 Korean war, but according to the United States, Phenjan must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has not allowed strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“America insists that we start with nuclear decommissions and increase pressure to force our will, and also protests against the fact that the war is closed,” Ri said.
The idea that we can be forced to kneel with sanctions is a desire for those who do not know us.
The problem is that non-relieving sanctions only increase our suspicions.
Ri did not mention that he would be planning a second summit between Kim and Trump, however, which the President of the United Nations spoke separately at the beginning of the week.
The minister pointed out that three meetings had taken place between Kim and the South Korean President Mun Dzein in the last five months, adding: “If the country involved in nuclear evacuation were South Korea, not the United States, then the nuclear decommission of the Korean peninsula would not have been in such a situation.”
Nevertheless, the voice of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he announced at the UN General Assembly that the target of the North American continent was inevitable with North Korean missiles after Trump, \"the evil president, Kimet, a rocket man,\" called himself a suicide mission.
This year, in the United Nations, Trump, who has threatened North Korea with full destruction last year, threatened Kim with praise that he has the courage to take steps towards the evacuation, but also noted that there is still a lot of work to be done and that the sanctions will remain until North Korea has completed its nuclear decommission.
Wednesday, Trump said they didn’t set time limits, that is, “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council could reward Phenjan for the steps that have been taken so far.
On the other hand, the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, said at the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The sanctions of the Security Council must be strictly observed until we understand the actual, final, proven nuclear evacuation.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously maintained sanctions against North Korea in order to reduce the financing of Phenjan’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Rí at the end of the UN General Assembly, and then said he would return to Phenjan in the next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has not been very well.
After leaving Phenjan in July, he announced that progress had been made, but North Korea later accused him of “gender-like claims.”
In the course of the meeting with Mun this month, North Korea promised to take down a missile base and a nuclear facility if the United States also took appropriate steps.
According to Mun, the steps mentioned by Kim would be security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore or steps that could lead to the normalization of the relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are taught to rest enough
The Harvard University has a new subject this year to turn students into more sleep, also fighting the culture of caffeine-heated whole-night learning to gain more and more space to win the macho culture.
A academic concluded that students from the world’s top university are often completely lost when it comes to how they should care about themselves.
The course, which he thought was the first such training in the U.S., was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler, who taught sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and practiced as a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
He encouraged the development of the course to perform an earlier presentation on the impact of sleep-loss on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why do I face this only now, as a graduate?’
He said no one ever told him about the importance of sleep that surprised him,\" he told Telegraph.
During the first course this year, students will be informed of the fundamental impact of proper sleep habits on their study and sports performance, in addition to the positive effects of their general public.
According to Paul Barreira, professor of Psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine, and director of the University’s Health Service, the university decided to start the course because during seven students were found to be extremely unscrupulous.
The one-hour course also includes a series of interactive tasks.
For example, in one of them, they show a picture of a college room where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, gym shoes and books to get acquainted with the effects of caffeine and light, by how sports performance affects sleeplessness, and why it is important for a bedtime routine.
In another part, participants are told how long-term sleep loss increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the university's field with interactive icons will be presented to enable participants to think about daily routines.
“We know that we will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we think you have the right to this knowledge, as well as you have the right to understand the health effects of smoking,” Professor Czeisler said.
The culture in which it is expected to study performance one night, he said, adding that the constant pressure on modern technology and students will result in growing problems.
Sufficient and high quality sleep protects students from ‘sacrific weapons’ in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even obesity, as sleep-depression forces the brain into a starving way and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler in the development of the course, a 19-year-old California student who studied chemistry and biophysics, and last year he first took one of the professor's courses on Harvard.
He said that those who heard it opened their eyes and encouraged him to arm themselves with the introduction of a university-level training.
It hopes that as a next step, postgraduate students will also be able to participate in a similar training program before they are located in the competition sector.
Professor Czeisler suggested that students set up a warning to lie down, wake up and meet the harmful effects of electric screens and LED light sources, which can easily break them out of daily rhythm and make it difficult for the sleeper to sleep.
Livingston – Rangers 1-0: Menga defeats Gerrard's men and gets a goal
Rangers suffered another alien defeat when Dolly Menga bombed Steven Gerrard's team to defeat 1-0 in Livingston.
The Ibroxians tried to get their first foreign victory after the 4-1 victory in St. Johnstone, but Gerrard suffered his second defeat from Gary Holt's team as the manager of the 18 matches. So the Ladbrokes Premiership (Scot Championship) was held at eight points from the first position of the Hearts.
Menga hit me seven minutes before the half-time, and the Rangers' unmotivated team hasn't been close to balancing.
While the Rangers got to the sixth place, Livingston caught up to the third, just because of the difference between the goals, left behind from the Hibernian.
In addition, Rangers can face additional difficulties, after the coastmark Calum Spence has been subjected to medical care due to its head injury due to an object that is likely to be dropped from the front of the guests.
Gerrard changed at eight points on the team that got into Betfred's premiere with Ayr's stroke.
Holt was in the race with the same 11 people of Livingston, who took a point from Hearts last week, and he would certainly have been happy to look at the game of his perfect team where he was able to play.
Although Rangers led the ball-breaking, Livingston took more of what he acquired.
They could've gotten the first two minutes when he launched Scott Pittman at Allan McGregor's gate with Menga's first injection, but the midfielder couldn't sell the bar.
Keaghan Jacobs landed on Craig Halket's team captain, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow only hit the gate side.
The Rangers took control of it, but there was more hope in their game in the last third than self-confidence.
Alfredo Morelos clearly felt he deserved to be a criminal in the fifteenth minutes when he collided with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson got rid of the Colombian complaints.
Rangers could only show up to the first two half-time gates, but the weak shot of Lasana Coulibaly and Ovie Ejaria by former ibroxi gateman Liam Kelly.
While Liv's attempt was in the 34th minute, he was faced with the game's ride, no one can deny that they deserve the chance, even for their hard work.
The Rangers again missed a bully forced by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher put the ball in Scott Robinson, who was great at finding Menga for easy completion.
Gerrard decided in the break, Coulibalyt was replaced by Ryan Kentre, and it almost immediately explained its impact on the game when he jumped the extreme Morelost, but the fascinating form was blocked in Kelly's time.
Livingston continued to play a game that met him, and Lithgow and Halket were sweeping up the long balls.
Holt's team could have had a bigger advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor had a good grip on the net and hit Jacobs' position before Lithgow would have made him out of a corner.
As a Rangers exchange, Glenn Middleton tried to fight another eleven when he got in contact with Jacobs, but Thomson was not convinced.
Almanach: inventor of the Geiger calculator
One detail of the morning of our almanach, September 30, 1882, is now exactly 136 years ago... the day when the later physicist, John Wilhelm-Hans- Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that could have been created by a device known as the Geiger calculator.
The Geiger Accountant has been one of the main tools of science since then, and thanks to the 1950 film, strange cowboy scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, “Bells of Coronado” (Coronado bells) has become part of pop culture:
Man: “What is this miracle?
Rogers: “This is a Geiger calculator. Radioactive minerals such as uranium can be sought with it.
If you put this headphone on, you can hear the sound of the atoms that are released because of the radioactivity of minerals.
Evans: “Be careful, now it’s a big deal.
He died in 1945 just a few days before his 63th birthday.
However, he continues to live in the invention of his name.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to \"see\" the abnormal cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “fill” and destroy abnormal cells
As part of a treatment, a vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize abnormal cells.
The method is part of the need to get the immune cells out of the patient and then change them in a laboratory.
Thus, they can “see” the protein that is accompanied by a variety of cancers. The treated immune cells are injected back into the patient.
An experimental vaccine has achieved promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect abnormal cells could say goodbye to her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method is part of the recovery of immune cells from the patient; their modification in the laboratory is to “see” the protein called HER2, which is a common companion of several types of cancer disease; and then the replanting of cells.
Jay Berzofsky, professor of the American Research Institute (Bethesda, Maryland), said: “Our findings allow us to conclude that there is a very promising vaccine in our possession.
The HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and rectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method, based on the fact that the immune cells are removed and “teached” them to attack cancer cells, was previously used successfully in the treatment of one of the types of leukemia.
Kanye West SNL, who wore the MAGA cap, was starred in a Trump supporter's wing.
It didn't go too well.
Kanye West was blown out in Saturday Night Live after an uninterrupted demonstration of President Donald Trump and announced that he would apply for the President's post in 2020.
After making the third song of Ghost Town on the cover of America Great Again, he began to speak against the Democrats and again stressed that Trump supported Trump.
“Sometimes when I talk to someone who is white, I ask the question, “How can you like Trump, because he is racist?”
If I were interested in racism, I would have moved from America,\" he said.
The SNL's show was opened to a parody by Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star star named Brett Kavanaugh, made his testimony to the Senate's Justice Committee on the charges of sexual harassment of Christine Blasay Ford.
Although it wasn’t broadcast, Chris Rock’s humorist posted a video of West’s speech on social media.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to run a gun from West with the upload.
West even complained to the audience that he was being pushed behind the scenes for his hat.
“They were scarred behind the scenes.
They said, “Don’t go out in that hat.”
They scared me!
And they said that I was in the sank place,\" Washington Examiner said.
West continued: “Do you want to see the space you have? I'm going to wear my Superman cape, because that means they can't say what to do.
Try with love –
At least twice his manifestations were accompanied by a whistleblower from the audience, and the SNL's participants were apparently embarrassed by one of the witnesses who said to Variety: \"The entire studio was silenced,\"
Instead of the singer of Westet Ariana Grande, she was invited at the last moment, whose former friend Mac Miller rapper died a few days ago.
West asked questions when the song I Love it was made dressed up as Perrier glasses.
Westet, director of the conservative TPUSA Group, Candace Turner, guaranteed support in a tweet: “One of the bravest spirits: THE REFUGE, THE REFUGE OF THE REFUGE
Karen Hunter, host of a conversation show, tweeted that West was simply “his own, and that’s great.”
“But I decided not to reward someone (with the purchase of music or fashion articles or with the support of his “artist”), who I believe will be recognized as having an ideology that is harmful to the community to which I belong.
He's free.
But we, too, added it to him.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, now he’s “the creature they previously known as Kanye West.”
He's not the first artist to change his name, and then he goes into Diddy's prints, which we know as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P. Diddy.
His rapper, Snoop Dogg, also recorded the name Snoop Lion, and, of course, his late legend, Prince, also changed his name to a symbol, and then to the artist known as Prince.
The Belfast restaurant delayer is accused of attempted murder.
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was buried at a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
According to the police statement, the case occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant must stand before the Belfast City Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, star of the Battle of Thrones, finds it harmful to the exaggerated masculine
Kit Harington is most known as the Battle of Thrones as Jon Snow, and in the middle-aged fantasy series of HBO violence it is often a sword itself.
The 31-year-old actor, however, spoke against the stereotypical macho heroes, highlighting that, in view of such heroes, young boys may often feel that hard action is needed to fight respect.
In his statement to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that “something went wrong” and asked the question of how the problem of the harmful effects of exaggerated manhood in the #MeToo era could be addressed.
The star, who recently married her 31-year-old, series-old colleague Rose Leslie, said she thought it was very important to fix the problem.
“Does this matter affect us personally quite deeply – how has it been distorted by such a manifestation of manhood?” the actor asked.
What we taught men in their childhood about the problem we are facing now.
According to Kit, television is also responsible for spreading the distorted image of masculinity, because the shows often feature very masculine characters.
He added: “What is it that was born with us, and what is it that we learn?
What does street and TV say to young boys that make them feel like they can only be men in this way?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time – and how we can change it.
Because it clearly shows that something is wrong with young men.”
Kit stated in the interview that after the summer season of the series, he will not be included in the Trojans' series of battles or events, because he “has the mind of the warriors and the horses.”
From November, he will play a major role in the reprocessing of Kit Sam Shepard True West’s film, which is about a producer and his brother who continues to be a thief.
The actor said that the best thing he had received from the Battle of the Throne was his wife, Rose, whom he knew during the series.
“I met my wife on the set, so I can thank my future family and my future life for the series,” said Kit.
Rose Ygritte, who had love for Kit's character Jon Snow in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: The number of new patients in China increased by 14%
China reported that the number of HIV and AIDS-based citizens in the country increased by 14%.
According to health officials, this means more than 820 000 people.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, the number of reported cases increased by about 40,000.
Compared to the previous, a significant majority of newly infected people get the disease by sexual means.
The disease was spread rapidly by blood transfusions in some parts of China.
However, health officials at a conference in the province of Jünnan said that the number of such cases had fallen to almost zero since then.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increased by 100,000 compared to the previous year in China.
Giving HIV sexually is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been no crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against society has been very strong.
Based on estimates in various studies, 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry a woman because of the conservative trend in the country.
In these relationships, the disease spreads in many cases due to inadequate sexual protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has been providing universal access to anti-HIV medicines as part of the problem-solving programme.
Maxine Waters denies that one of his crew members would have leaked data from Republican senators and condemned “serious lies and conspiracy theories”
On Saturday, American MP Maxine Waters rejected the allegations that a member of his crew had published three Republican senators' personal data on the Senators' Wikipedia page.
According to the Democratic MP in Los Angeles, these statements were disseminated by experts and websites from “the widest side of the world.”
“A lie, a lie, and more lying lies,” Waters wrote on Twitter.
The information provided was reported to include the address and telephone number of Senator Lindsey Graham in South Carolina, and Senator Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch in Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday. The person of the publisher is unknown, but it is certain that they were published on Capitolum, during the Senate hearing of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative pages, such as Gateway Pundi and RedState, are linked to the source IP address Waters' office and also reported data about one of the members of Waters' staff, writes The Hill.
“These charges are completely unfounded, false, and obviously liars,” Waters continued.
My staff is not responsible for leaking information. However, the right to anonymity, protection of personal data and security has been violated due to fraud and false accusations.
These charges are completely unfounded, false, and obviously liars.
Waters' statements on the Internet were soon criticized, and among the critics was Ari Fleischer, the former press secretary of the White House.
“This is an angry denial,” Fleischer wrote.
Based on this, it seems that Waters does not have the blood temperature necessary for the representative position.
If someone is convicted of something he didn't do, he can't react angryly to it.
You can't behave badly.
You can't question the defendant's motives.
They need to stay calm and calm.
Waters' reaction seems to have been compared to Judge Kavanaugh's reaction to the democratic criticisms of the party, who, according to some critics, seemed too angry at the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for the election of Waters in mid-term elections, also shared his opinion on Twitter.
“If it is true, it is serious,” he wrote in his message.
Waters, in his statement, wrote that his office informed the \"adequate authorities and law enforcement authorities\" about false accusations.
“We believe that the offender’s person will become aware – continued by Waters – and that they are legally held responsible for all acts that endanger or harass any member of my staff.”
Johnny English strikes again, or Rowan Atkinson's paralytic spy game
Today, it has become a legacy that we are looking for references to Brexit in every British-related film, and there is no exception to this, which is a part of Johnny English category, which can be classified as an action game/parodia category, the first part of which, Johnny English 2003, was refilled in 2011 and the second part of Johnny English.
Will the new export product of the British nation become the sarcastic, paradosizing satires in which we live on our own, manifest paralyzing?
It is so certain that the eyes had enough mutations for a new return with a rigid, rubber-shaped, incapacitant Johnny English – it is clear from his name that this comic character has been created to make it known to the masses of viewers in the cinemas of non-English native countries.
Johnny English, of course, is a dirty secret agent who thinks he's a bit of a winner with bizarre motivation, so reminds him of Detective Clouseau, sometimes Mr. Bean, and sometimes of the guy who contributed with a single keyboard printing to the performance of the main title of Firefighters at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
Originally, the character is based on the mysterious international traveler Atkinson once played in an old-timely-defeated state of Barclaycard, who left chaos everywhere.
There's a good moment in the last Johnny English movie.
I loved it as Johnny English dressed in medieval armor, approaching a helicopter, and then reaching the rotors knocked on his helmet for a few minutes.
Atkinson’s comedy veins are well valid in the film, but the humor of the film is not really working, even superfluous, because today, it’s like James Bond movies or the Mission Impossible series are bravely touching the instrument of humor.
To feel that the humor of the film is more focused on children, and to me, Johnny English flairy, successful adventures do not achieve the level of imagination and genius that Atkinson brings to me in the silent scenes of the Mr. Bean series.
The starting point of the film is hereditary: Britain is in serious danger.
A cybercriminal broke into the super secret online network of the British spy network and revealed the identity of all British agents to Kevin Eldon's biggest nightmare, who unfortunately only received such a small role in the film.
This may be the last angle to the coffin of the self-sacrificing and sharing prime minister whose political popularity is in ruins: Emma Thompson practically forms Theresa May, and everything from the otherwise poorly written character.
Intelligence advisors show him that, since all active agents have been identified, he has to put a tranquilized agent on the job.
This calmed agent is, of course, Johnny English, who has been working as a teacher since his retirement, but, unlike teaching material, teaches the children to spy – here, of course, there are funny scenes, while English amphibians describe the basics of espionage.
English is quickly transported to Whitehall, where, at the emergency briefing, you will meet with your former, long-painted military carrier, Bough, who is now being formed by Ben Miller.
Bough has been married since then, and has married a submarine captain, whose mouth is always in the ear – the Captain Vicki Pepperdine, who has called for much better roles.
So his Majesty’s two-pronged “Batman and Robin” couple will return to action and face Ophelia Bulletova, whom Olga Kurylenko forms, as a true woman of destiny.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is increasingly entrenched by the charismatic IT billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s digital problems: his name is Jason Volta, and Jake Lacy forms it.
English and Bough begin their clown mission: they fire a puddle French restaurant, and then, in the midst of an amazing revolution, they embroide themselves on Volta’s luxury yacht, and English frees the hell from reality when using a VR-headset to try to get to know Volta’s apartment.
These stations need us to get to the final stage, but any kind of fun and turning, maybe it's too much of a child's movie impression.
The final result is rather medium.
As with the other Johnny English movies, the question has already been raised: Can the British film industry finally play a worthy role in Rowan Atkinson?
The British Labour Party denies that it will introduce a four-day working week while paying the UK for five-day wages.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is working on a radical plan: the introduction of a four-day work week, all of which would be used by workers for a five-day salary.
The party claims that the workers would also benefit from the benefits of the artificial intelligence (MI) revolution, so that corporate leaders would provide extra free days for workers thanks to increased income.
On the basis of the plan, employees would receive a three-day weekend while taking home the same as before.
According to the sources, the idea would fit into the party’s economic program, which aims to target the balance language on the side of the workers in the country.
The four-day work week is supported by the Congress of Trade Unions, so workers can profit from the changing economy.
One of the senior officials of the Labour Party said to the Sunday Times: “It is likely that the policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
Although it will not happen from one day to another, the four-day work week is an idea that fits well into the party’s program that would fit the balance sheet language towards the workers in the economy, it also fits into the overall industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party campaigned four-day working week in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, the idea does not enjoy the support of the Labour Party as a whole.
The Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-day work week does not belong to the policies supported by the party, and the question is not yet on the agenda.”
John McDonnell, Minister of Defence, presented his idea of the socialist revolution on the economy at the Labour Party Conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to fight to regain power from “unfortunate directors” and the “resistants” of the regime.
If the plans of the shadow finance minister were carried out, the shareholders of the water service companies would not be able to recover the total profits due to them, a Labour Party government would make it possible to punish the alleged harmful activities.
McDonnell also confirmed that, according to his plans, he would also make workers a member of the Board of Directors and would create Inclusive Ownership Funds, which would account for 10% of private companies’ shares to be grouped to employees, who would thus be able to obtain 500 important dividends each year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy announced on the “60 Minutes” show that the FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could change their opinion.
As a result of an FBI investigation against the charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, at least one week later than the original date, the final vote on the election of Kavanaugh to the Supreme Judge will be held. The question is whether the result of the investigation could insure Republican Members so much to support Kavanaugh.
In his interview with “60 Minutes” on Sunday, journalist Scott Pelley asked reporter John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham Republican senators about whether the FBI could find something to think about.
Kennedy was less committed than his South Carolina colleague.
\"I understand, of course,\" Kennedy said.
That's what I said before the hearing, I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called after the incident exploded, after the accusations appeared, and I asked, \"Did you do it?\"
His response was strong and clear.
Graham's vote seems to be concrete.
“I’ve already decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and I need extremely serious accusations to think about myself,” Graham said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know Brett strongly denied the claims,” said Graham, titled Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the people named by Dr. Ford proved the charges.
It's a 36-year-old story.
I don't think anything new is going to happen.
What is the Global Citizens Festival and has it managed to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, the annual music event in New York, the Global Citizens Festival, will begin in New York. World stars will perform for a truly noble purpose: the global eradication of poverty.
The Global Citizens Festival is now held on Wednesday, with tens of thousands of Central Park’s Great Posit, where participants can not only enjoy the performance of Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but can also draw attention to the real purpose of the event: the elimination of deep poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival was first held in 2012 as part of the Global Poverty Project. The project is run by an international interest group aimed at eliminating poverty by actively involving more people in the fight against poverty.
You can get a free ticket to the concert (unless you are willing to pay for VIP tickets) to perform certain tasks or transactions, such as taking a volunteer job, sending an email to a leading politician, a phone call, or any other useful activity that may draw attention to the purpose of eliminating poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizens been in achieving the objectives set for the past 12 years?
Is it really an effective way to reward people with concerts to convince others about the importance of action, or is it just a new form of \"clitivism\" when people feel they have contributed to a case by signing or writing an online petition?
Since 2011, more than 19 million actions have been carried out by the supporters of the project, serving a number of different objectives.
According to the organization, these actions contributed to the world's leaders' allocation of $37 billion to policies and commitments against poverty, which can affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group claimed that it was based on its commitments and announcements, including $10 billion already paid or collected during the fundraising.
According to the group estimates, the money collected has been directly affected by the lives of nearly 649 million people.
The main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership between UK-based investors and contractors, which aims to “help children achieve the potential within them – the organization pledged $35 million to help Rwanda eliminate hunger after receiving more than 4700 Twitter messages from “global citizens”
“With the support of the UK government and donors, national governments and similar global citizens, we can ban social injustice and malnutrition from the footnotes to the history books,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also claims that, after more than 5,000 actions were requested to improve the food of the UK for mothers and children, the government has allocated resources to the Power of Nutrition project, which will improve the feeding of 5 million women and children.
One of the many questions published on the Global Citizens website is: “Why do you think deep poverty can be eliminated?
According to the Global citizen’s answer, “There will be a long and difficult path, which sometimes we will be stuck and sometimes we will fail.
But like the previous civil rights and anti-segregation movements, we also achieve our goal because we are stronger together.
Among other things, Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae will perform at this year's New York event, and the show leaders will be Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Minister of Home Affairs: the US Navy block would be used to prevent Russian energy exports
\"If necessary, Washington would take either the Navy into the Russian energy industry, for example, the Middle East would not have access to Russian energy,\" said US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke, Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russia’s active presence in Syria, in particular as regards Russian operations at the request of the legitimate Syrian government, is just an excuse for Russia to acquire new energy markets.
“I think they’re only there in the Middle East because they want to sell energy there, as they do in Eastern Europe and in the south of Europe,” Zinke said in a statement.
And the Minister of Home Affairs says there are ways to block Russians.
“The United States is able to ensure that sea routes are open and can block them if necessary, so that Russia’s energy can not enter markets,” Zinke said.
Zinke has taken his words to the participants of a non-profit group called Consumer Energy Alliance – the nonprofit group, by the way, defines itself as “the voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
In his speech he compared Washington's action against Russia and Iran and noted that it was practically the same method.
“Iran and Russia can be sanctioned economically almost the same: using existing energy carriers and introducing new ones,” Zinke said, while calling Russia “a single-dimensional economy,” pointing out the country’s dependence on fossil energy carriers.
The statements are consistent with the Trump government's plan to export LNG to Europe, thus removing Russia from the market, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
That is why Trump government officials, including the president themselves, will convince Germany to back up the project called the Northern Stream 2 “unorthodox” behind which, if carried out, will then make Moscow a “shot hostage” Germany.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the existing capacity is doubled, with an increase of 110 billion cubic metres in Northern Stream 2 wires of only economic nature.
According to the Kremlin, Washington opposes such a project from economic considerations, which is the manifestation of unfair competition.
\"I suspect that we are in the same position that energy should not be used for pressure exercise and that consumers should be given the opportunity to choose their suppliers freely,\" said Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak, after a September meeting with the US Minister of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow.
The attempt to convince Americans went backwards, because Germany confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the German Industry Association (BDI), has called on the United States not to intervene in EU energy policy, as is the case with the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I find it problematic when a third country intervenes in our energy affairs,” said Dieter Kempf, chairman of the German Industry Association (BDI) after Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin’s last meeting.
Senator Elizabeth Warren takes a serious consideration to launch the presidency in 2020.
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the midterm elections, “it takes a lot of consideration – to start for the presidency.
Warren Massachusetts, at a Hollywood City Assembly, confirmed that he was considering the departure.
\"It's time for women to get into Washington and fix the bad-working government, and it's time for a woman to be president,\" Warren said.
After 6 November, I am seriously considering going to the presidency.
At the city meeting, Donald Trump was in criticism of Warren, and he said that he was taking the country in a \"bad direction\".
“I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy,” Warren said.
Warren criticized Trump and Brett Kavanaugh's top court candidate.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote, “Well, of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
Based on a survey published on Thursday, however , the majority of Warren's masschusettsi voters do not think Warren should start for the presidency in 2020.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolki's Political Analysis Centre and Boston Globe, Warren's \"good chance\", 58% of the voters in Massachusetts voted that the Senator should not go for the presidency, while
32% support Warren's presidential election.
Based on the survey, Deval Patrick's former presidential candidate would be largely supported by 38% and 48% would be opposed.
As regards the presidential election in 2020, among other things, the name of high-ranked Democrats, such as Joe Biden's former Vice President, or Senator Bernie Sanders' Vermont.
According to the Associated Press report, Biden decides whether to start until January.
Sarah Palin Track Palin's PTSD meeting at Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Track Palin served in Iraq for a year after applying in September
He was arrested for domestic violence on Monday night.
“When my son goes through what he has been going home, I understand the other families who experience the terrible consequences of PTSD, and the wounds that our soldiers come home with,” said Sarah Palin, at the meeting of the audience at Donald Trump Oklahoma.
Palin’s son’s arrest as an elephant in the room, he called it, and said that his son, like the rest of the war veterans, “reversally returned, hard-painted, and is constantly in the mind of whether or not he has given proper respect to the service of his comrades, pilots, and other members of the army for the country.”
Track Palin was arrested in Wasila, Alaska for domestic violence against a woman. Dan Bennett, the spokeswoman of the Washington police, said that Track Palin, according to a report, had committed violence within the family drunkly.
18 Member States and Washington D.C. support judicial review of asylum policy
18 Member States and Washington D.C. also support the review of the new American asylum policy to prevent refugees from fleeing violence by gangs or families.
Representatives from 18 different Member States and Washington D.C. wrote an expert letter on Friday in Washington to support a asylum seeker who attacks politics in court, writes NBC News.
The full name of the applicant for the case of Grace vs Sessions initiated against federal policy was not disclosed by the U.S. Civil Rights Union in August.
According to the plaintiff’s claim, his partner and his sons of violent crime were abused, but the U.S. officials rejected his asylum claim on July 20th.
The woman is being arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors of the states supporting Grace have written El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala into places where many asylum applications have been filed with the United States, as in these countries there is a constant problem with the violence committed by criminals and within the family.
The new U.S. asylum policy has withdrawn a 2014 decision by the Committee on the Appeal of Migrant Appals (BIA), which allowed migrants without documents to apply for asylum when they fled from domestic violence.
Karl Racine, Washington, D.C. Attorney General, stated in a statement on Friday that the new policy “was excluded from several decades of state, federal and international law.”
“By federal law, all asylum applications must be judged in accordance with the facts and circumstances in which case they exist, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” the expert letter states.
The prosecutors also explained in the letter that policy rejecting immigration harms the US economy, as immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “fill the lowest-level jobs”
In June, Advocate General Jeff Sessions ordered asylum attorneys not to give asylum to victims of domestic violence and criminal gangs.
\"The right of asylum is a matter of leaving the country for reasons of race, religion, nationality, belonging to a specific social group or for fear of persecution or persecution,\" said Sessions, on 11 June.
The right to asylum has not been found to solve all of the problems that people around the world face every day – they are of any serious nature.
Desperate rescue action in Palu, the number of dead has doubled, rescue formations are racing with time.
The situation of survivors is increasingly unexpected.
\"Everyone is very tense,\" says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, calming down the son of a feverous little boy in one of Palu's evacuation centers.
The ambulances bring the bodies every minute.
We hardly have any drinking water.
Some residents returned to their homes to save them from the wasted stuff that can still be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals that have also been damaged by a 7.5-strong earthquake are not able to beat people.
Some of the injured, including the broken-back and shoulder Dwi Harist, were transported to the Palui Military Hospital. The patients were taken outside the hospital building due to high-strengthening post-surgery.
The man’s eyes were filled with tears when he reminded him of the fifth floor hotel room in which he and his wife were possessed, and he was terrified of the devastating uprising.
“There was no time for escape.
I think I was in need of broken walls,” Haris told Associated Press, and then added that his family came to town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife cry for help, and then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe.
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of consuming the country with propaganda ads
The U.S. ambassador accused Beijing of spreading propaganda in the U.S. press. This happened a week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement on an American daily newspaper that stressed the mutual benefits of American-China trade relations.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump referred to the announcement of China Daily Des Moines Register – Iowa’s largest number of copies – while he accused China of attempting to intervene in the US Congress elections on 6 November.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to intervene in the US elections, according to some U.S. officials who report to Reuters, is a new stage in Washington's more and more intense action against China to put China under pressure.
Although it is not unusual for foreign governments to promote trade with their country through advertising, there is an increasingly intense trade war between Beijing and Washington, during which they impose new and new duties on each other’s import products.
According to American and Chinese experts, at the beginning of the trade war, the Chinese customs authorities sought to target exporters from countries where Trump and the Republican Party are popular, such as Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the United States Ambassador to China and Iowa’s former leader for several cycles, said Beijing was harming American workers, farmers and businesses, as Iowa’s state exports a significant amount of agricultural product to China.
Branstad wrote in his statement at Des Moines Register on Sunday that “China continues to shake our country by publishing propaganda ads in our free press.”
“The Chinese government is taking advantage of the American tradition of freedom of speech and press, by spreading propaganda in paid ads placed in Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
However, if we go to a Beijing journalist, we can hardly find critical articles. The Chinese press does not truly reflect the different opinions of Chinese people on the ever-increasing growth prospects of the Chinese economy, since the media is under strict control of the Communist Party of China.
Branstad added that “One of China’s most famous newspapers refused to serve, his article, but did not mention the newspaper.
Republicans say that Republicans can detract women voters before midterm elections with the Kavanaugh scandal.
According to analysts, many high-ranking Republican politicians can defend Brett Kavanaugh’s top court candidate in the cross-border attack of sexual harassment charges. In particular, women voters can lose their support before semi-aged elections.
The case triggered intense emotions, and most Republicans publicly declared that they would continue to vote for Kavanaugh.
These statements cannot be taken back, according to Grant Reeher, a politician working in the institution of Maxwell School at the University of Szirarakusa, in one of the Saturday articles of The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts about the fact that the last-minute FBI printing by Jeff Flake Republican Senator in Arizona would be enough to comfort angry voters.
\"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, neither tomorrow nor November,\" said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national spokesman for the Progressive Group MoveOn on Friday, according to a Washington, D.C. newspaper.
According to Mic's report, on Friday morning, some protesters in the Senate corridor were saying, \"There is no way to withdraw Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of the Justice Committee under Republican control.
“Excellently, democratic enthusiasm and motivation will jump,” Stu Rothenberg said.
“A lot of people say it’s been so high, and that’s true.
But it may be even higher, especially among the insecure women voters in the suburbs and young people (18-29 years old) who, although not enthusiastic about the president, often do not vote.
Analysts had already assumed before Ford's public testimony that he could return to Republicans, if they continue to stand up for the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh. Since then, Ford described in his statement why he accused the supreme court candidate with sexual harassment.
“The Republican Party was wrong on an intensive soil,” said the former President of the Republican National Commission, Michael Steele, at the beginning of the week.
“It is not only about the Commission’s vote and the final vote, but also about the way the Republicans dealt with the matter, and as they behaved with Ford,” said Guy Cecil, director of the United States of America, helping to elect Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans were fairly divided into whether Ford or Kavanaugh’s testimony was true.
According to a new survey by YouGov, 41% of respondents fully or more believed in Ford’s testimony, and 35% of respondents in Kavanaugh gave the same response.
In addition, 38% of respondents believe that Kavanaugh was likely or certainly lying in his testimony, while only 30% of respondents believed that about Ford.
As a result of Flake's motion, the FBI is currently investigating the credibility of Ford's claims, as Kavanaugh's other accuser, Deborah Ramirez's statements, writes in Guardian.
Ford swore a week ago before the Senate Committee on Justice that he was harassed by Kavanaugh, a 17-year-old drunk.
Ramirez said the top court candidate showed him his sex organ at a party in the 1980s when they both studied at Yale.
The global web inventor would start a new internet to face Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built on Berners-Lee’s open source platform, Solid.
With Solid, users can choose where they want to store their data and who can access each information.
In his exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that the intention behind Inrupt was “to gain control over the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said.
It's a historic moment.
The app, using Solid technology, allows people to create their own “personal online data store” and also called POPS.
It may include lists, toy lists, calendars, music libraries, as well as other personal and professional tools.
This is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Black and Spotify from the same browser at the same time.
In the personal online data store, it is unique that the user can decide who can access the data in full.
The company calls it \"the exercise of the right of self-determination over the data of persons\".
According to John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, the company is responsible for ensuring resources, processes and adequate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contractors working in the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week onwards, the world’s technology developers will be able to create their own decentralized applications using tools available on Inrupt’s side.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don’t ask “Facebook and Google to take the full-change technology that would put the business models of companies on top of their heads from one day to another”
“We don’t ask for permission from them.”
In a statement published on the Mediterranean Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the sending of Inrupt is a commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the newly built network of Solidra.
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Technical University.
Berners-Lee has been an important advocate of opinion in recent months in discussions on Internet neutrality.
Despite the launch of the Intruct, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am absolutely optimistic about the next era of the world network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann Viktória was celebrated as a pastor in the First World War
The only Viktória cross was celebrated by England’s pastor, 100 years after the first World War.
Bernard Vann, arguable and alezres, was honoured during the attack on Bellelise and Leacurt on September 29, 1918.
Four days later, however, a sniper killed him, so he could never know that he earned the highest honor of British armed forces.
The two grandchildren of the memorial festival were exposed to the celebration of the Northamptonshire County in Rushden.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that “it is symbolic” that the monument was given exactly 100 years after the act of his grandfather worthy of honor.
According to London Gazette, Bernard Vann is a respected and alerred on September 29, 1918, through the Canal de Saint-Quentin channel, he was transferred to the centre of his flag, a dense fog and a heavy cannon and machine guns.
Later, he rushed to the faceline and stood at the edge of the flag with a \"extraordinary heroism\", and then one by one rushed into a camper cannon unit, without harming its three members.
Bernard Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just one month before the end of the war.
“I know that I can never reach what my grandfather did and that taught me to be humble,” said Michael Vann, 72.
After the event led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band band, Michael Vann and his brother, Dr. James Vann, were also crowned by the monument.
Michael Vann said it was an honor to be able to play a role in the celebration and then added: “A true hero’s vision proves how many people later express their respect.”
The MMA fans were refreshed all night to watch Bellator 206 broadcasts, instead of Peppa malaco
Imagine, all night long, he was excited to watch the exciting Bellator 206, and that mediation is missing.
There were 13 battles on the San José show, six of which were broadcast live as part of the main competition in the UK, Channel 5 channel.
At 6am in the morning, while Gegard Mousasi and Rary MacDonald were just preparing to fight each other, the English viewers were not surprised by the game instead of the Peppa pig.
Many of them were having difficulty staying up until dawn because of this conflict.
Instead of the MMA game, a child cartoon film was written on Twitter by one of the fans, some kind of sick joke.
According to the state regulation, such content can no longer be transmitted at 6 a.m., and therefore they had to switch to children's shows,\" said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of Bellator's Communications and Marketing Department.
- Yes, it's Peppa, the time of the pig--
Scott Coker, the president of the Bellator company, promised that in the future, the schedule of the show would be revised to take account of the United Kingdom viewers.
“I think we can solve this by repeating it,” Coker said.
However, since it's 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, until Sunday, which is Monday, we can't fix the situation.
But we're working on it.
Believe that when the show turned over, there were a lot of messages, and then most of them weren't very friendly.
At first we thought we had a technical problem, so we tried to fix the mistake.
But that wasn't what we were talking about, it was a legal problem.
However, I can promise you this will not happen the next time.
Instead of six so far, there will only be five matches in the program – we would have liked to please the viewers, but we have counted ourselves.
It was an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley's sexual attitude to a minority complex
Tom Daley said that he felt inferior to everyone in his youth because of his sexual attitude, but he encouraged his motivation to succeed.
According to the 24-year-old athlete, until high school, he didn’t realize that “not everyone is like him.”
In Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, Lauren Laverne told the director that he would stand up for the rights of gays to give others “a chance.”
He added that since he became a parent, the Olympics are much less interested.
The permanent director of the long-time show Kirsty Young left several months behind because of the disease.
In Laverne’s first show, “as a shipbreaker,” he invited Daley to say that as a youth, everyone else felt “less,” because “he was not socially accepted if someone loved the boys and the girls, too.”
He said: “To date, the feeling of inferiority and of other things is what I draw strength and strength to achieve my successes.”
He was trying to prove that he was “anything” so that he wouldn’t disappoint everyone when the light was revealed to his sexual attitude.
The dual Olympic Bronze MoU became a well-known representative of the LGBT community and, taking advantage of its role in this year’s national community games in Australia, asked the governments of the world to decriminalize homosexuality in as many countries as possible.
He said he spoke about the case because he felt lucky that he could live his life openly, without negative consequences, and that he wanted to give others “happiness.”
The three-time world champions said that “it was completely surprised, when he fell in love with another man, the American film maker, Dustin Lance Black, who first met in 2013.
Daley and his 20-year-old Oscar-winning screenwriter were married last year, and the age difference has never been a problem among them.
“When so many things go through the young age of man, he said, “He was at the age of 14, and his father died three years later in cancer,” he found it difficult in his own age class to find someone who had similar extreme experiences.
The couple adopted a little boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June.
“If they asked me this question last year, I would have said the most important thing was to win a gold medal,” he said.
There are more important things than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal, Robbie.
The child's name was named after Daley's father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said her father didn't want her to die, and one of the last questions was whether the tickets were already on London Olympics in 2012 because she wanted to sit there in the first row.
“I had no choice to say to him, “Daddy, you will no longer be there in the first row,” he said.
“I caught his hand when he stopped breathing, but until the moment, I couldn’t accept that my father was not vulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the Olympics in 2012 and acquired my bronze medal.
“I was glad that this was what I dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a home audience at the Olympic Games, there’s no better feeling than that,” he said.
The number, Heather Small Proud (Büszke), helped her with the Olympic preparation, and she will still be a bitch if she hears it.
Desert Island Discs starts at 11:15 on the BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson was not in shape, and he was on a bench on Saturday in the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson can record that he is attending the 47th Cup on Sunday, however, he must win back the form if he does not want this milestone to remain an unpleasant experience in his memory.
Mickelson plays for the 12th time at the two-year event due to the performance of the four-ball and four-ball games on Saturday, however, the team captain Jim Furyk sent the bench.
Instead of being at the heart of five winners in the big competitions, as many times as it was necessary to fight for the victory of the United States, now in one half of the day, the team is suffocating, and the other half is exercising practice and trying to correct the mistakes that weaken the game.
At the top of the career, he never belonged to the most accurate bats, so the 48-year-old player does not really have the Le Golf National narrow track, where due to the high grass, he has to pay a very high price for the flawed punches.
And if the track in itself wasn't scary enough, Mickelson will face the four matches in the team of four of Francesco Molinari's top players this week.
If Americans starting with a four-point disadvantage before the 12 individual matches start hard, Mickelson's match can be crucial.
Furyk says he trusts the player, but what else can he say?
“He is fully aware of the role he played in today’s development. He beat my back, scratched me, and promised to be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
It's extremely confident.
It is one of the biggest and has done a lot for the team in the past and in the past week.
I basically didn't want two matches for him.
I planned more, but in the situation we decided that this is the best solution.
He wants to be on the track, just like everyone else.
With Mickelson's Sunday role, Nick Faldo's record will be overthrown by Nick Faldo, who hasn't played more games in the Ryder Cup.
With this, you can close a series of Ryder Cups that are far behind the player’s individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats, and seven draw-offs, but Furyk has highlighted that the presence of a veteran player has no tangible advantages for the team.
“He’s a huge, sarcastic, witty, he likes to joke with others, he’s a great team member,” he explained.
I think younger players also enjoyed playing against him, and it's good to see that.
His presence goes beyond the game in a strict sense.
Thomas Bjørn, Captain of the European Team, is aware that they can easily lose their benefits.
Thomas Bjørn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that even if someone has a significant advantage for the last day of the Ryder Cup, he can easily turn his back on his luck.
The Danish player introduced the 1997 Valderrama match for the first time, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros gained a five-point advantage against the Americans, and at the end they managed to maintain a strand of benefits for the winnings of 141-2 to 31-2.
“We always need to remind ourselves that we did not get much advantage in Valderrama, but we won only with a huge amount of hair, and we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we finally got out,” Bjørn said in the picture after the 2018 class’s 5-3 Friday and yesterday’s victory, which led to the Le Golf National Tour.
We think about the competitions of previous years, and everyone can see that the game is not over.
You have to play with full force tomorrow.
So come on and do everything you need to win.
We can't relax until the points get up on the table.
We have a goal that is nothing but to win this trophy, and now we only have to focus on that.
As I said before, I’m most concerned with 12 players in our team, but we also need to pay attention to the other side of those who happen to be among the world’s biggest players.
Bjørn, proud of the team’s performance on the hard track, added: “I would never make predictions in such a situation.
Tomorrow is a completely different pasta.
Then everything depends on individual performances, which is completely different from team games.
It feels great to play in a couple when things go well, but when you stand out individually, you will find out what a golfer really is.
This is what you need to understand with the players that tomorrow they will bring the best out of themselves on the track.
They have to cut off from their partner, who will also have to make the best of it.
Unlike Bjørn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the opponent's team expressly trusts that his players will perform more individually than in pairs, except for the two of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who earned three of the four points.
Furyk said he had already experienced both sides of the last day’s resurrections: in Brookline he was a member of the winning team, and then on the losing side of the European team, as a miracle in Medinah, after the outstanding performance of the Bravour.
“I remember all the damn words,” he answered when he was asked because he encouraged the players before the last day in 1999 by Captain Ben Crenshaw.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we’re doing the best we can in Brookline, as we saw in Medinah.
If one of the teams really jumps in, it puts the opponent's players under huge pressure during the middle matches.
We put together the order accordingly and prepared our players to perform a real miracle tomorrow.
Thomas was given the task of standing at the forefront of the quest to reverse the job and playing against Rory McIlroy at the first match, then in line with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the first half of the European team.
“I also decided to follow the order, because I think that’s how the picture came together from the beginning to the end,” Bjørn added.
Germany's latest warship has been postponed again.
The German Navy's latest frigate was to be served in 2014 to replace the rising Cold War warships, but due to various system failures and exponentially increasing costs, this would still be waiting for you for at least next year.
The wild-new Baden-Württemberg-class fregatts' flagship, “Rheinland-Pfalz” was postponed to the first half of 2019, wrote the Die Zeit weekly newspaper, quoting one of the spokespersons of the army.
According to the original plan, the ship should have joined the naval bond in 2014, but the continuous delays have made it very difficult for the fate of the large-scale project.
In 2007, the Navy ordered the four Baden-Württemberg-class ships in the place of the Brema-classing Fregats.
We know that there will be a high fire-power cannon on it, as well as a range of air and water-vehicle missiles and disguised technology, including a signal absorber that reduces the radar, infrared and acoustic signs of the ship.
Another important feature is that it is less often necessary for maintenance, which in practice means that these latest frigates can be placed in service for up to two years away from mothers.
However, due to the ongoing slip of the project, these high-tech warships, with which Germany could feel its power overseas, may have become obsolete when they are finally declared in service, noted Die Zeit.
The heavy-earth F125 fregate was released last year when the German Navy officially refused to initiate the vehicle and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship to the manufacturer.
There is not much information about the causes of the return, but the German media has made several critical “software and hardware mistakes,” which make the warship useless in a combat mission.
Software shortcomings are a major problem, as only 120 sailors on Baden-Württemberg class ships will serve only half of the crew of the old Brema class.
It has also been revealed that the ship is extremely overweight, which undermines its performance and makes it impossible for the Navy to make further changes later.
The 7000-tonne-Rheinland-Pfalz is said to be twice as heavy as the Germans set up in World War II for a similar class of ships.
Apart from defective parts, the increase in the total cost of the project, including the training of the crew, is a growing problem.
According to some sources, the cost of the project has already reached an amazing EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion) while the initial draft accounted for EUR 2.2 billion.
In light of the problems with new frigates, it is of particular importance that Germany's sea presence is declining.
Hans-Peter Bartels, president of the German Parliament’s National Defence Committee, recently admitted that the Navy “is running out of the state of warships that can be taken out of the warships.
According to the public officer, the problem has changed into a self-sacrificing process in the meantime, because old ships had to be installed, but there are no more ships to compensate for the losses.
He expressed concern about the fact that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates could join the Navy bond.
National Trust is searching for the secret life of bats
New research is being conducted on a Scottish-earth estate, which aims to find out how bats use the characteristics of the landscape while hunting.
Researchers hope that the results can provide new information on the behavior of single flying mammals, which can also benefit from later species conservation initiatives.
Scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will examine the behavior of ordinary and so-called dwarf brothers and brown long-sleeved bats and water bats in the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
At the appropriate points of the area, special reception tools are placed to record the activities of bats during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will collect mobile data with manual detectors.
A detailed analysis of the sound of the recordings can determine the frequency of denerial sounds and what species is doing.
Researchers are also preparing a habitat map and report, which can be used to determine in detail how the behavior of animals develops depending on the landscape.
According to Rob Dewar, the NTS nature adviser, the results will reveal the most important habitats for bats and how the species uses them.
This information will help to determine the beneficial effects of habitat management work, such as the formation of branches, and how to best preserve forest areas for bats and other species concerned.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the size of batting populations has decreased significantly over the last century.
Buildings and regional development work interfere with the sleeping areas of animals and reduce their living space.
Wind turbines and public lighting are also a risk factor for them, as is the case with put-out beads, certain chemical processes used for building materials, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their predators at night, they rely much more on their hearings when they are hunting for phedas rather than on their sight.
They can determine the exact position of insects and spatial objects on their way, based on their sophisticated technique of reversing ultrasound.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings across the country, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
They work with 10 skilled professionals who regularly prepare studies and sleeper studies and sometimes participate in rescue work.
The organization created the first and only dedicated dener reservation of Scotland on the Three-birds in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten bats of Scotland.
According to David Thompson, the area is an ideal habitat for bats.
“Here in Thrareve there is a great place for bats,” he said.
There are old buildings, lots of old trees, and everything else that is needed for a good living space.
But we don’t know much about bats, and thanks to the work done here and in other similar areas, we can learn more about what they need to feel great.”
He also highlighted the importance of ensuring that there are bats living there before rebuilding buildings, as the destruction of a single plant could result in the destruction of 400 women and young individuals, which can lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
Denes are protected animals, their destruction, their harassment, and their habitat are prohibited by law.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, asked for the help of the population.
He said: “We still have a lot of things we don’t know about bats, and we don’t have any information about the situation in most domestic species.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges, his lawyers are suing against the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo’s “magnificence” was a secret to the accusations of rape against him. In his opinion, others want to use his name to “be involved in public awareness”
Focist lawyers are ready to sue for a German weekly named Der Spiegel indictment.
A member of the Portuguese framework and the Battle of Juventus were accused of rapeing an American woman Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the woman, the athlete paid him $375,000 to listen to the case, wrote to Der Spiegel on Friday.
The 33-year-old Ronaldo reported in an Instagram Live video a few hours after the accusations were brought to light by 142 million fans, saying that the news was \"truth\".
“No, no, no, no, no.
What I've been caught up in today is all a lie,\" he told the camera the five-time gold ball player.
“They want to use my name to get into public knowledge.
It happens like this.
They want to become famous with my name, this is the life of public actors.
I'm a happy man, and I'm okay with my life,\" the player added in a smile.
Because of the claims that “unacceptable, private-life suspicion,” Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel, Reuters wrote.
According to Christian Schertz’s lawyer’s statement, the player will submit a claim for compensation “for the moral damage caused by the severity of the infringement, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years”
The case was reported to have occurred in June 2009 in one of the suites of Las Vegas Palms hotel and casino.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga were supposed to go up to the sports club where the man assaulted the woman anonymously, he stood in documents submitted to Clark County District Attorneys of Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo was on his knees after the incident and told him that he was a \"99% good boy\", \"one percent,\" except for one percent.
On the basis of the information contained in the documents, Ronaldo acknowledged that he had established sexual relations with the woman, but he believed that this had been done with joint consent.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police, and he also made a visit to a hospital about his injuries, but later entered into an out-of-court agreement because he “half of the retaliation” and “a manifest humiliation.”
A 34-year-old woman now wants to repeal the agreement, as the trauma caused by the case in question continues to destroy her life.
Ronaldo was just ahead of confirmation at the time of the alleged attack (from Real Madrid to Manchester United) and this summer, the giant in Italy, Juve bought the player for 100 million euros.
Brexit: The United Kingdom will forever deal with the loss of car factories
The UK will always be treated – if, after Brexit, it loses its world-leading car manufacturing position, said Mr. Greg Clark.
He added: “It is worrying” that Toyota UK has made a statement to BBC that, if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, the car factory will have to temporarily stop production in the factory near Derby in Burnaston.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
According to the Japanese car manufacturer, jobs may be lost due to the unagreed Brexit delays.
Toyota Auris and Avensis manufactured 150 000 cars last year, 90% exported to other EU Member States.
“I think that, if the UK falls out of the EU at the end of March, it will take place at the factory,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK (including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) expressed concern about the possibility that the country will leave the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, stated that after Brexit, it would close the Oxford plant of Miniket for a month.
Car manufacturers are most concerned about the risks of a non-contractual Brexit supply chain.
Toyota production line works on the basis of time, the components arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers operating in the UK and other EU Member States.
If the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU without agreement on 29 March, the cross-border disturbances may lead to production delays and lack of component parts, according to industry representatives.
Toyota said it would be impossible to store enough spare parts for more than one day in Derbyshire's plant, so it should stop production.
Clark said that Theresa May Chequers, known as the EU’s future relationship plan, “is precisely set up in such a way as to avoid delaying checks at the border.
“We need an agreement. We want an agreement under the best possible conditions to not only enjoy the fruit of our current success, but also to offer new opportunities,” BBC Radio 4 Today said.
“Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers can confirm that we need a highly successful supply chain to keep our high-level supplier chain.”
Toyota could not tell how long production would last, but warned that the cost of the plant could damage the competitiveness of the factory in the long run, which could eventually lead to the abolition of jobs.
According to Peter Tsouvalris, who has worked 24 years at the Burnaston plant and is currently working in the representative of the Unite trade union, trade union members are increasingly concerned: “In my opinion, we will never get the jobs that have ceased at this time.”
One government spokesman said: \"We have developed a new and feasible plan for future EU relations\".
You can postpone the meeting of Trump and Rosenstein again, the White House
“More than a week, you can postpone – Deputy-General Rod Rosenstein and Donald Trump’s high-ranking meeting, as the debate around the top court candidate in Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House was announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian influence on elections, the relations between Trump advisors and the Russian government, and the possible obstacles to justice by Trump.
In Washington, for months, Trump has been thinking that Trump will eventually kill the Deputy Attorney General, threatening Mueller's independence.
According to the New York Times's report, Rosenstein considered that he would come to the meeting in a wired manner to record the discussion with the President, and the question was whether Trump could be replaced by the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the speakers.
Last Monday, however, he visited the White House, and the rumor was that he was submitting his resignation.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday by the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that he would \"unwanted\" the Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed so that he wouldn't conflict with the Senate justice hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who suspected him of sexual guilt, Dr. Christine Blasay Ford, also testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, with which the final Senate vote has been postponed.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, visited Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he replied: “We don’t have a designated date yet, either this week or this week, but in the light of the cases in the Supreme Court, I see another one-week delay.
I will soon find out, and as always, I will announce the press.
However, some journalists doubted this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace also asked about this reason.
Sanders replied that the rareness of press conferences was not a reason for the behavior of television reporters – sensational behaviors – but added: “I don’t argue with the fact that it is really sensational.
He then indicated that direct meetings between Trump and the press would be held more often.
“The President has asked more questions than any previous president,” he added. Even without supporting the statement: “We have looked at the numbers.”
There will continue to be press conferences, Sanders said, but if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it is better to speak to me with light years.
We are often trying to do this, and there have been many such events in the past few weeks, so they can talk to the President of the United States in person instead of the White Home Press Conferences.
Trump regularly answers reporters’ questions when he leaves the White House or at public events, perhaps attending press conferences with the dignity he has visited.
Press conferences alone are rare.
Why, perhaps, it can be concluded from what happened this week, when the president produced a bizarre role in New York, at some point, in front of the gathered journalists.
The head of the health wallet turned to the NHS Scotland European Union staff in a letter due to concerns about Brexit.
The head of the health wallet expressed the country’s gratitude to the staff of the Scottish NHS from the countries of the European Union and stressed that he hoped that they would remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the UK’s expected exit.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the costs of EU citizens working in a decentralised public service.
In Freeman’s letter, “The negotiations on exit between the UK and the European Union continued during the summer, as a result of which a decision is expected to be taken in the autumn.
The UK government also agreed to prepare a possible scenario without agreement.
I am aware of how disturbing this may be for you.
That is why I would like to highlight once again how much I appreciate the efforts of each member of the team, regardless of the country they come from.
Employees from different EU Member States and other countries will contribute with valuable experience and expertise to the work of the health wallet, which will have a positive impact on patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we really want you to stay with us.
Christion Abercrombie was undergoing an emergency surgery after having a head injury.
The Tennessee State Tigers linebaker, Christion Abercrombie, was undergoing an emergency surgery after having suffered a head injury in the 31-27 battle against the Vanderbilt Commodores team on Saturday, Mike Organ Tennessee.
Tennessee State’s leader Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half-time.
“He walked to the beach and fell just like that,” Reed said.
The coach team and the medical staff first gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the track, then they put it on a barrel, and they took it for further investigation.
One of Tennessee State's competents in Nashville, Tennessee, said to Chris Harris, the WSMV reporter, that Abercrombie was beyond surgery performed at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that he “has no further details about the type and extent of the injury,” while Tennessee State works to determine exactly when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie spends the first season of a second-year student in Tennessee State, where she was certified from Illinois.

Foreign customers will have to pay higher tax after the property purchased in the UK
On the basis of the new Toryk plan, foreign customers will have to pay higher tax on the property purchased in the UK, and would support homeless people without additional income.
This step would neutralise Corbyn’s success among young voters
The increase in taxes is aimed at those who do not tax in the UK
According to the State Treasury estimates, this would represent an annual revenue of £120 million, which would be used to support homeless people.
Foreign customers will have to pay higher fees for the property purchased in the UK, and the additional income from it will be used to support homeless people, and Theresa May will be announced at a press conference today.
The aim of the step is probably to offset the success achieved by Jeremy Corbyn among young voters, which he achieved by making a commitment to more affordable housing and high-income measures.
The increase in taxes affects individuals and companies who do not tax in the UK, and the additional income will be used to combat homelessness.
The additional fee added to the current levy, which can be charged more than three per cent to the second apartments or to the higher fees paid to the real estate purchased for the purpose of spending.
As a result of the measure, the state Treasury will count to £ 120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built London real estates are bought by non-UK citizens, leading to a significant price increase, resulting in an increasingly difficult situation for first home buyers.
Many of the rich districts of the country have become a “spiritual city,” especially in the capital, since many foreign customers who spend much of their time outside the country.
The new bill came only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the fees that would help young people preparing to wait for their first home.
According to him, construction companies are responsible for the high maintenance of real estate prices, which have become a habit of buying and leaving areas on the parlagon. May was asked to delete the quotas for affordable houses and to begin with something about the country’s “market in shame” situation.
Corbyn has published remarkable proposals on the series of housing reforms, including housing control and the elimination of in-depth housing.
In addition, it would provide more powers and opportunities for councils to build new houses.
May said: “Tavaly said that I would like to dedicate my Prime Minister to the restoration of the English dream and to make life better for every generation.
The situation on the real estate market needs to be resolved.
Britain continues, as always, to be open to those who want to live here, work and establish a family.
However, it is not right for individuals outside the country, as well as foreign-interested companies to buy real estate as easily as those who work hard in England.
Dreams from home were almost impossible for too many people, and the unfair state of homelessness became too accessible.
Jack Ross: “I want to be the leader of the Scottish team.”
Jack Ross, the Sunderland coach’s statement that “the main desire” is to be the leader of the Scottish National Team.
The 42-year-old Scottish coach would be happy to take up the challenges of the North East club, which is currently in the third place of the first class league, leaving only three points behind in the first place.
He then transferred his headquarters to the Stadium of Light after he successfully returned his team of St. Mirren to the first-class Scottish football championship in the previous season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
Unfortunately, I was only able to get in with the reserve,” Ross said in the Scottish BBC Sports Sound.
When I was a kid, I watched a lot of the Scottish team play in Hampton with my father, and something always pulled back to them.
But now I have a chance to succeed as a club manager.
There's Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic is not excited about having to go to the printing of such great names and previously rejected the offer of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“I measure success at this moment to see if I can get the team back to first class.
If we take the structure and facilities of the club, it is definitely the place in the first-class league,” he said.
“It’s not going to be easy to get back, but it’s more than likely that I’ll only consider my activity here as a success if I succeed in getting back to the club.”
Ross's career started only three years ago, after working as an assistant coach for the Dumbarton team and spent 15 months in the Hearts training dam.
Then Aolla was helped to stand up after the team fell back to the third class, and St. Mirren, on the edge of the fall, gained the title of the championship in the next season.
Ross says he feels much more confident now than ever during his playing career, even in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren, or Hamilton Academic team.
“It was a very crucial moment,” he quoted the period spent as Alloa’s coach.
I clearly thought that management was more for me than to be a player.
That sounds weird, because I've done well, and I've had a few really memorable moments.
However, the players’ lives are sometimes very hard.
There's a lot to go through every week.
Of course, I still have to cope with the stress and pressure of the work, but management tasks lie to me.
I've always been interested in management, and now that I've tasted it, I feel the best in my skin when I'm an adult.
The entire interview will be broadcast on the Radio Scotland channel by local time from 12:00 to 13:00 on Sunday, September 30th.
According to a study, beer falls best on Saturday afternoon at 5:30 a.m.
The summer heat wave has significantly increased the traffic of heavy-duty English pubs, but there is still a lot of pressure on the restaurant chains.
Based on the data collected, the revenue of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, but the number of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, an employee of the CGA business consulting company that combines statistics, said: “As a result of the sunny period and the longer world championship than England expected, the trend of the previous month has continued in July, when the pubs experienced an increase of 2.8%, with the difference that even a further decline in restaurants could be observed.
In July, the drop in revenues in June continued to worsen.
Mainly, pubs and bars selling alcohol were the best performers who produced more growth than even in the fall in restaurants.
The pubs that offer more food were also unpleasantly affected by the long-term sunshine, although not nearly as dramatically as the operators of restaurants.
People seem to prefer drinking at this time.
The revenue from the drinks of pubs and bars operated by companies increased by 6.6% this month and the income from food fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, a freelance and hospitality RSM analyst, said: “These results follow the trend that has been drawing since the end of April.
Weather and major social and sporting events continue to be the main revenue factor in the entertainment and hospitality industry.
It is not surprising that the chain of restaurants is in a difficult situation, and the annual reduction in income of 4.8% can be particularly painful due to constant cost pressure.
It could not have been worse for long hot summer restaurants operators, and it will only be time to see whether the smaller weather in August will bring relief in this area.
The total increase in revenues for pubs and restaurants was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow pace of the introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors the sales of the UK hospitality sector (pubs, bars and restaurants) as a widely accepted industry scale, collects and analyses the performance data of a group of operators with more than 9 billion significant total turnovers of 47 members.
Five children have social media physiques that they hide from their parents.
According to a survey, five of them have a child (as long as 11 years old) with social media fiction that they hide from their parents and teachers.
According to a survey conducted by 20,000 high school students, the number of “Insta pages” is increasing.

Five children are created (at 11 years old) social media accounts that are kept from adults.
According to a survey conducted with 20,000 high school students, the number of “Insta accounts” that refer to the Instagram photo-sharing page is rapidly increasing.
As a result of the news, the fear of sharing sexual content increases.
20% of students responded to the fact that they have a macular “head” account that their parents can see, but they also create private accounts.
A mother who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter's secret side found a teenage profile on which she said, \"get raped,\"
According to research conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and independent school directors and directors, 40 percent of the 11-18-year-olds have two profiles and 50% acknowledged that they have private accounts.
“I find it worrying that so many teens feel that they need to create an online space where parents and teachers can’t reach them,” said the head of the HMC, Mike Buchanan.
Eilith Doyle will be the voice of the “sporters” – the Scottish Athletic Association
Eilith Doyle was elected as the non-executive director of the Scottish Athletic Association at the annual meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle Scotland’s most successful athlete, and Ian Beattie, chairman of the Board, said that the decision makers of sport will be invaluable for its extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Elilyth is a huge appreciation in Scotland, the UK and the international athletic community, and its presence will help the development of Scottish athletics,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I was happy to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope that I can really help the work of the Scottish sports leaders.”
The BBC regularly announced two of the four Olympic gold medals of the American athletes at the 1996 Atlantic Olympics at 200 meters and 400 meters, but was forced to a wheelchair due to a temporary brain circulation disorder.

Thank you very much for the encouraging message.
Breastfeeding Advertising that compares mothers to cows shares the online community
Heves raised an online debate with a company producing breast-feeding, which compared nursing mothers to the scalp.
According to Elvie, he developed “the world’s first silent, portable mammalian, and the appearance of their product was advertised in a musical video, ironic advertising, which showed the freedom of the device gives the mothers who are making their milk.
Four real mothers dance in a cow stand full of straw, while the lyrics of the following lines can be heard: “Yes, I know myself, I don’t have a wolf, and if I hadn’t noticed, they aren’t a giant, but my breasts.”
And the reflex sounds like, \"I'm pumping, pumping the kid up big, pumping, pumping, making out the girls.\"
The advertising published on Facebook has quickly been cross-border in online disputes.
The video reached 77,000 views and received hundreds of comments showing mixed bets. Many people say the ad is a fire from the dairy industry’s ‘borrows’.
“To promote the product with a lot of unflavoured cows.
Like us, their bodies only produce milk when they give life, but their wines are lost from them within days,\" he recalls.
Elvie breast absorber can be placed discretely in a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother )
Another comment says: “It’s terrible for the mother animal and the calf too.
But why don’t we use them to sell a mammalian to mothers who can keep their child?
Someone else added: “A full-sensory ad
Others brought me to the protection of advertising, a woman admitted that she thought the video was funny.
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would have taken it right away if I was still breastfeeding.
I felt like a cow, too.
It's a silly advertising, so I'm not trying to see it again.
The product is brilliant, he wrote.
Another comment was: “This is a funny ad at work or in a toilet for mothers who feel “mute” about it.
It does not praise or condemn the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, women show that while dancing throughout their bra was the discrete breast absorber.
The campaign is based on the feeling that women who use breast milk sometimes feel like cows.
Elvie Pump, however, does not use wires and pipes, can be discretely placed in a nursing bra, so women can move freely, hold their children or even move out during breast-feeding.
Ana Balarin, co-owner and communications director of Mother, said: “The Elvie Pump was a revolutionary product, so it had to be advertised in a bold, provocative way.
We wanted to draw attention to the challenges of the use of breasts and to the funny sense of what kind of freedom our mammalian provides in comparison to this.
Elvie's breasts didn't get into the news for the first time.
On London Fashion Week, a mother of two children, Marta Jakubowski, took off while using the product.
Hundreds of young migrants were secretly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of children in custody has been restored, while the number of monthly border crossings has not changed much. This is partly explained by the fact that the harsh rhetoric of Trump administration and its actions make it harder for them to find homes to be taken.
The hostess are typically illegal immigrants themselves, and are afraid that they will face their chances of staying in the country if they appear to receive children.
This threat increased further in June, when it was announced that parents and adults who have become a host must have fingerprinted and shared this data with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, Head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Bemigration and Customs Office), admitted in his testimony to Congress last week that dozens of people were arrested for receiving unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested were unpunished.
“80 percent of those who apply to the host and who live in a household are illegally staying in the country and a large proportion of them are convicted of crime.
That is why we continue to search for such individuals,\" Albence said.
In order to speed up the procedure for children, new rules have been introduced, according to which a part of them must appear in court within one month of being arrested, instead of 60 days before the court, social workers claim.
Many people apply through videoconference calls to the court instead of personal appearance to apply for a residence permit.
If the judge does not provide legal protection, the immigrant will be quickly expelled.
Over the past few months, social workers and workers in the system have reported that the longer detention, the more nervous and depressed children will be, and the chances of violent eruptions or escape attempts will increase.
Lawyers say that these risks are only increased by a larger facility similar to its towers, where it is more difficult to filter out those who need psychological care due to the number of children.
They added that if they don’t give children enough time to prepare or say goodbye to their friends before they are moved to such an facility, they’ll make them even more traumatized.
Syria immediately called on the American, French and Turkish “serious forces” to leave.
Minister of Foreign Affairs of Walid al-Moulalem, who spoke before the UN General Assembly, asked Syrian refugees to return to their country despite the civil war of the eighth year.
Moualem, who also served as Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign troops had entered the Syrian territory illegally, referring to the fight against terrorism, and “as will be treated with them.”
“They must withdraw unconditionally and unconditionally,” the General Assembly said.
Moualem proved that “the war against terrorism will end soon, in Syria, where more than 360,000 have died since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He declared that Damascus would continue its holy struggle to clean the entire territory of Syria, from terrorist groups and from “unlawful foreign presence”
The U.S.'s 2,000 soldiers are in Syria, most of them are trained and advised by Kurdish forces and Arab militias fighting the Bassar el-Assad.
France has sent more than 1,000 troops to the country of war.
In relation to refugees, Moualem claimed that the conditions were right for their return and that only “one Western countries” would shake “irral fears,” alarming refugees from returning home.
“We asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to help the population return,” he said.
They made a policy on a purely humanitarian question.
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide reconstruction aid to Syria until political agreement is reached between Assad and its opposition to the end of the war.
According to the UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which creates a collision zone around the last great warming of the rebels, Idlib, can facilitate further negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented the Syrian government forces supported by Russia from launching a wide-ranging attack on the three million inhabitants.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement defined the \"light deadlines\" and indicated its hope that military actions would only be directed against jihadists, including an anus-Nustra Front, which should be “examined.”
Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that a committee composed of delegates from the government and the opposition, whose task is to prepare the post-war Syrian constitution and prepare for elections.
Under Moualem conditions, the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, such as the review of certain articles of the present constitution, is deemed acceptable and prevents all external actors from being involved in the process.
That's why Trump will be re-elected
Following this logic, Trump will surely be re-elected in 2020, unless there are a number of liberal viewers’ hopes, and a liability procedure or a scandal that will not end his presidency before time.
We can be sure that this would be “the most dramatic presidencies of all time”
At the same time, the viewers enjoy the show.
Since 2014, nearly a double, 1.55 million, CNN’s main show-time view has grown to nearly triple its views, to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen's data, Fox News attracts an average of 2.4 million viewers in the main show instead of 1.7 million four years ago, while MSNBC's \"The Rachel Maddow Show\" is the most viewed cable show with its 3.5 million audience on the nights of the most significant news.
“It attracts us as a fire, because something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the leading producer of the drama series of the ABC-A designated survivor. In this series, a low-ranking miniature of the cabinet sits in the chair of the president’s chair after the death of Capitol in an attack.

Of course, in contrast to television series, stories from Washington can determine the fate of cases like Roe vs. Wade-precedents to reunite the stability of immigrant families and the global economy.
Only a very narrow layer can make sure you don't care about these facts.
However, it is no longer part of the responsible information when we have been watching a discussion show in which the credibility of the anonymous background discussions used in Bob Woodward’s book, or Paul Manafort’s 15 thousand-dollar striker jacket (as described in The Washington Post) or the implications of the description of Stormy Daniels Trump, ehm, anatomy.
As far as I'm concerned, from now on, this will always remind me of Super Mario.

Both parties pour money into the most frequent competitions of the semi-time congressional election.
No one was surprised by the fact that in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, both parties spent countless money after the rewriting of the convention districts, two active representatives were fighting for the same chair.
The recently redesigned district of Pittsburgh is one of the pre-town districts of the Democratic Conor Lamb, who received a mandate in an interim election last spring.
The Republican Keith Rothfus is currently a representative of the former 12 electoral district of Pennsylvania, which represents a significant overlap with the 17th district today.
The map had to be redefined after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania found in January that the earlier district borders were manipulated to the advantage of Republicans.
In the fight for the 17th district, the two parties’ funding bodies, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) have been almost tied to each other during the campaign.
Lamb’s name became known in Pennsylvania after winning a strong March interim election in the Congress of Pennsylvania 18 in close competition.
For more than a decade, the House of Representatives was the Republicans, Donald Trump won the district with 20 exact advantages.
Political experts say Democrats are somewhat better at winning.
The United States has considered sanctions against El Salvador for China's support and has stopped the plan.
According to the diplomats, the Dominican Republic and Panama were already on the side of Beijing, which Washington barely responded to.
In June 2017, Donald Trump spoke to Juan Carlos Varela, President of Panama, and had a hotel in Panama until his partners pushed out the Trump Organization's leadership team.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recalled US officials from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to their “consistent decision not to support Taiwan,” previously announced Heather Nauert, spokeswoman of the Ministry.
However, sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received US aid of around US$ 140 million in 2017, including the fight against drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed criminal measures, such as the reduction of financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painfully affected by the Central American country, where unemployment and death rates were also very high.
As the closed meetings continued, the North and Central American competents postponed a high-level conference on security and economic issues, which would have been a continuation of a similar meeting last year, and the primary goal was to reduce migration to the United States.
In mid-September, the high-level representatives of administration made it clear that I would like to hold the conference, which clearly indicated that they would not want to punish El Salvador.
At the conference scheduled for mid-October, Vice-President Mike Pence also spoke, which, according to diplomats, is a clear indication of how important the administration considers the event to be.
The three U.S. delegates quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, and Washington did not issue condemnations or criminal measures.
John Bolton's White House spokesman refused to comment on the details of the debate reported by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats anonymously.
Their accountants were also supported by external analysts close to the administration, who were also willing to speak anonymously.
Historical experience
The next blow, Robert Mueller, may be a report from a special prosecutor who investigates if Trump prevented the judiciary in some way.
Mueller’s investigation is also supposed to cover Trump’s team’s cooperation with Russia seeking to influence elections.
If the Democrats are most likely to be held accountable in Congress, Trump, who may face the condemnation of his fellow politicians after the voters.
We can see that there are a lot of uncertain issues, and Trump's fall is far from inevitable... as it is not a European principle.
Serious decisions must be taken on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, depending on how far the fight will go away.
In 1938, a number of German officers were ready to poke Hitler, just waiting for the West to stand next to the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
The aid has not been granted, so it has not been possible to prevent the bloodshed of the next few years.
At such historical turning points, the inevitable development of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
Today, in America, we can identify several such turning points.
What are we going to do if Trump replaces Deputy State Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in charge of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein's chair has been invading since last year, when, as our newspaper reported, he suggested to record the conversations with the president, and he added that Trump's office was inadequate.
According to Rosenstein, The Times reported the events unacquaintedly.
“How will we react if the F.B.I. investigation against Brett Kavanaugh is biased or incomplete, and despite an excellent sexual harassment accusation as a credible, will it be named as a member of the Supreme Court?
And the most important question is: are we voting in the interim elections for a Congress that is ready to take responsibility for Trump?
If we fail on these trials, democracy will be ahead of us for a long winter.
I trust it won't be like this, especially because of my experience in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew, deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, the same regime that was once located in a building serving my embassy home.
My mother survived the Holocaust, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she asked me to fire candles on the table with the sign of svosticism in the time of Sabbath.
With such a cultural heritage, how could I be pessimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans, who plays at Rangers, is confident of the Rapid Wien game
The Rangers take Rapid Wien on Thursday. The Austrian victory against the Spanish Villarreal can provide them with participation in the Group of the European League G.
Due to the knee injury of the middle-fielded Graham Dorrans, he was unable to compete in the season until the 2nd match against Villarreal, but he feels that he can also set more ambitious goals for Rangers by building this result.
“It was an important point against a great team against Villarreal,” the 31-year-old player said.
“We believed that we were able to get a point and we brought a point.
Maybe we could've pulled another goal at the end, but we can't complain about the tie.
In the first half, they were better, and we were connected to it in the second half.
Thursday will be another important European game.
I hope we get the three points, but it won't be easy, because they were pretty good at their previous match, but with our fans behind us, we'll definitely have the power to win.
Last year was hard enough, I was injured, there were many changes around the club, but now the mood is very optimistic.
It's good for our team, the kids enjoy the game, the workouts go well.
I hope that if we put everything in it, we can leave the previous season behind and achieve good results.
Many women are concerned about not saving enough for their age
The survey participants had an accurate idea of what age they wanted, but only a small part of them talked about it with their family members.
According to the Nationalwide survey, only half of respondents discussed the expected costs of their old-age care with their spouse.
Only 10% of them said they were talking to their children about it.
“Everyone wants a family member to take care of them, but they don’t usually pick up the topic,” says Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationwide Life Insurance Business.
It's worth doing the following.
First, discuss the question with your spouse and children: You cannot expect them to take care of you properly if you do not tell them in time what your needs are.
Together with your advisor and family, choose where and what kind of care you want; these decisions will have a significant impact on later costs.
Take a financial advisor: he can give useful ideas on how to pay for the planned care.
Financing can take place with a traditional insurance bond designed for old-age care or a hybrid life insurance that can cover expenses or use your own property as a cover... if you have enough resources for it.
Prepare the legal documentation: This way they will cut the possibility of future trading in advance.
Trust a representative, a trusted person who acts on your behalf on health issues, supervises your medical care and ensures that everything is done according to your expectations, even if you are unable to communicate.
Trust someone with financial management.
This trusted person makes the necessary financial decisions and arranges for the payment of invoices when you are unable to do so.
Don’t forget about the little details: Let’s assume that your older parent is in a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about your medicines and allergies?
Please record these data in writing to ensure that they are available at any time.
“It’s not just financial issues that need to be clarified, it doesn’t matter who your doctor is,” Martin added.
“What medicines are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Everything must be planned in advance.

In addition, they are accused of a class B violation, which may be a one-day closing and a fine of $2,000.
Palin does not come into contact with the law for the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, reported an alleged attack on the police.
The case is currently being discussed by the Alaskan Veterinary Court.
In January 2016, violence within the family and the prevention of criminal reporting were accused of and armed abuse under alcohol influence in the context of the case.
His girlfriend said he hit him in the face.
Sarah Palint also criticized several veterans in 2016 when she attributed her son's behavior to post-traumatic stress from the Iraqi service.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, hundreds of victims
At least 384, after a Friday earthquake, they died on the island of Celebes, Indonesia.
The 7.5-high earthquake brought up a fountain that destroyed thousands of residential buildings.
The systems responsible for electricity supply and telecommunications have become ineffective, and the number of dead will probably increase in the next few days.
The centre of the earthquake was near Central Celebes, northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
Several videos of the arrival of the fountain have appeared in social media.
On the beach of Palu, hundreds of people gathered at a feast, and then they reached the shore of the fountain.
Federal prosecutors have requested a death penalty for a New York terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are asking for a death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect of eight human lives in New York City, who has not been executed in the state since 1953.
According to a 30-year-old Saipov, in October, a truck rented from Home Depot was driven on a bicycle trip on Also-Manhattan West Side Highway, gasping many pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to prove the legality of the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov was “rightly killed” by eight victims, and that he was “made guilty of injury,” is in the prosecutor’s office in the southern district of New York.
According to the file, proof of any of the two charges may justify the death penalty.
In a few weeks after the attack, Saipov was accused of 22 crimes, including eight-and-a-half cases of blackmail, which were used almost exclusively to combat organized crime and the destruction and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack called for a substantial design and a prudent intention, according to prosecutors, and Saipov, it was carried out in a way that was “similar, cruel, inhuman.”
“Sayfullo Habibulavic Saipov has caused pain and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and the family of Alexandra Pagnucco.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
The southern district of New York recently requested a death penalty for a defendant for a decade.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but in September 2009, he was finally sentenced to life imprisonment.
In the New York Federal case, a death sentence was last executed in 1953, including Julius and Ethel Rosenberg: the marriage party was convicted two years ago for spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not show any regret in the days and months following the attack.
During the interrogations, he said he was happy to fill it.
Saipov said that the ISIS videos on his phone gave him the idea of attacking him.
Police said they were asking for an ISIS liver to be put out in his hospital room.
In all 22 charges, he declared himself innocent.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s state defenders, said that they were “obviously disappointed” because of the decision of prosecutors.
“We believe that the actual loss of life in prison for confession of conscience would have been more favourable, the death penalty will only prolong the suffering of all the actors involved in the case,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defenders had previously asked prosecutors not to claim a death penalty for their defenders.
According to a Tory representative, NIGEL FARAGE should lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage, during the Tory Conference, stated that he “calls the army of the people into combat.”
According to Ukraine's former leader, politicians need to feel the pressure of Euroscopics after a party from Theresa May said that the negotiations with the EU should be entrusted to Farage.
Peter Bone, a conservative who does not have any office, told the members of the Birmingham Assembly that the United Kingdom would have gone, if Farage were the Minister of Brexit.
It is a good character of the pressure of Mayre on a difficult party, that the Toryk of the remnant party spoke of another anti-Brexit demonstration in the city.
May is trying to implement the Chequers plan, which requires permanent shooting between Brexit and remaining parties and the EU.
His allies say that despite negative reactions, he is trying to reach an agreement with Brussels that Eurosceptics and the Labour Party can only choose between his package or the \"full chaos\".
Bone, Leave Means Leave, held in Solihull, said in protest that \"Chequers Alku\"
He proposed that Farage be brought to the House of Lords and that negotiations with Brussels be entrusted to him.
“If he were to lead the negotiations, we would have quit,” he said.
The wellingborough representative added: “I’m holding on to Brexit, but the Chequers beginning should be counted.
Criticizing the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be servants of others.
We want to bring in the laws of our own country.
Bone rejected the assumption that since the 2016 vote, the public opinion had changed: “There is no real basis for the British people to change their opinion and to remain.”
Andrea Jenkyns, the Brexit party’s Tory representative, also attended the meeting, and said to the journalists, “I just ask you, Madam Prime Minister, to listen to the people’s voice.
The Chequers coin rejects public opinion, the opposition will not vote, is unpopular of party membership, and especially among activists who work in the field and helped us get to government.
Forget the Chequers and listen to us.
He added as a sarcast addressed to May: “Only the Prime Minister can keep his seat, who keeps his word.
Farage said at the meeting that politicians must “reveal the pressure” so that they do not dare to betray the outcome of the 2016 referendum.
“The trust between us, that is, the people and our politicians, is now the bet,” he said.
“They want to sell the Brexit, and today we gathered together to tell us we don’t let them do it.”
He turned to the enthusiastic crowd with these words: “I would like to see our politicians who are preparing to betray Brexit feel the pressure.
We call the army of the people to win with Brexit and not to rest until we make the UK an independent, independent, proud country again.
The remaining parties were in Birmingham and then held a two-hour meeting in the center of the city.
Some activists formed the flag of the \"Toryk Against Brexit\" movement this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party has been living on conservatives for security errors during the opening of the conference.
“These people said they had their IT backgrounds for a Canadian-plus deal, a non-denial border crossing and a free trade deal with Ireland without borders,” he added.
- They're just talking to you.
There is simply no good Brexit, he said.
Warren - carefully consider - to start for the presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the election in November, she would consider starting for the presidency.
Boston Globe reportedly spoke about his future on Saturday at a population forum in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of Donald Trump, is preparing for a re-election in November against the Republican representative of the state, Geoff Diehl, who was the co-chair of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
For a while now, the guess is that he might be the one who could be Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke has been a meeting with voters in the framework of the 36th Population Forum since the entry of Trump.
A participant asked if he planned to go to the presidential election.
In his reply, Warren said it was time for women to play a role in the restoration of the failed government in Washington, including the takeover of the supreme position.
The person suspected of shooting Sims in LSU was arrested.
The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for shooting a basketball player, Wayde Sims, who played in LSU on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Captain announced the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson arrest at a press conference at 11 a.m. on the evening of the Eastern Party.
A video of the shooting on Friday was released earlier, and they asked for help to identify the man on the recording.
The 20-year-old Simst was near the University of Southern University near the deadly shot on Friday morning.
\"Wayde Sims suffered head injuries from the shooting that proved fatal,\" Murphy J. Paul told police chief of the media on Saturday, according to the 247sports report.
Wayde's friend got involved in protecting him, that's when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted that he was on the spot, had a gun on him, and he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson's arrest took place without incident, and the man was arrested at the East Baton Rouge police station.
In Baton Rouge, he played an adult, nearly 2 meters tall Sims 32 in the last season, played 10 as a beginner, played an average of 17.4 minutes per match, scored 5.6 points and 2.9 lepatants.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is closer to the world championship after receiving the victory before Sebastian Vettel thanks to his team ratings.
After qualifying for a better place than Lewis Hamilton on the Saturday in Valtteri Bottas, it became clear immediately that the instructions of the Mercedes team will play a big role in the race.
The unpositioned Bottas started well, and he put Hamilton in trouble, because he protected his position in the first two circles, which allowed Vettel to attack his teammate.
At first, Vettel stood in the box and let Hamilton get stuck in the traffic behind the middle field, which should have proved to be decisive.
Mercedes stood in a circle later, and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton preceded a close action, during which Ferrari's pilot left the inner arch free after twice moving as a defense in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, celebrating his 21st birthday, started from the rear row of the radial cubes, and was the seventh by the end of the first round.
He then led most of the race because he did not replace tires to quickly reach target and prevent Kimi Räikkönen in the hope of the fourth place.
Finally, he stood on the 44th round in the box, but the remaining eight round could not increase his pace, making Räikkönen the fourth place.
“It was a great day because Valtteri was doing a fantastic job all weekend, and he was a real gentleman when he was refused to let go.
The team made an exceptional effort to get the first two places,\" Hamilton said.
His body speech was very bad.
President Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a Saturday meeting, as the Senator insisted that she didn't leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter, who accused the new member of the Supreme Court of sexual harassment.
At the meeting in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to the testimony of Ford, which he did before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but only noted that things in the Senate prove that people are “infidel, hateful, and liars”
“What can happen, and the wonderful thing that took place in the Senate in the last few days, when they see the rage when they see people angry, unbelieving, hateful, and liars,” he said.
“When we look at the statements and leaks, they say, “Oh, that wasn’t me.
It wasn’t me.”
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you leaked?
Remember your answer... did you leak the document?
Oh, no.
I didn’t leak.”
Well, let's just hold on for a second.
We leaked?... no, we didn't leak,\" he added, imitating the senator.
Ford sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh to Feinstein in July, and the letter leaked out at the beginning of September. Feinstein, however, denied that the source of the leak was his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s statements, and I didn’t leak out his story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill’s report.
“He asked me to handle it confidentially and I handled it confidentially in accordance with your request.”
However, it seems that his denial was not accepted by the president, who noted at the Saturday evening meeting: “I’ll tell you what’s going on: his body speech was very bad.
It may not have leaked out, but it was the worst body talk I've ever seen.
The president continued to defend a candidate for the Supreme Court accused of sexual harassment by three women that Democrats used alleged accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take whatever means, but they regain power.
You can see vanity, hatred, they don’t care who they hurt, who they need to gas them to gain power and control,\" said Mediate.

More than eight hundred died, and many disappeared after a major earthquake struck the island of Celebes on Friday.
There are still strong post-warmages in the area and many in the city of Palu.
However, despite the escape of their colleagues, the 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly-exploited control tower at the Kohti Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport.
He remained there to ensure that the flight of the Battik Air is safe to take off at the time of the 6321.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirai said the decision saved hundreds of lives, reported the case to Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Pallo.
“Our heart has increased when we heard the news,” he added.
While authorities are concerned that the number of fatal victims can be thousands, it is difficult to approach the city of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong, according to the country’s disaster response organisation.
“The number of victims is likely to increase further, as many people are trapped under the ruins and many have failed to reach,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson.
The waves that reached the height of six meters were destroyed by Palut, where a mass funeral was held on Sunday.

The Air Niugini said a person disappeared from the lagoon in a plane accident.
According to a recent statement by a airline operating a low-cost flight in the Pacific lagoon, a man disappeared, although earlier they claimed that the evacuation of 47 passengers and crews was successful from a sinking plane.
According to Air Niugini's press release, the situation on Sunday afternoon says a man can't count on a passenger.
The airline said they're working with local authorities, hospitals, and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to further information about the passenger, such as the age and nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and personnel after the plane was hit by water when landing at the airport of Chuuk Island.
Officials reported that seven people were hospitalized on Friday.
According to the airline, six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact course of the events have not yet been clarified.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the landing track.
According to some witnesses, the plane lost the landing track.
A U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
“This is a very good thing,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes told me that, along with others, he was able to run a force in the water to the emergency exits of the flying plane.
He said the air escorts panicked and screamed, and he suffered a minor head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, ships that repaired a fleet in the vicinity were also helped in the rescue and were transported to the shore with an inflatable boat before the plane sank under the water colour 30 meters.

Analyst put together the events of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor presented the accused to the retrial of the man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, has been testifying for hours as an information analyst.
He told the jury how he put the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis together with the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said that he had received multiple phone records, according to which, on the night of his death, he was with Tellis Chambers, which contradicted the man's previous claims, reported the Clarion Legger.
When the data showed that his phone was near Chambers when the man said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford made his testimony on Saturday, during which he said he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that Tellis was lying because he was in Nashville.
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when he died.
According to mobile phone data, they only knew each other a week ago.
Rowlett reported that, after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted her text messages, calls and contacts from her phone.
\"He erased her from her life,\" Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin his closing speech on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to come to the jury later that day.

Is it a black again?
New York Dada sued a party after a \"rassist\" message
A New York Dajka filed a lawsuit against a couple of disputable dismissals, after a misappropriation in a message sent to him, the mother complained that \"there was a black one again\" was being used.
The couple deny that they are racists, and compare them to the lawsuit - blackmail.
The two-child mother, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was disappointed when, in 2016, the new child-career, Giselle Maurice, saw the woman black on the first working day of her arrival.
“NEEEEEEEE, MÁR MEGINT THE FACE,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to his husband.
But instead of her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after he woke up for his shooting, he was “unbelievingly,” sent Ms. Maurice by the sentient Plasco-Flaxman, claiming that the outgoing dajka, who was African-American, was doing a bad job, and more than expecting a philipino.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one day's work, then sent home with a Uber.
Maurice is now suing the party for the dismissal and requesting a daily $350 compensation for the six-month in-house work that was originally hired, even without a contract.
“I want to show them how to stop going, you can’t do that,” Post said on Friday, adding: “I know this is discrimination.”
The couple responded to the allegations of racism that the abolition of Maurice’s use was reasonable because they were afraid they could not trust him after it was violated.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t understand.
It's not racist.
“We are not racists,” said the husband Joel Plasco.
“But would you trust your children with someone who, even if by chance, was in trouble?
Your newborn?
Oh, come on.
According to Plasco, his wife only gave birth to the baby two months ago, and “was in a very difficult situation.”
“Can anyone attack me like this?”
It's not a good thing to do that,\" the investment banker added.
While the legal procedure is being carried out, the public opinion court quickly condemned the party in social media, in respect of their behavior and logic.
According to a level now found, the Paddington publisher was afraid that the readers would not be able to connect to a talking bear.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said: “It’s hard to imagine someone who first reads before his publication.
This information is quite fun now, when we already know how great the success of Paddington is.
His father, who worked as a BBC operator, before he felt inspiration for writing a child’s book about a little toy sticker, would not have been ashamed if his work had been rejected, and then added that the 60th anniversary of the book was bitter after his father’s death last year.
Paddington was called a very important member of his family, and added that his father was very proud of his final success.
“He was a very quiet man, he was not at all imaginative,” he said.
“But, since Paddington was almost real to him, it was like a child who took him to something: we are proud of him even if it wasn’t really our merit.
I think Paddington's success was somehow seen.
Although he created it and came out of his imagination, he always devoted himself to the merit of Paddington.”
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye to her by phone.
At the time of his arrival, his daughter was moved to Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where the doctors fought for his life in vain.
“They regularly called me to tell you she was in a very bad state, and they didn’t expect her to survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
“Then I got a call from Nad, in which he told me that my daughter would die in the next two minutes, and I had to thank him.
I said goodbye.
I said, “Tashi, I love you very much, dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors gave him to beat his heart, ran out slowly, and then left his body.
He died before, and then everything stopped.
All I had to do was sit there and wait for everything to end.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was in a place where I was surrounded by families and people.
I couldn't leave myself.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, he was already grieving for his daughter's loss, he entered the plane with the others who did not care about the trial he had just passed.
“No one knew,” he said.
“I fell on my head, and my tears were tickling all the time.
It's hard to explain, but there on the plane I felt this all-surprising compassion for them.
He needs my love and understanding.
I knew she loved my daughter very much.
Formal page with mourning women to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones because of suicide work to prevent them, and others don’t throw their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put up a card full of inspirational messages and emergency numbers on a Welsh bridge.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he became depressed and then committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parents to feel the same thing I feel every day,” he said.
The 45-year-old Ms. Davis, who lives in Lydney, told me that his son was a promising cook, and his vigyora caught on everyone.
“He knew all of his smiles.
He always said that his smile would throw up any place.
But before his death, he gave up his job because he was “in a very bad state”
Tyler, who ended his life with his own hands, was found by his 11-year-old brother.
Ms. Davis said: “I was very concerned that this would create some sort of domino effect.”
Ms. David made the cards for the purpose of “that people will find out, there are those who can be contacted and talked to, even if they are just a friend.
Don’t sit quietly – you have to talk.
Ms. Humphreys, who, for years, lost Ms. Davies' girlfriend Mark, who had been his partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of his mother.
“He didn’t say he had been depressed, depressed, or anything,” he said.
“Some days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was all under Christmas Day: When the children broke out their gifts, he didn’t look into their eyes, and they were like that.
He said that his death was a huge trauma to them, but they had to process: “He left a huge space in the family.
He broke our heart to some pieces.
But we must continue to fight.

The future of Brett Kavanaugh as the FBI starts his investigation
“I thought that if we managed to achieve what he asked for – a limited-time, limited-scale investigation – perhaps we could agree,” Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he kept the committee from falling apart, because of the party’s incoherence.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and Republican supporters oppose the FBI investigation?
Their resistance can only be attributed to timing.
The interim election is only five weeks, on 6 November, and if the Republicans are not satisfied, then it will be much harder for them to get their people to the highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators and lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and he also met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
There is a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will receive the minimum of 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow the Vice-President Mike Pence to take the decision to include Mr. Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korea's dissidents has fallen under Kim's control
The number of North Korean dissidents in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jonggun came into power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Park Bjengszok quoted the data of the Ministry of Southern Unity and said that last year it was 1127 dissidents against 2011, when this number was 2706.
Park said that the higher border guards between North Korea and China and the higher sanctions imposed on smugglers were the main reasons.
Phenjan did not comment on this information publicly.
The majority of the northern dissidents eventually receive South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the Korean war ended in 1953.
Most of them run towards China, which has the longest border to North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly protected Democratic Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
The dissidents are accepted by China as an illegal immigrant and are not a refugee and are often returned by violence.
The relationship between North and South, which is still in war, has improved significantly over the past few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Phenjan, at the heart of their discussion, were engaged in closed nuclear evacuation negotiations.
This historic meeting took place between President Donald Trump and President Kim Jonggun in Singapore, where they agreed on further cooperation on the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho blamed the US for the lack of advance.
“In the absence of confidence in the Americans, confidence in our national security is not at all, and in such circumstances it is impossible to imagine that we unilaterally take down our weapons,” Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi - hysterical – Brett Kavanaugh, said she was unfit for the Supreme Court
The president of the minority of the House, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh the Supreme Court “the hysterical” and claimed that her behavior was not in line with the work of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi spoke in an interview at the Texas Tribune festival held in Austin.
“I was afraid that if a woman behaved any time, I would call her “hysterical,” she explained Pelosi’s reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Thursday Senate Justice Committee.
Kavanaugh protested against the rumors that he was sexually harassed by Dr. Christine Blasay Ford in their teens.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes he screamed and his voice collapsed when he spoke about his family and the years he spent in high school.
In addition, he expressly condemned the Democrats of the committee, the charges against him were organised by angry liberals because of the defeat of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, according to Kavanaugh’s conduct, he proved that he was not fit for work at the Supreme Court, as he showed that he was biased against the Democrats.
“I think he excluded himself with his statements and his behavior against the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi was foamed when asked if he would try to take responsibility for Kavanaugh, in case he would fill the post and if the Democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’m saying that if you don’t tell the Congress or the FBI, it’s not just the Supreme Court, but not the court where you are right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently in a court office in the capital appeal court.
Pelosi added that he is concerned as a Democrat about the possible decisions of Kavanugh due to the Law on Payable Care or the case of Roe vs. Wade, as Kavanugh is a conservative judge.
During the hearings of Kavanaugh, he avoided the questions about whether he would change the decisions of the Supreme Court.
“There is no time for a hysterical, biased person to be among the members of the court, and he expects us to get rid of joy,” Pelosi said.
And women have to keep it in their hands.
This is a legitimate rush, months, and years of anger that has arisen on the surface, and cannot be released without crying.
“We cry when we are angry,” Ms. Steinem said 45 years later.
“I don’t think it would be so rare, do you?”
“I had a great help with a woman who worked somewhere in a leadership position,” she told me that she was crying in anger, but she developed a technique that says, when she started crying in anger, she said to her conversation partner, “You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I am angry.”
And then he kept going.
And I thought that was a great idea.
In part, tears look like a sign of anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of an early work, an office dominated by men, where I started crying in my angry inability to cry, that I caught an older woman at my neck, a cool manager, from whom I was always afraid, and he took me to the stairs.
“Let them see me cry,” he told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad, and they'll be happy because they've been upset.
Patricia Schroeder, the then Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on the presidential election campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught with a non-maritime affair on a hair called Monkey Business, he fell out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, in his deep frustration, he discovered that there was no reason why he would not go for the presidency himself.
“There wasn’t a well thought-out decision,” he told me 30 years later.
“There have been seven other candidates in the competition, and the new candidate was wanted to be in the middle of their backs.
Someone named the “Whites and the Seven dwarfs”
Since the campaign has been held for a long time, Ms. Schroeder has missed the money collection, he has accepted that he will not compete unless he picks up the $2 million.
It was a battle to lose.
He found out some of his supporters gave the men $1,000, but he only got $250.
“They thought I would get a discount,” he said.
When he held a press conference not to launch an official campaign, the emotions were so poured out because of the gratitude of the people who supported him, and the frustration and anger of sexism that he felt against the money collection and directly the voting system.
\"I had a nervous breakdown,\" said Ms. Schroeder.
“They believed that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they were going to write on my gravestone?
“Criminal”
How can the U.S. China trade war be good for Beijing?
The trade war between the United States and China was almost an earlwind, and the battle has not yet ended, according to experts, the break between countries can favour Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, fired the first warnings at the beginning of the year by imposing taxes on the most important Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant sensation this week has been, since the new duties have already affected a product worth $200 billion, practically taxing half of the goods from China to the US.
In all cases, Beijing has reduced the duty of between five and ten percent to a US product worth $60 billion.
China has accepted that it will cut back every time, and the second largest economy in the world will certainly not retreat in the near future.
If you want to get Washington to retreat, it would mean you have to give up your waist before the demands, but public bending to the US would be too embarrassing for the President of Hsi Chin-ping, China.
However, according to experts, if Beijing is doing well, the US’s trade war pressure can come well for China in the long run, as it reduces dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick decision can be made in Washington or Beijing to create conditions that could put any of the economies of the two countries into economic vortex is far more serious than previously recognised by the observers,” says Abigail Grace, a research assistant in Asia at the New American Security.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, says the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria claims that it is ready to return to the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed in the war for more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Vali Moallem said that the state’s conditions are improving.
“The current situation is more stable and safer, thanks to the results achieved in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to reinvigorate areas destroyed by terrorists, restoring normal conditions.
Now there is every condition for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, who had to flee between terrorism and self-powered economic measures that affected their daily lives and their lives.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
More than six million people in the country need humanitarian help.
Moallem said that the Syrian state would welcome all assistance to rebuild the country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional assistance or cooperation from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe has acquired the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. team at 16.5:10,5 on Le Gold National outside Paris.
The U.S. has now fallen in the European scene for the sixth time and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe defended its championship title, as the Danish team captain Thomas Bjørn reached the 14,5 points necessary to defeat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, an American star player who was struggling on the whole tournament, hit him in the water at the par-3 16th hole, giving that victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari shined among all, so he became one of the 4 players who had ever achieved the 5-0-0 results since the tournament began in its current form in 1979.
The U.S. Jordan Spieth received 5&4 from the lowest-ranking player in the European team, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, one of the best players in the world, lost 2&1, against Ian Poulter, who may have been involved in his last Ryder Cup.
The eight Ryder Cup veterans, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the best European winner of all time in the tournament with a 25.5 career point.
“I’m not crying, but I couldn’t stop today.
It was a pretty hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy to get the cup back.
It's all about the team, and I'm happy to help you,\" Garcia said.
He's going to give Jon Rahm the staphetabot who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2+1.
“I feel incredibly proud to defeat Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching this man,” said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France, and now has a career record 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistics from one of the biggest players of all time who has won 14 main titles and is only preceded by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team was struggling all weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finaut, who played excellent golf during the whole tournament.
After the disappointing result of the U.S. team captain Jim Furyk's team, he said: \"Be proud of these guys because they fought.
There was an occasion this morning when we set fire to Europe.
We fought.
Down the hat in front of Thomas.
That's great, Captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup our team, the American PGA, and our Ryder Cup committee to move forward.
I love this 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You also have to lift your hats.
The opponent was better than us.
