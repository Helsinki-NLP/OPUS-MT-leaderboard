Members of Wales are afraid to look stupid.
Some members of the House are confused with the proposal that their title should be replaced by MWP, a member of the Welsh Parliament in Wales (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
Kohu started with a plan to change the name of the delegation to the Parliament of Wales.
Regardless of the party, members of the parliament are concerned that the change can make them a fool.
According to a Labour Party representative, the group is concerned about the fact that the name \"stripping\" with the words \"Twp\" and \"Pwp\"
For readers outside Wales: in Wales, twp means stupid and pwp means kakka.
According to one of the representatives of the Plaid Party, the majority of the group is not satisfied and has proposed other options.
According to the representative of the Conservative Party, his group regards the change of name, with the most open mind, but notes that the MWP word is a short word for a stupid word.
In this context, the W-book in Wales is written in the same way as the York English U-book.
The representative body currently preparing the legislative amendment necessary for the change of name said: \"The final decision on the appointments of members of the representative body is of course for the members themselves,\" he said.
The Wales Administration Act for 2017 gives the delegation the power to amend its name.
In June, the Commission published an opinion poll on the proposals that the appointment of a representative body as a Welsh Parliament will enjoy broad support.
The Commission favours the members of the Assembly as the title of the members of the Wales Parliament or the abbreviation of the WMP, but the MWP option received the most support in the public opinion poll.
Members of the Parliament appear to propose alternative titles, but the lack of consensus can cause the main concern to President Elin Jones, who is expected to have a legislative proposal for changes within a few weeks.
The legislation on amendments includes other changes to the functioning of the representative body, such as rules on the abolition of the representative act and the format of the committee system.
In the legislative process, the members of the representative body may cast their final vote on the name on which they should be invited.
The Macedonians will go to the elections during the referendum on the amendment of the country's name.
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether the country's name will be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum aims to resolve the dispute that lasted decades with the neighbouring country of Greece, which also has its own state called Macedonia.
Athens has long repeated that the name of the Northern Neighbor is in practice a territorial requirement for its territory and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO membership efforts.
The President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the referendum, has said he should ignore the vote.
However, the supporters of a referendum such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev are concerned that the name change is simply a price for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martins watches will be quiet when the churches of Harlem live in difficult times.
“The elderly people I’ve discussed with say that before every street corner there was a bar or church,” Adams said.
“There is no such thing as either...
He said that the loss of bars is understandable.
He said, “The people’s relationship has changed.
“The Bars are no longer the common living rooms of the neighborhood, where people gather regularly.
In the case of churches, he is concerned that the sale of property does not go as far as the managers imagine, and sooner or later they have returned to the starting box.
He added that churches can be replaced by housing houses and apartments that the living people do not support the remaining saints of the neighborhood.
“For more people who buy apartments from these buildings will be white,” he says, “and thus they will be forced to close their doors permanently, because it is unlikely that most of the people who are moving to these rooms will become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by the white churches before Harlem became a black residential area - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins later.
The original White Methodist Church moved out in the 1930s.
The nearby church of black people acquired the property of the building.
St. Martins took over the Black Church under the leadership of pastor John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott against the merchants of 125th Street on the main trading street of Harlem, against the hiring or promotion of these opposed black people.
In 1939, the fire was badly damaged by the building, and when Father Johnson’s church plan was rebuilt, they introduced the tower clock.
Pastor David Johnson, father of Johnson's son and successor in St. Martins, proudly called the tower bell to be the bell clocks of the zodiac.
In July, an expert called the tower clock game called it the second name: “Culture Art and Unreplaced Historical Instrument”
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first black-skinned music tower bell game, which was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to play a bigger tower-rolling game in Riverside 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martins didn't replace him.
In recent months, St. Martins has developed a complex vacuum involving architects and contractors hired by the church’s landscape managers and the episcopal hippie.
In July, the Saccas - the governing body of the church’s landscape leaders - wrote to the skier its free worry about the fact that the hippies tried to attract the cost to the drawer, even though the drawer had not been involved in the remuneration of architects and contractors sent by the ski department.
Some of the churches complained about lack of transparency in the case of the hippopotamus.
The shark damaged a 13-year-old hummer in California
The authorities say the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and damaged him when he dived a boy on the opening day of the humming season in California.
The attack occurred at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before the 7th morning.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB-TV that he had been diving with his friends on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard the boy screaming help.
Hammel first told me that he was just excited to catch a hummer, but then he realized that he screamed, \"I was bitten.\"
I was bitten!”
After getting to the boy, Hammel says he noticed that this whole cellulite had been torn open.
“I heard everyone leave the water: in the water there is a shark – Hammel added.
The boy was flown to a children's hospital in San Diego, where his condition was said to be critical.
The species of shark attacked is not known.
In a media event, Captain Larry Giles said that a shark had been observed in the area for a few weeks earlier, but it was found to be a non-hazardous species.
Giles added that the victim had suffered serious injuries to his upper arm.
The authorities closed the beaches from Casabladin Ponto Beach to Ecinitas Swam for 48 hours for research and safety reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's is going to the United Kingdom's beauty salon
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrugin and Debenhams in department-style beauty care that serves expert advice.
This is a major movement for a beauty salon worth £2.8 billion in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow, although the sales of fashion and household supplies are deteriorating. The larger beauty care departments are being tried in 11 stores across the country and are extended to other stores next year.
The beauty care products are placed because supermarkets strive to fill the shelf space that was previously reserved for television, microwaves, and household supplies.
Sainsbury's says its beauty-care range is doubled into 3,000 products, which include the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweeterman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space, and they get their own brand-specific areas like Boots stores.
Supermarket is also re-enacting their Boutique makeup selection. In the future, the majority of products will be vegan friendly, as young shoppers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop is testing rental shops in two Sainsbury's stores. The first was opened last week at Croydon South London, and the second will be opened to Shelly Oak later this year in Birmingham.
Internet purchases and the transfer of food to small single purchases in nearby shops will force supermarkets to find new appeals for customers.
CEO of Sainsbury's Mike Coupe has said that stores will look even more like supermarkets when the supermarket chain struggles against low-cost stores like Aldin and Lidl by increasing services and non-food products.
After buying both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores in its stores, and also the Habitat movements. The company tells us about the sale of food and the cost of making it profitable.
Supermarket failed in its previous attempt to renew its beauty care and pharmacy departments.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation ended up arguing about how the revenues of supermarkets should be shared.
The new strategy follows a company trade in which Sainsbury's sold 281 of its sales pharmacy business to Lloyds Pharmacy with 125 million pounds three years ago.
The company told Lloyds that he was part of a plan to expand into four stores with a selection of luxurious skin care products like La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have changed the appearance and mood of our beauty care departments to improve customer experience.
We have also invested in skilled workers who are willing to advise customers.
Our brand range responds to all our needs and attractive environments as well as our convenient location makes us a convincing beauty shop destination that challenges the traditional way to make purchases.
Peter Jones - after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from a £11 million deal
The Dragons Den star Peter Jones left in his rage when the TV driver Holly Willoughby withdrew 11 million pounds of contract with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home food and costume brand Truly.
The two companies are compared to the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand.
The 37-year-old manager of this Morning program announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered the Dragons Den star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their profitable lifestyle business at the last minute. He is now focusing on his new giant deal with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The departures tell us that Jones was in his rage – last Tuesday in a tight-seated meeting that was held at Jones's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinhamshir. The star girl in the TV had admitted that her new $1.5 million contract would not leave enough time for their home food and apartment brand Truly.
The company has been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand, and it has been resembling Willoughby's estimated worth of £11 million.
The 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he left Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his vacation homes.
According to one source: “Truly was the most important project for Holly.
It was his long-term plan to ensure his livelihood for the next two decades.
His initial decision has left everything in the power of surprise.
No one believed the events on Tuesday so close to the publication.
Marlow's headquarters has a warehouse full of products waiting for sale.
This Morning is one of the UK’s most secure stars, and according to experts, his departure can cause the company millions of losses due to product placements that include all pillows for candles and clothing for household supplies, not to mention the delay of publication.
It can mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby, and his wife, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby organized Cappin Truly in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones became president in March.
Couples travel together and Jones owns 40% of the Baldwin TV production company.
Willoughby will be baked from the new M&S brand Ambassador and replaced by Ant McPartlin as the plot of the I'm A Celebrity program.
The source close to Jones said last night, “We don’t comment on his business.”
Hard talk and then we fell in love
He joked on the criticism that would be received in the media about his comments, which some would consider inappropriate to the President, and his positive attitude towards North Korea's leader.
Why has President Trump given so much?
Trump said he pretended to be a \"new anchor\" voice.
I didn't give up any...
He pointed out that Kim was interested in meeting again after Trump’s first meeting in July as a major step towards the nuclear arsenal of North Korea.
However, the nuclear negotiations have been cut.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in July, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world’s leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the Nordics did not see a reaction from the United States – to the early armed activities of North Korea.
Instead, he stated that the United States will continue to impose sanctions that are intended to keep pressure on them.
Trump had a much more optimistic view in his speech.
\"With North Korea, it's going to be great,\" he said.
“We were in a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have such an excellent relationship.
According to him, efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results. The missile tests have been discontinued, hostages have been helped with freedom and the remains of American soldiers have been returned home.
He also defended his unusual style when talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be Presidential, but instead of trying to get out of this spot, we’d have about 200 people standing right there,\" Trump said.
Indonesian tsunami and quake destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
As an example, in the latter ads of the Lombok earthquake, a number of foreign voluntary organizations were told that they were not needed.
The state of national emergency required for international assistance was not declared, although around 10% of the inhabitants of Lombok had remained homeless.
“In many cases, they have unfortunately made it very clear that they do not seek international assistance, so the situation is a little challenging,” Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children form a group that travels to Paluu, it is not certain whether foreign staff can work in the field.
Sutopo, the National Disaster Agency’s spokesman, said Indonesian authorities would assess the situation, so as to see whether international organisations would be allowed to participate in the assistance work.
Indonesia is still unprepared to face natural forces, taking into account frequent earthquakes.
Although Acehi has been built on tsunami protection, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The fire was likely lost due to the missing tsunami alerts, even though the warning was in effect.
Travelling between the numerous islands of Indonesia is challenging even under the best conditions.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
The hospital ship assigned to help the victims of the Lomboki earthquake is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before it reaches a new accident area.
President Joko Widodo made the progress of Indonesia's past infrastructure at the centre of his election campaign, and he has donated money to improve roads and railways.
However, some of the governments have been struggling with financial deficits, while new elections are approaching next year.
Some pressures also increase the tension between religious groups in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority of the country has adopted a more ancient form of religion.
Christians and Muslim gangs have fought street fighting with jungle knives, bows and arrows, as well as other alkeal weapons. This has led to the death of more than 1,000 people and tens of thousands have had to leave their homes.
See: Daniel Sturridge in Liverpool sank a late strike against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool's loss on Saturday after painting at 89 minutes in Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received an entry from Xherdan Shaqir 27 from Chelsea's goal when his team was in a defeat position.
He moved the ball to the left before he dreaded the shot towards the back door.
The shooting cut high above the penalty area towards the right upper corner.
In the end, the ball fell over Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to make myself play to get players like the ball and Shaq always play up as much as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time as possible for myself,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching, I took one touch and shot without thinking too much.
Chelsea led the match in half time between 1-0 Belgian Eden Hazard painted on 25 minutes.
The Blues bear gave Mateo Kovacic a heel before he wheeled off the middle of the middle field and sprang to Liverpool's field side.
Kovacic played a fast wall feed in the middle of the field.
Then he released the Hazard Penitentiary with a great passover.
Hadard escaped the defense and passed Liverpool with the shot of Alisson Becker's left foot to the back corner.
Liverpool meets the master's league on Wednesday at 15 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will meet at the UEFA European League of Videoton on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of deaths of the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832 deaths
The Indonesian disaster agency said early on Sunday, the number of earthquakes and tsunami deaths had risen to 832 victims.
At the press conference, the Agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo said that many had been trapped in the ruins of the collapsed buildings when the earthquake struck 7.5 magnitudes on Friday and raised up up to six metres of high waves.
The fragmented buildings spread widely to 380 000 inhabitants in the city of Please.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after finding a woman stabbed to death
A woman's body found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning began a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7.55 at Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
The police ask the persons in the area to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Commissioner Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is in its initials, but I appeal to all those in the neighborhood of John Street to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also appeal to all taxi drivers who may have recorded something for the dashboard video to contact the police.
The police officer has confirmed that the woman found dead is from Birkenhead, and that the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, the crime scene has become perhaps known to a woman who has asked her where she was found.
As the investigation continues, the police say they are trying to inform the victim of the close events.
The taxi driver at the Grayson Mews was just trying to get back to his apartment, but the police had told him that no one would let anyone out of the building inside or out.
He was in word when he found out what had happened.
The residents have just learned that they can go for hours before they are allowed back in.
A police officer was told that the entire area is currently treated as a crime scene.
There was a tearing woman at the scene.
He repeated his repeat that it was terrible.
In the two afternoon isolated area there were two Mays, and outside the third.
There were several police officers in the isolated area who controlled the apartment.
All people who know something are asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or to call anonymous Crimestoppers with 0800 555 111 using the recognition of 247 on 30 September.
Parliament's Cromwell Patsaski became part of the history rewriting journal
The espionage of the statue would be a poetic right, given that his own fanatical puritanists destroyed the cultural and religious monuments of England as well as the best Taliban.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as a \"type-to-type\" and \"rewriting\" of history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the ongoing debate on the removal of statues would be a goalboard for Oliver Cromwell’s statue in front of the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not command or execute iconos of the British Civil War.
The wrong Cromwell might have to suffer from the actions of his ancestors Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's great description of Cromwell's opinion in the 19th century is historical proof of the character that many still consider worthy of praise.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Many, although perhaps more than in the 19th century than today, will hold Cromwell as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, which, of course, was caused by monarchy in this case.
Whether this is an exact description of the subject is a subject of constant historical debate.
There is a certainty at least that the mid-19th century dispute has shaped our nation’s later development, while Cromwell has to be identified as a figure representing the other half of that division.
In addition, his achievements as a state minister deserve to be praised and remembered.
Killer's dick broke out of Chinese farmer's life
Local media say the pig attacked the farmer and killed it in a tower in Southeast China.
Only the body of a man identified as ‘Yua’ was found near Liupanshui Square in Guizhou Province. The man’s artery had broken down and he was in the blood, the South China Morning Post newspaper announced on Sunday.
The pig is preparing to vaccinate pigs in Qinghai Province in China on May 30, 2005.
He was reported to travel with his cousin from the nearby Yuna County on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the tower.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also saw the door to the nearby pig being open.
In Sikala, he said he saw a big scream, whose mouth was in the blood.
According to the news, a criminal investigation confirmed a 250-pound gravel of the farmer's life.
Guiyang Evening News says “My cousin Wu” told me that my cousin’s feet were bloody and bruised.
The camera image shows the cousin arriving at the tower to feed pigs on Thursday morning at 4.40 p.m.
His body was found about an hour later.
The man who killed the pig didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the tower's leaders told Evening News that the pig was locked behind the locks, so that it would not harm other police officers when collecting evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and government officials are told about the compensation for the death penalty.
Pigs are known to attack people before, even though it is rare.
In 2016, the pig attacked the woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts.
Ten years ago, a nearly 300-pound pig climbed the Welsh farmer against this tractor until his wife managed to alarm the animal.
After eating pigs in Oregon in 2012, the farmer in Manitoba told the CBC News channel that although pigs are not usually aggressive, the taste of the blood can act as an trigger.
They're just playful.
They're like little kids, very curious, and they're not meant to hurt.
All we have to do is respect them properly, he said.
The remnants of the Hurricane Rosa bring heavy rains to the Southwest US
Hurricane Rosa is expected to decline by moving over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the next few days, however, Rosa will bring floods to North Mexico and the Southwest US.
Rosa’s wind speed was 38 meters per second, i.e. the first-class hurricane, on Sunday morning from the east coast, and it was 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, there is a low pressure on the Pacific Sea that is heading east towards the western coast of the United States. When Rosa arrives in California on Monday as a tropical storm, it starts to push deep tropical humidity north towards the southeastern parts of the United States.
Rosa brings up to 250 mm of rain to some parts of Mexico on Monday.
After that, the tropical humidity that interacts with the approaching low pressure will form large rainy areas for lunch in the next few days.
Local rainfalls of 25 to 100 millimeters cause dangerous heavy rainfalls and possibly earthquakes in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes rainfalls of 50 to 75 millimeters per hour in certain landing areas, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
For certain areas in lunch, and in particular Arizona, it is expected to produce up to 50-100 millimeters of rain.
Hard rains are possible and conditions can quickly be reduced due to the fragmentation of tropical rain.
In the event of a tropical rain, it is strongly recommended to avoid leaving the wilderness.
Hard rains can turn canyons into low-flowing rivers and thunderstorms can produce local windfalls and flying dust.
The approaching low pressure area brings local hardships to the coastal areas of Southern California.
More than 10 mm of rainfall is possible, causing small waste streams and sliding roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the area.
The scattered tropical rainfalls begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday until the rains expand on Monday and Tuesday.
The rainfall spreads to Four Corners on Tuesday and lasts throughout the middle week.
In October, the United States can see intense fluctuations in thermal temperatures when the Arctic region is cooled, but even if the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes causes high temperature swings at short distances.
In the middle of the United States, an excellent example of great temperature differences is seen on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha and Nebraska, St. Louis and Iowa Des Moines.
The summer-long heat is again trying to strengthen and expand in the next few days.
The beginning of October is widely expected to be warm in the central and eastern parts of the United States, with a temperature of +26 degrees from the south plains to the north.
In New York, the temperature can be reduced to +26 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 4 degrees warmer than average.
According to our long-term forecast, the eastern parts of the United States have good potential for higher temperatures in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people looked at Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million watched a broadcast on Tuesday by six television channels, where the Supreme Court Attorney-General Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual offences in the 1980s, gave their fascinating testimony.
At the same time, the political Patti situation continued as the television companies discontinued their broadcasts at the latest moment, according to which the FBI carried out a week-long investigation of the charges on the basis of a contract concluded by Senator Jeff Flake.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was suffocated with him and tried to remove his clothes in high school.
Kavanaugh, on the other hand, gave an emotional testimony, saying he was 100% sure that this was not the case.
The viewers were probably more than 20.4 million reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company calculated the average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
The figures of other channels, such as PBS, C-Span and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulties measuring viewers who look at the offices.
Something in terms of scale tells us that the reading corresponds to the number of American football dropouts or Oscars.
According to Nielsen, the largest number of viewers from all television companies was Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have strongly supported the name Kavanaugh. The channel had an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-to-day consultation.
The ABC was second with 3,26 million of its viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million, 2.44 million NBC, 89 million MSNBC and 2.52 million viewers.
After consultation, interest was still high.
In the middle of the drama on Friday was Flake.
CNN and CBS's cameras described how protesters screamed him on his way to the hearing of the Judiciary Committee on Friday. The Maltese Republican background forces had previously announced him voting for Kavanaugh.
CNN looked straight at how he stood at a minute's store looking down at the noises flying.
\"Sison directly in front of you,\" a woman said.
Do you believe he will tell the truth to the people?
\"You have power when so many women are powerless,\" he was told.
Flake said that his office had issued an opinion and added that before the elevator doors were closed, he would have more to say after consultation of the committee.
Several hours later, cable and broadcasting networks were sent directly when the Committee on Legal Affairs began to vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh at the Senate plenary session.
However, Flake only said in the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate in the coming week, as the minority Democrats have called for.
Flake was convinced by his friend, Democrat Chris Coons, on the basis of his discussions.
Flake made his decision after discussing with Coons and several other senators.
Flake's choice was in power because it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to accept Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses Critics of Brexit Politicism
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses, in an interview with the Sunday Times, the people criticising his EU-differentiating plans for politics that threaten Britain’s future and national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham in Britain on 29 September 2018.
Next to May’s interview, another interview was published on the front page of the newspaper, where his former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued to attack May’s so-called Chequers plan. Johnson calls for a proposal that the UK and the EU would subject each other’s import duties.
Wayde Sims' shooting: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson's suspect of the death of the LSU player
Police have arrested a person in LSU for shooting the 20-year-old Wayde Sims' death.
A 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and sent to prison, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department, he is accused of murdering second-degrees.
The authorities released a video of the interdependence between Sims and Simpson, where the police say Sims lost his glasses.
Police found glasses at the scene and told us that they found Simpson's DNA, says WAFB.
Police say Simpson admitted to shooting Wayden in interrogations.
According to the Advocate magazine, his guarantee amount was set at $350,000.
On Friday, East Baton Rouge's county death researcher released a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a shot at the neck.
The agency would like to thank the Louisiana State Police Police Force, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police Police and the local residents for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, the LSU’s movement leader, thanked law enforcement authorities for their awareness and justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-metre attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his Wayne father played basketball at LSU.
He recorded an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 in the game last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that he was “suffered and shocked” about Wayden’s death.
\"You're always afraid of something like this,\" Wayde said.
The volcano spits ashes on Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl mountain has reached the southern residential areas of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, Mexico’s disaster prevention centre urged citizens to stay away from the volcano when the crater’s operations accelerated and, during the day, there were 183 gas and ash eruptions registered.
The centre registers the jymina and vibrations several times.
In the social media, images were published in areas such as Mexico City Xochimilco, where car windshields were covered with a thin layer of ash.
Geophysians have discovered 72 kilometres of the capital since the earthquake of 7.1 magnitude in September 2017.
“The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police and catalysts will bring together before the anniversary of the independence vote.
In Barcelona, six people were arrested on Saturday in the assembly of protesters and riot police who supported independence. Thousands participated in competing demonstrations on the first anniversary of the dissident vote.
The police arrested a group of masked independence supporters who threw the police on the mud and powder paint, which formed dark dust clouds on the streets normally filled by tourists.
During the day, more cannons broke out when the police used their guns to curb the downfalls.
The associations between the supporters of independence and the groups of the Unionists continued for several hours, when the former shouted “no forgetting, no forgiveness, and the latter “live Spain”
The local press reports that fourteen people have received treatment for minor injuries in protests.
The excitement is still on the ground in an area of independence after a year of the 1st October referendum declared illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by the Catalan parasitics.
The voters chose independence by a clear majority, although participation was low in the opposition boycott.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in the last year's violent coup, when the police tried to prevent voting in polls across the region.
The groups that supported independence stayed outside on Friday in order to prevent a protest that supported the national police.
However, the demonstration was organised, but it had to go on another route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electric man who attended the separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful about Catalonia's independence.
“Last year we experienced one of the best moments of our lives.
I see my parents crying for joy when they can vote, but now we're stuck in places,\" he says.
Despite the huge victory achieved in the regional elections last December, the pace of the parties supporting Catalonia's independence has shrunk this year. Many of the most well-known leaders are in voluntary exile or arrested waiting for a trial of their participation in the referendum and the declaration of independence following it.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, pictured a police protest on his phone, says politicians on both sides of the fire.
\"Your face is tightening all the time,\" he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine members of the Dutch leaders who were in custody until last year, announced that he would participate in the next year's European elections.
“It is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and the oppression we have seen by the Spanish government.

Livingston won Rangers 1-0 in Menga
Dolly Menga's first score in Livingston guaranteed victory
A serialist, Livingston evaporated Rangers and caused Steven Gerrard only the second loss in 18 matches as a manager of the Ibrox club.
In the end, Dolly Menga's goal was enough to win as Gary Holt's team got into a split second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's crew remained without the first win of the season in Premiership. Next, it will meet next Sunday with the serial director Hearts, eight points ahead.
The Rangers will meet in the Rapid Vienna European League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, continued to be a lossless pipe in the series for six matches, and Chief Coach Holt has not yet lost once since he replaced Kenny Miler in the last month.
Livingston wasted places on a visitor suffering from a lack of steel
The Holt team should have been leading long before its goal, having caused the Rangers to face the worst difficulties with their gender.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finishing went wide. The next thing you know, Alan Lithgow was able to slide on the groundline to Craig Halket's sweater, but he was driving the ball over.
The hostess preferred to hand over the ball management to Rangers because they knew they could vaccinate special situations.
This is exactly how an important goal came.
Rangers gave Livingston a free kick, from which Declan Gallagher and Robinson played a place for Menga to move the ball to the middle of the penalty zone and finish.
The Rangers had kept the ball by then, but stated the defense of the home team, and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely able to try.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to fight.
Rangers' goalkeeper Allan McGregor prevented Scott Pittman's company and Lithgow led the ball past one of the special events of Livingston.
Livingston's penalty area was constantly cleaned up with rainy centers. In addition, two situations required an unnecessary penalty kick - Halket's hacked exchanger Glenn Middleton and the hand hit ball.
Great performance from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Alaskar Lamont Tony Macron
Great performance and result from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and was excellent for every player, continuing to rise through leadership.
The team's play and crew haven't changed much since it got back to the highest serial level.However, the Dutch must be recognized for the way in which he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great in leading an excellently organized defense, while Menga holds Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall toes the whole match.
But there were no ideas from Rangers.
The team has occasionally appeared very well under Gerrard, but was now far from his requirements.
The last feed was exhausted, and they managed to open the defense of the home team only once. This should act as a wake-up to Rangers, which is the middle cup of the series table.
Erdogan received a variety of receptions in Cologne
Smile was delicate and sky blue on Saturday (29 September), when Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, the purpose of the trip is to improve relations between NATO's allies.
There have been differences between human rights and freedom of the press and the EU's efforts in Turkey.
Erdoga continued his journey to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The largest Turkish population in the city is outside Turkey.
The police prevented a 25 000-year-old support team from meeting in front of the mosque, justifying the matter for security reasons, but still a lot of supporters were gathered near to see the president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom were Kurds, also brought their voices to the people, condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the decision of the German government to invite him to the country.
The competing demonstrations reflect the distribution of opinions, and some of the German Turks greet him as a hero as a hero in the arms of others as a self-confidence.

Hurricane Rosa brings the threat to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (dry areas can benefit)
There is rarely a tropical low pressure in Arizona, but this is exactly what happens at the beginning of next week, when the remnants of Hurrikani Rosa move over the southeastern desert, bringing the risk of heavy rainfalls.
The National Weather Service has already given warning of the harsh floods on Monday and Tuesday from West Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, south-eastern California and Utah, as well as the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosan is expected to go straight over Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving in the form of rainfalls on Monday.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix pointed out in its tweet that only ten tropical storms have kept the state of tropical storm or low pressure within 300 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane at a distance of 65 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre predict the rainfalls of 50-100 millimeters. With the Mogolin brush in Arizona, up to 150 millimeters can be found.
In other southeastern regions, including the central rock mountains and the Great Basin, 25-50 millilitres can be verified. A total of up to 100 millimeters can be used at some point.
Rosa’s rains can also be a blessing by trying drought in the area, if there is no danger of heavy rains.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some of the rains can be useful because of severe drought in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Dryness Agency, more than 40% of Arizona suffers from extreme drought, which is the second highest class, says Weather.com.
The Hurricane Rosa first makes the trip to California in Mexico.
Sunday morning Rosa location is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. At the time, it is still a hurricane with a strong wind speed of 135 km per hour. It moves north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm loses its power when it encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Sea.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico during a tropical storm during Monday or evening.
In some of the Mexican rains can be severe and cause a significant flood risk.
“California’s peninsula is expected to be 75-150 millimeters, and up to 250 millimeters are possible,” says Weather.com.
Rosa will then continue her journey through Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border as a tropical low pressure on Tuesday in the morning hours. From there it will continue its journey through Arizona to the south of Utah on Tuesday by late.
“The biggest risks of Rio or its remains are linked to very severe rains in California’s Peninsula, Northwest Sonora and the Southwest United States,” states the National Hurricane Agency.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening heavy rainfalls and waste streams in the deserts, as well as earthquakes in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton's attack: Four Arrested Killers
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday morning in Britain.
He was taken to a hospital in which he was reported to be in a \"serious\" state.
Police say they have arrested one 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset during the night.

Trump says Kavanaugh's experienced democratic party is an atrocities and anger.
“The voice on behalf of the judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the unspeakable and disgraceful methods of the democratic party,” Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was suffering from a democratic party's ailment and anger -- all the time in his appointment process.

“The voice for strengthening the name of the voice judge Kavanaugh is a voice for one of the most prestigious legal students of our time with excellent seams for public service,” he told West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh when speaking about the importance of Republican voting activity in the interim elections.
“We are five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
Not just a campaign, but a campaign, he said.
For this reason, I will be recycled everywhere to fight for excellent candidates.
Trump claimed that the Democrats had taken up the task of resisting and preventing the opposition.
The senior assistant to the Republican party management told CNN that the first important vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh was expected by the Senate on Friday.
Hundreds of dead in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunamis, the number of deaths expected to rise
On Saturday, at least 384 dead earthquakes and tsunamis were reported by the authorities on the island of Sulawes in Indonesia.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered on the city’s beach, when the waves of up to six meters hit the beach in the evening storm. Many were flushed to death when the waves were destroyed from all roads.
Tsunamin caused 7.5 magnits of strong earthquakes.
When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still floating on the beach and did not leave immediately when they were victims of it,\" said the Indonesian High Accident Relief Agency (BNPB) at Purwo Nugroho Jakarta.
\"Tsunami didn't come alone, but it pulled cars, tree bodies, houses and hit all over the country,\" Nugroho said.
Some people survived the tsunami by climbing to trees, he says.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Pala.
The air images published by the Disaster Agency show several destroyed houses and shops, stretched and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Afterquakes continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes seemed to be in the area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Office BPPT issued an opinion that the energy released in the Friday’s vast earthquake was responsible for approximately 200 atomic bombs that were dropped in the Second World War of Hiroshima.
It says that the terrain of a city in a long and narrow bay may have shone tsunamis.
Nugroho described destruction as a widespread one, and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels had collapsed.
He reported the ruins of some of the damaged buildings found in the bodies of the victims and added that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that death victims and that the damage could be greater from Pala to the north on the continuous coast of Donggala, which is closer to the centre of the quake.
The communications connections are completely out of line, and there is no information about Donggala,\" Nugroho says.
According to a statement by the Red Cross, there are over 300,000 people living there, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
\"This is a tragedy, but it can get even worse,\" he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not telling the tsunami hit Palu. However, the authorities said that the waves had arrived during the warning.
The man in the top floors of the building in a social media video shouts strongly for the warning of approaching tsunamis for people on the street.
Only minutes later, the beach will be hit by a water wall that will take you to buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately verify the trueness of the image material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a large electric shock, which cut off communications connections around Please. This hampered the coordination of rescue measures by the authorities.
The authorities tell you that the army has begun to send help from Jakarta and other cities to transporting machines, but the evacuated ones still desperately need food and other basic supplies.
The city airport has been re-opened for assistance only and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodon was to visit the evacuation centers on Sunday.
The Indonesian tsunami's number exceeds 800.
The situation is really bad.
The staff of the World Vision Donggala have reached a safe place in the city where they have been housed in the courtyard of the office. On their journey they bypassed the scene of destruction, says Doseba.
\"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,\" he said.
The situation is really bad.
Upon the initiation of his irrelent mission, some complained that foreign aid workers were prevented from travelling to Paluu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, equipment and staff from abroad can only begin to flow once the accident area has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not happened yet.
“There is still a disaster at the county level,” says Aulia Arrani, the spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
\"When the government says that \"OK, this is a national disaster, we can start receiving international assistance, but the declaration has not yet been made.
When the second night landed on Please after a Friday earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members in the lost were hoping that their loved ones would deviate from the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the bathroom.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been in ruins for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, a Indonesian addictive coach, had trained two missing addicts for Asian races that ended earlier this month.
The Roa Roa hotel was also trapped by his students, says Mandagi.
“As an older member of the college, I have my own emotional burden,” he says.
Gendon says that he was desperately trying to reach those who participated in the beach festival Please competitors in WhatsApp visits after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel spread among the alliance community.
However, only one grey sign appeared after the messages he sent instead of two blues.
“It means that no messages were sent,” he said.

Kanye West: Puppet to change the name Ye
The Dirty Kanye West will change its name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: \"The character that was previously known as Kanye West \"
Ye has been a 41-year-old West nickname for some time, and he also used it as the name of his eighth album published in June.
The change precedes his future performance in the Saturday Night Live program, where he is expected to publish a new album called Yandex.
He replaces the program singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the author of the program, canceled his participation for reasons of emotion.
West has previously said that the word has a religious significance for him, in addition to being short of his professional name.
Speaking of the name of the album earlier this year with the radio driver Big Boy, West said, “I believe that “ye” is the most common word of the Bible, and it’s important there.
“I am you, us, and all of us.
It started with Kanya, which means the only one, and ended up in the shortest form of Ye - which merely expresses the goodness, evil, confusion, everything in us.
The album is mainly a reflection of who we are.
He is one of several known rappers that have changed their name.
Sean Combs is often known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he said he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former partner in West, has also removed and restored the United States and the big letters.
Mexico's AMLO promise not to use an army against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected president of Mexico, promised never to use military force against civilians.
At Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised that “somebody would not use an army for the repression of the Mexican people.”
The armed forces fired a peaceful protest on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people during the time when the left-wing student movement was incarcerated in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly study support and by opening more free public universities.
He said that the lack of unemployment and education was driving young criminals.
The U.S. should double the funding of artificial intelligence
The U.S. should double the funding used to investigate artificial intelligence when China enhances its operations, thus saying Google, Microsoft, and Apple-working financier Kai-Fu Lee.
The opinion was preceded by communications on artificial intelligence in various parts of the U.S. administration, although the US lacks a formal artificial intelligence strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be a leading artificial intelligence developer by 2030.
“The double budget of artificial intelligence would be a good start when it comes to considering that other countries are so far behind the United States and that we are looking for the next breakthrough of artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
The double funding could double the likelihood that the next major artificial intelligence would be done in the United States, Lee said this week in a CNBC interview.
Lee's book \"The Great Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order\" was published this month through the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt edition. He works as CEO in Sinovation Venture, which has invested in one of China's most important artificial intelligence companies called Face+.
In the 1980s, he developed an artificial intelligence system at the Carnegie Mellon University, which hit the highest-ranked Othello player in the United States. Later, he worked as director of Microsoft Research and Google’s Chinese operations.
Lee congratulated the U.S. government on previous technology competitions such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next would be organized to identify future visionaries.
Lee says American researchers are working hard to get public aid.
“The academic influencers are not taken by China, but by large companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been recruiting universities’ tops in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States to step up their artificial intelligence efforts.
“I think the doctoral degree in artificial intelligence should be automatically awarded green cards,” he said.
China’s next generation of artificial intelligence development plans in July 2017.
The Chinese National Science Foundation grants funding to people working in academic institutions in the same way as the National Science Foundation and other state organisations grant money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is weaker in China, Lee said.
The U.S. Department of Defence Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center earlier this year, which aims to bring together the partners of the world of industry and academics, and the White House has also announced the formation of a special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
DARPA also announced a $2 billion investment in AI Next this month.
The NSF invests more than $100 million each year in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, the legislative initiative aimed at the establishment of the National Committee on AI has not progressed to months.
The Macedonians in the referendum to change the country's name
In a Sunday referendum, the Macedonians voted to change the country's name - the Republic of North Macedonia - the name change would solve the dispute of decades with Greece, which has prevented the country's efforts to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
In the opinion of the Greek state of Macedonia, the name of the Northern Neighbor is, in practice, a territorial requirement for its territory and has therefore opposed its access to the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the countries entered into an agreement on a new nomination, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign against the vote will raise doubts as to whether voting activity will reach the required 50% limit so that the result will be legal.
The question in the motion for a vote was: \"Are you on the side of NATO and EU membership by adopting an agreement with Greece?
The supporters of a change of name, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, are convinced that the price should be paid in order to enable Macedonia to become a member of both the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they could live in freedom as members of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” Olivera Georgijevska, a 79-year-old, said in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, many Members have said they respect the result of the vote in order to have a decisive effect.
The amendment of the name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the Central Election Board, no irregularities were reported by 13.
However, the voting activity was only 16 compared to 34 per cent of the previous 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66 per cent of the voters voted.
\"I came to vote for my children and our place in Europe,\" said Gjose Teneski, a 62-year-old, who voted for the capital in Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in the referendum on the change in the name of Macedonia in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, a 54-year-old, prepared a small stage and set the chairs in front of the tents erected by the boycotters in front of the Scottish Parliament.
“We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads up, not through the kitchen door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia as part of the Euro-Mediterranean integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership brings the needed investment in Macedonia, with an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I believe that more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He said, \"Yes, there is a voice that will strengthen our future,\"
The opinion poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research referred to the 30-43% voting activity in the referendum, i.e. the activity required below.
In another survey, 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote for the option.
In order to succeed in the referendum, voting activity must exceed 50% by one vote.
Failure of the referendum would be the first serious setback for the Western government after its rise in power in May of last year.
See: Manchester City Sergio Aguero hit the entire Brighton defense.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a clear record of Brighton’s defense in Manchester City 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
At 65 minutes, Aguero made his goal look ridiculous.
At the beginning of the picture, an Argentine player was fed from the middle of the field.
He found an empty space in the field by pushing through three Brighton protesters.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He took over one of the defenders and then left several others behind on the edge of Brighton's penalty zone.
After that, he found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English tip used its first touch within the penalty zone to give the ball back to Aguero, who passed the Brighton guard Mathew Ryan with a shot at the right corner of the paint.
Pep Guardiola, the city’s manager, told reporters that “Aguero has problems with his feet.”
“We told him to play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he made a goal in that time.
However, Sterling had already given the heavenly blues the advantage of a range of struggles.
The painting came on 29 minutes of the game.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton.
He gave me a beautiful pass to Leroy Sane on the left side.
Sane took a few touch before he sent the ball back to Sterling.
The Heavenly Blue attacker put the ball in the net just before the end.

Scherzer wants to be a joker in the game against Rockies.
The Nationals is out of play, so why try to start a start-up meeting?
However, Scherzer is always hoping to take over the feedout in a Sunday match against Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a drop-off match. They have one victory in the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western series.
Rockies caught at least a wild card from the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still aiming for their first division.
“Although we don’t have a bet, at least we can get up to the feedout, knowing that the atmosphere of the audience and the rest of the team here in Denver will create the most demanding competition position I’ve encountered this year.
Why do I not want to face the challenge?
Nationals have not yet published their beginner for Sunday, but they are, according to data, inclined to give Scherzer an opportunity in these circumstances.
Scherzer threw a training session on Thursday, and he would play his 34th match at the start and feed him on Sunday on his normal rest.

Trump campaigned in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation of his Supreme Court judge, Brett Kavanaugh, who spoke about the importance of Republican voting activity in the interim elections.
All our achievements are in the game in November.
We are five weeks away from the main election in our lifetime.
This is one of the great -- not just a campaign, but a campaign in full, and that's why I'm recycling everywhere to fight for excellent candidates, he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, terrible group of radical Democrats, you see it happening right now.
They've decided to return to power by whatever means they can, and you can see their vanity and their hatred.
They don't choose who they are harming or who they need to rock so they can get into power. That's what they want, power, and power, but we don't give it to them.
He said the Democrats took up the task of resisting and preventing...
\"And it has been seen in the last four days,\" he said, calling the Democrats \"wrong and evil and false.\"
He referred to Diane Feinstein as the longest-influential Democratic Senator of the Senate's Committee on Justice, and the public responded with voiced bouts.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you run the document?
Uh, uh, what?
Well, no, I'm looking forward to a little - it was really bad for the body language - the worst of the body I've seen.
Labour is no longer a tolerant church.
It does not tolerate those who say their opinion.
I was not surprised when my local party, Momentum activists, supported a statement of distrust against me.
At least I am the last representative of Labour, who is told that I am not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way only because he resisted anti-Semitism.
In my case, the distrust clause was critical of the fact that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
Related issues related to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, irony are similar topics which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour meeting said Friday that “we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
The majority of the eight years I have served as a local representative of Labour have been precisely the size of the party council on Friday.
Now many meetings do not follow that tone, and – more friendly and gentleer – policy has long since been forgotten if it ever started.
It is even more clear that the Labour Party no longer tolerates differing opinions and that every opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is appropriate for party leaders or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader. The colleagues with whom I thought I had shared a similar political view began to expect me to have a full translation and contributions that I would never have agreed to, whether it was national security or the internal market of the EU.
Every time I speak publicly - and it doesn't really matter what I say - the result of the insults in social media, which requires the withdrawal of my choice, the rejection of a central policy, and I can hear that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my own experience.
I know that I am more lucky than some of my colleagues because the comments I have made are of a political nature.
I greatly respect the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexist and racist insults every day, and never snore.
Normalization of caltomy treatment is one of the most disturbing aspects of this era's policy.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn demanded that the Labour Party adopt a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different opinions, and with every distrust or change in the rules of choice, the party becomes only more limited.
For two years, I have been asked to keep a low profile and refrain from expressing my thoughts so that everything goes well.
But that's not the reason I went to politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a result of the neglect of the Government of Thatcher to a single school, I have tried to promote better public services for those who need them most.
I have never covered my political line, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East district has been surprised by my views or differences with my current leadership.
For those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that when the state is moving towards a brexit that hinders households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy to question my trust in the leadership of the Labour Party.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters: I represent you with honor, and the threat of separation or the promotion of a political career does not prevent me from acting in a way that I think is in your interest.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Unbeatable Ayr blockchain
Two last minute goals slightly distorted the outcome of the match, but without doubt Ayr earned a win in the entertaining Tenent's Premiership game of the day.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team of ten who have not lost any matches.
The excellent defense and more successful taking of risks was ultimately what supported them, and coach Peter Murchie can be satisfied for this reason.
“We have been challenged in our games, and we are still undefeated, so I can be satisfied,” he says.
Melrosen Robyn Christie says, \"All glory to Ayr, they took risks better than we did.
Ayr took the lead in 14 minutes with Grant Anderson's goal and Frazier Climon's successful conversion kick, but the yellow card of Captain Roy Hughes, who was given to the game by Warriors, allowed Melrose to rise, and Jason Baggot made the goal.
Climo raised Ayri's leadership in a criminal painting, and just before midnight, he scored a goal and succeeded in the conversion kick by increasing Ayri's management readings 17-5.
But Melrose started another batch well with Patrick Anderson's goal, which Baggot managed to narrow the gap to five points.
There was a long delay in the match when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and applied out of the field. During the game, Ayr continued to raise his lead with Stafford McDowaall's goal, which Climo succeeded in converting.
Captain Ayrin Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, after which Melrosen Bruce Colvine made a goal that the conversion kick failed.
However, the team answered when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card from a ballless Climo hacking, and Macpherson scored a paint on the bottom of the Ayri maul that left the sideline.
Climo succeeded in the conversio kick in the same way as before, and Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and made Gregor Henry finish the fifth goal of the home team.

The actor himself refused to comment on the information, but the source of the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to participate in the thriving restaurant business of Glasgow.
“Meri belongs to us: the country of the country Bolivia is trying to get back into touch with the Pacific Ocean by law.
Marines patrol the naval base outside of La Paz.
In the flags of public buildings, the sea blue flag is lit.
The ship’s bases from Titicaca to Amazon have been crushed by a slogan: “Rightfully, the sea belongs to us.
Getting it back is our duty.
In Bolivia, a memory of the shoreline lost in the Battle of Resources in the 19th century is still strong – as is the longing to sail on the Pacific Ocean once more.
The hope is at its highest level for decades when Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of reflection.
\"Bolivia has strong progress, cohesive spirit and perseverance, and of course a positive attitude in waiting for the final solution,\" said Roberto Calzad, a diplomat in Brazil.
Several of the Brazilians around the country follow the International Court of Justice’s decision on the big squares, hoping that the Hague will be in favour of – at the end of the decade’s broken debate – of Bolivia’s position that Chile has an obligation to grant Bolivia independent access to the sea.
Bolivia's charismatic president Evo Morales, who will face the re-election of the controversial battle next year, will have a lot to play next Monday.
\"The return to the Pacific Ocean is very close,\" he assured the end of August.
Some analysts, however, believe that the court is not likely to decide in the interests of Bolivia, and even if it did, the situation would not change much.
The Dutch-controlled UN institution does not have the power to hand over Chile's administrative areas, and ICJ has also announced that it will not impose a final outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that ICJ’s decision is only given six months after the final submission of the statements suggests that the case is not complex, Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
In addition, the last four years have slowed down rather than promoted Bolivia's goal.
“The current Bolivian administration has taken the question of sea connection,” Zárate said.
The rhetoric that challenges Morales has suppressed the rest of the kindness of the Chileans, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue discussions at some point, but it will be very difficult to organise negotiations.
Neither country has had another embassy since 1962.
The former President and Bolivian representative in the Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, does not accept the view that the Court’s decision would have been exceptionally quick.
Monday or Monday will give Bolivia an exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile, and the opportunity to stop the 139-year-old differences in mutual benefit, he said.
Calzad also denies that Morales, one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, would have used the issue of shipping as a political support.
\"Bolivia will never surrender her right to the Pacific Ocean,\" she added.
“It’s time for us to move forward from the past.”
North Korea has announced that nuclear pollution will not happen unless it can trust the United States.
North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first, unless they can trust Washington, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He reminded the United States to keep the promises made by the Heads of State at the Singapore Summit.
Rin’s statement came just before US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo is re-initiating in the nuclear weapons of the deadlocked diplomacy, only three months after the United States met Kim Jong Unin in Singapore.
Ri said there was a “long dream” to believe that the continued sanctions and the U.S. opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean war would bring North Korea to its knees.
Before Pjongjang has first taken significant measures to promote armed conflict, Washington is in reserve for the adoption of the Declaration.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a new summit.
But the view that Pjongjang would be about to give up the armed arsenal, which the State is likely to see as the only real means to guarantee its own security, has become a widespread suspect.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pjongjang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump Summit.
Paris fashion screens show the latest large sized headtops, which will soon be your next street.
If you want to increase your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you do not need to continue searching.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed in their SS19 model screens a selection of special oversized heads that would dazzle the style circles of Paris’s fashion weeks.
The very unpractical heads took on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their amazing creations to fashion displays as well.
Valentino’s most striking creation was a beige hat with wide steam cylinders, which covered almost entirely the heads of models.
Other oversized outfits were, among other things, a watermelon decorated with jewelry, a debt-covered and even ananas – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of distinctive masks – just right before Halloween.
Several colorful masks had sewn lips, and they resembled more Hannibal Lecter than top fashion.
One creature with snorkel and mask resembled more diving equipment, and the other resembled the melting of ice cream.
And if you want to carry a large-scale fashion, you're lucky.
Fashion followers predict that the huge peaks are appearing in the street.
Excessive hats are closely followed by La Bomba, a half-meter straw hat that has been seen from Rihan to Emily Ratajkowski.
In the social media, an unconventional hat cultural material also made the second size of the creation’s fashion display – a beer-made beach bag that is almost as large as the model that carries it.
Burned orange striped-flavoured raffle with white leather hand straps had the most striking creation of the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 model with Paris fashion designers.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I think I’m seeing large-scale hats and beaches in the street next summer – designers have made such a big impression that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-scale outfits.
John Edward: Language Skills is a Key Skill for a World People
The learning results of private schools in Scotland have traditionally been good, and this success has also continued in 2018 as a result of good test results. Success has been enhanced by individual and community success in sport, art, music and other community projects.
These schools of over 30,000 students located across Scotland, represented by the Scottish private school delegation SCIS, strive to produce a high-quality service for their students and students’ parents.
Private schools strive to prepare their students for their chosen careers, continuing and higher education, and world citizenship.
As a training business that can design and implement customized study content, we have noticed the position of languages as a popular and desirable subject in continuous educational institutions.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a person in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to a person in his own language, the message goes into his heart.
This is a strong reminder that we cannot only rely on English if we want to create relationships with people from other countries.
From the latest results of this year, we find that languages are at the top of the lists in terms of the percentage of access between private schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved the highest rating of A.
The material was collected from 74 schools belonging to SCIS. Based on the subject, it was found that students who received the highest rating of A, 72 per cent studied Mandarin Chinese, 72 per cent studied German, 69 per cent studied French and 63 per cent studied Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign language learning as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently free-choice materials, but are considered to be of the same value as natural materials (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the private school study programme and elsewhere.
On the basis of a survey conducted by the UK Employment Office in 2014, 17% of the cases where the employer had difficulty finding a suitable employee’s job were explained by a lack of language skills.
Therefore, the development of language skills is even more necessary in order to promote the career development of the young future.
The more possible tasks require language skills, the more essential these skills will become in a global world.
If a person has studied another language, he will have an advantage over this lifelong skill in the future, regardless of what career he has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner will automatically put a skilled person ahead of the competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013, 75% of adults with more than 4,000 isbritannia are unable to talk in a foreign language, and France was the only language with a two-digit number of 15%.
That is why investing in language teaching is important now for children.
In particular, the knowledge of the languages of developing countries gives children a better chance to find a meaningful career.
Within Scotland, schools differ in what languages they teach.
Many schools focus on traditional languages, while some teach specifically languages that are expected to be important for the IBBs in 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese and Japanese.
Despite the interests of your child, there are always several language options taught by specialized teachers in private schools.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future will bring.
In this time, it cannot be denied that languages in the international business environment will continue to be very important for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Today’s languages should indeed be seen as “international communication skills”
Private schools will continue to offer this freedom of choice, diversity and high-level Scotland for young people.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is head of the Scottish private school council SCIS
LeBron makes a debut on Sunday in San Diego
LeBron James’s premiere in Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers Coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play on Sunday against Denver Nuggets in San Diego before the start of the season in a game to be played.
But how many minutes he really plays, will be seen.
“It will be more than one, and less than 48,” Walton said on the official website of Lakers.
The Lakers journalist Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably be playing the silent minutes.
James, who followed the exercises, was asked earlier this week about his plans for the six matches to be played before the Lakers.
At this point in my career, I don't need any more pre-games to prepare for this, he said.
Trump's Western Virginia campaign time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of election campaigns today in Wheeling in West Virginia.
It is Trump’s first five election events scheduled for the next week, including compassionate destinations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While waiting for his election to fill the seat of the Supreme Court judge, Trump seeks to increase support for future interim elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing a majority in Congress in November elections.
What time is the Trump West Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
The Trump West Virginia Wheeling event begins at 19 o’clock on Saturday, 29 September 1998.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia campaign online as live streaming through YouTube by clicking below.
Trump takes the view that this week's Supreme Court can be heard by Brett Kavanaugh, a judge of the Supreme Court, who has been charged with violent sexual harassment, which has delayed the Senate's vote of ratification in the week after the FBI's investigation.
But the primary goal for the campaign series is to support the success of Republican candidates in a tight November election.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign was commented on the purpose of the next week's five events is to encourage volunteers and profitable Republicans to protect and expand the majority of the Senate and the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
“The management of Congress is so essential for his purpose that the President is willing to travel to as many states as possible during the busy campaign period,” Trump’s anonymous representative told Reuters.
Today’s event is at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, and there are even the supporters from Thailand and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump’s second visit to West Virginia during the month, where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump supports Republican Senator Patrick Morrisey, who has been left behind in opinion polls.
“For Morrisey, it’s not a good sign that the president is trying to increase his support in opinion polls,” states a state scientist Simon Haeder from the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows a struggle to keep hope ahead of Sunday's solo games
After a three-sided session, Saturday afternoon four-games were exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
Although the strength of self-confirming success is a completely invented phenomenon in sport, players still believe in it, and even more in such tournaments.
Where do they think this success is at the moment?
“They had a six-point position that narrowed down to four, so we take this success force as a hippie,” said Jordan Spieth, walking away at the end of the day.
Europe has, of course, an advantage position: four points ahead and 12 playable.
The Americans, as Spieth said, feel that they have a little wind in the sails and a lot of what to encourage, such as Spieth and Justin Thomas's condition, which enabled them to play together all day and received three points in four.
Spieth has been superior to the road to the green, leading with an example.
The loud throats of the victory party were strengthened as his round progressed, when he succeeded in a critical bag to smooth the match to four when he and Thomas were two points behind two holes.
Putt, in which they won the 15th match, followed a similar cry, which gave the idea that he believed that the U.S. team had not yet lost.
“You have to focus very well and just take care of your own game,” Spieth said.
That's the only thing these players have left.
18 holes to influence.
The only players who have received more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Ryder Cup's undisputed legends of Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's special, but the sweet twin has won four out of four flawless.
“Moliwood was the only two who didn’t make any bogia on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bugs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That tour, and the way they give and receive energy from this gloomy audience, confirms that they are the pre-sorts of Sunday. And when the sun drops in Le Golf National, another more popular player to ensure Europe’s potential victory could not be like Fleetwood and Molinari.
I prefer both at the same time with different holes.
The words about Europe's success are premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, paired with Alex Noren, who was the hero of the four-game in the morning.
One bug and two double-bogia in the first nine holes dug the Spanish and Swedish so deep into the hole that they were not near to survive there.
But on Sunday, no one should help you out of the hole.
Four ball and four games are fascinating to follow from the perspective of a couple of collaborations: what kind of advice they give or leave without giving and how the strategy can change in the instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead before the last day, but this four-game showed that the US team has a battle-like attitude, although in particular in the United States it has been suspected.
Europe takes 10-6 leadership before the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe is in good leadership before the last day of Ryder Cup, after they took on Saturday in four balls and four games in 10-6 leadership stations from the United States.
The excellent twin Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the winning race with two winnings from the rapper Tiger Woods, and got the score balance high to four points today at Le Golf National.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, who worked hard to maintain the victory in Hazeltin two years ago, was weakly dominated by the U.S. team in the morning four-ball, taking the game to a situation of 3-1.
The United States was a tougher opponent in four games, winning two matches, but they were unable to narrow down the leadership position.
Jim Furykin needed eight points from Sunday 12 to keep the victory.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row. He and Molinari, also known as \"Molliwood\", were the second two in Ryder Cup history after the sensational weekend, which has won four points in the first four games.
First, after breaking into four balls of Woods and Patrick Reed, they later completed the top-ranked Woods and the US beginner Bryson Dechambeau even more pontically 5-4.
Woods, who barely survived through the two matches on Saturday, was sometimes brilliant, but has lost 19 of his 29 matches in four ball and four games, and even seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested in the morning four balls, but he and Henrik Stenson returned to four games, but lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the first and third in the ranking.
Europe did not get everything in its best way in this fresh and pleasant day from Paris to lunch.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high goal for the U.S. two points on Saturday.
They acquire a wealth of 2-1 wins from the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four balls, and later 4-3 wins from Poulter and Roy McIlroy in four games after losing two first holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history, the team has climbed four points from behind to levels when the two games begin, even though Furyki side also has a tie to maintain victory.
However, after two days, the second best can be that the Sunday counterattack has been too requested.
North Korea - in no way - removes itself from weapons without trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions only increased confidence in the United States, and under these circumstances there is no possibility that North Korea would unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
At the UN General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea has taken a number of positive measures over the last year, as the nuclear and missile tests have ceased, decommissioned a nuclear test site and promised that North Korea will not increase the number of nuclear weapons or technology.
“But we haven’t seen a similar gesture from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure that national security will be preserved, so in such circumstances that we will be able to remove ourselves from arms unilaterally, it is not possible.
Although Ri reiterated the known appeal flow that Washington did not accept the phased abandonment of nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded for every interdependence, his statement is, however, significant in the sense that one-sided armed conflict would not be completely excluded, as Pjongjang has previously done.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first US President and North Korea summit in Singapore on 12 June, Kim convinced the Korean Peninsula of the removal of nuclear weapons and Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea’s security.
North Korea has attempted to formally decide the Korean War between 1950 and 1953, but the United States has called for Pjongjang to give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also opposed the facilitation of strict international sanctions for North Korea.
“The United States are calling for a “nuclear removal first,” and they have increased the pressure through sanctions to reach their goals by force – even in opposition to the declaration of peace,” Ri said.
“It is a blessing that sanctions will get us on our knees is the hope of the indifferent.
But the problem is that constant sanctions only deepen our distrust.
Ri did not mention the plans of the next Kim-Trump Summit, however, which Trump himself stressed to the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings with the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: “If a party requiring the arms removal had been South Korea and not the United States, the situation would not have progressed to such a deadlock.
However, Ri's tone was significantly different last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the direction of missiles towards the continental regions was inevitable after, unfortunately, President Trump called Kim as a suicide-armed man.
Last year, Trump threatened to completely destroy North Korea. This year, however, Trump urged Kim to bring this courage to a close to the ceasefire, but still stressed that there was still a lot of work to be done and the sanctions should remain for as long as North Korea abandoned its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump mentioned that he had no time limit: “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.
China and Russia proposed that the UN Security Council should be rewarded for the progress already made by Pjongjang.
However, the U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that \"The strengthening of the security Council's sanctions must continue to be strong and without failing until we witness the full, final and strengthened abandonment of nuclear weapons.
The Security Council has unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with the aim of suppressing the funding channels for the production of ballistics and nuclear missiles in Pjongjang.
Pompeo met at the UN General Assembly of the North Korean Rin, and he also announced that he would return to Pyongjang next month for preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit was not smooth.
When he left Pjongjang, he described the progress made, but North Korea condemned Pompeon's gangsteric requirements - only a few hours later.
North Korea committed itself to the closure of the missile base and nuclear facility at the meeting with Secretary General Moon earlier this month, in the event that the United States takes the appropriate measures.
According to Pompeo, with the measures to be taken, Kim means security guarantees to which Trump committed at the meeting with Singapore and the transition towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students complete a sufficient resting course
All primary students at Harvard University attend this year’s course to increase student rest. The course is a response to the macho culture flourishing at the university, where students are pushing for a long night with caffeine power.
According to the researcher, students from the world’s best university are often quite ignorant of their basic well-being.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of medical faculty at Harvard University, working in a unique study at Brigham and Women's Hospital, believes the course is the first in the United States.
Czeisler received an idea for his course of study on the impact of sleep shortages on learning.
“After reading, there came a young woman who said, “Why do I hear about it only now, in my last year of study?”
No one had ever told him about the need for a dream, which I think was surprising, he told me about the telegraph interview.
For the first time this year, the course will guide students on how true uniqueness supports academic and athletic performance and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of medical faculty at Harvard University and vice-president of university health services, says the University’s graduate course was organized after they had heard how students were suffering from serious sleep shortages during the week of study.
An hour-long course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, students will be given a picture of the apartment room where the student can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books, and thus get information on the effects of caffeine and light, as well as on the impact of sleep shortages on sports performances and the importance of regular evening activities.
In the second section, participants are told how long-term sleep deficiency can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know that this does not have an immediate impact on the behavior of students.
However, we believe that they have the right to know these things in the same way as they have the right to know about the health effects of smoking,\" added Professor Czeisler.
Throughout the night, long-term learning marathons are still a subject of pride, according to Professor Czeisler, and the ever-growing pressures of modern technology and students made sleep shortages a growing problem.
“To have a high-quality sleep should be against stress, fatigue and anxiety of students, and even weight gain, because sleep shortages cause hunger in the brain, which is why people are constantly hungry, the professor points out.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical psychology in California, helped Professor Czeisler in designing a course after he had attended one of the courses he taught in his first year at Harvard last year.
He says the course opened his eyes and gave a boost to all campus students to organize a comprehensive course.
He hopes that all graduate students will be able to carry out a similar study set before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set up a wake-up clock to remind them of sleeptime in addition to morning awakening, and calls on them to keep in mind the adverse effects caused by electronic monitors and LED lighting-blue light on daily rhythms, which may make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's shot took victory from Gerard's players
Steven Gerrard and Rangers once again experienced a new day of defeat when Dolly Menga's shot through the broken defense brought Livingston a 1-0 win.
Ibrox's players were going to win their first win since February 4-20, which went against St. Johnstone. However, Gary Holt's team took the victory this time, and Gerrard only suffered his second loss during his 18-game manager's career. Rangers remained eight points on the head of the poll from the current leader Hearts.
Menga shot the ball seven minutes before the middle of the day, and the situation was no longer balanced after that with the downfall of Rangers.
The Rangers fell to the sixth position as a result of the game. Livingston has instead climbed to the third position, and the goal difference is higher only in the hibernia.
Rangers may have other problems in front of them, for Calum Spence was injured during the game in the event of an object thrown out of the guest eye, and the wound has to be treated.
Gerrard made eight exchanges in the composition with which the team had hit Ayr and advanced to the semi-finals of the Scottish league.
At the same time, Holt continued with the Liv 11 meeting, where the team took a point from Hearts last week. The same strategy again produced results when the well-structured composition managed to punish the opponent almost every turn.
Although Rangers managed to dominate the possession of the ball, Livingston was better to use the situations for their own advantage.
Livingston had an opportunity to get a goal for two minutes already, when Menga's first feed gave Scott Pittman a free trip to Allan McGregor's goal, but Pittman failed to take advantage of the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed his free kick to Craig Halketti, but the other defender Alan Lithgow was only able to shoot wide back to the back.
Rangers took control of the game on the other hand, but the last third of the game was no longer self-confidence.
Alfredo Morelos demanded punishment when at fifteen minutes he and Steven Lawless had run into each other, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian request.
Rangers managed to try only two goals in the first half. Former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly, however, refused to bother Lassana Coulibaly's buffer and Ovie Ejarian's powerless shot.
Livingston's goal for 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but the situation wasn't just due to the hard work of the team.
Rangers could still not do anything for Jacobs' long-term feed tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fed Scott Robinson, which was cold-paced to the ball Menga for easy paint.
At the exchanger, Gerrard decided to switch to Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent on the field. The shift affected the game almost immediately when Kent created a suitable hole for Morelos. However, the attack was interrupted by Kelly’s impressive rapid defense.
Livingston made visitors play their own game again, while Lithgow and Halket continued long feeds after each other.
The Dutch team had the opportunity to raise its lead in the last moments of the game. However, McGregor's fine defense prevented Jacobs' intentions before Lithgow could get to his positions at the corner.
Glenn Middleton, who had become a Rangers exchange, also demanded a ranking kick after taking Jacobs together, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanakka: Geigermetari inventor
The following is our “Sunday Morning” novel: September 30, 1882. John Wilhelm-Hans-Geiger, a future physicist, was born in Germany 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. The invention later led to the development of a device known as a geigerometer.
The method became one of the supporting pillars of science, and also a key concept of pop culture. For example, the well-published 1950 movie Coronado watches – where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans are presenting scientists that are quite impressive to cattle:
Man: \"What a miracle is that...
Rogers: “It’s a geigerometer. It’s used to search for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put earphones on your ears, you can actually hear the effect of radioactive radiation on the minerals.
Evans: “Look, it really is. . .
\"Hans- Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63th birthday.
The idea that carries his name still lives.
New cancer vaccine is capable of teaching the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ malicious cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment
In the process, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and altered in the laboratory
After treatment, the cells injected back into the body are able to ‘see’ a number of typical proteins for eating.
The dog bag has provided promising results in patients with various cancers.
For example, the cancer cells of the ovarian cancer patient disappeared within 18 months after being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect malignant cells.
In the process, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and altered in the laboratory so that they are able to ‘see’ the typical HER2 proteins for many cancers. The converted cells are eventually injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, USA describes the method: “This is a very promising vaccine based on our findings.
The HER2 guide for the growth of several types of cancers, Professor Berzofsky explains. \"These include breast cancer and ovarian, lung and colon cancers.
A similar approach – taking resistant cells from the patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells has also produced results in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West was put in the teeth of critics after the Trump Saturday Night Live campaigned in his head.
The show didn't go according to plans.
Kanye West got his neck off the bouts of Saturday Night Live after praising the dirty style of President Donald Trump and announced that he would be the president of the 2020 election.
After presenting his third song on Ghost Town, Trump Make America Great Again, West attacked the Democrats and repeated its support to President Trump.
“When I talk to a white person, they ask me how I can support Trump because he’s racist.
If racism had been a problem, I would have changed America a long time ago, he said.
The evening's mission began with a stroke in which Matt Damon dismissed Brett Kavanaugh's hearing in the Senate's justice committee. The hearing was related to the claims made by Christine Blasey Ford about the sexual harassment of Kavanaugh.
West's fasting was not presented in direct transmission, but the comedian Chris Rock downloaded it into a split social media.
It's unclear if Rock's purpose is to mock West with his post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had been treated in the bowls because of the hat he held on his head.
I was bullied behind the scenes.
I was told I shouldn't go on stage with this hat in my head.
I've been bullied!
And then they say I'm in the margin, and the West says in Washington Examiner's interview.
The West continues: “Do you want to see what the margin of being is and say you’re wearing a Steel Man’s note because you can’t tell me what I’m doing. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to be loving.
According to Variety, West’s comments made the public laughs at least twice, and the show’s performers looked embarrassed. One of the present described the situation as follows: “The entire studio was completely quiet.
West was selected for the program at a brief warning time to replace Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused confusion in many viewers by presenting \"I love it\" as a Perrier bottle.
The West is supported by the conservative TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who praised this courage on Twitter: \"KITOS KUN NEWS
But Karen Hunter said that the West would only be itself, which is always wonderful.
“I can, however, decide on the human being (by buying this music or a costume or by supporting this art, which I believe to be a supportive and harmful ideology for my community.
He's a free man.
The same goes for us, he added.
Prior to the night’s appearance on Twitter, the rapper announced that he had changed his name to a person known as Kanye Westa.
West is not the first artist to change his name. The musician follows Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The second rapper, Snoop Dogg, was also known as Snoop Lion, and of course we also remember the late musical legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and later as an artist known as Prince.
The Belfast restaurant manager is charged with the murder attempt.
A 45-year-old man is accused of a murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident was reported by the police in the Ballyhackamore area.
The accused is expected before the Belgian court on Monday.
The prosecution will be checked by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Guitar Harington is attacking toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is known for his sword-reflecting hero roles in Jon Snow's violent fantasy series of HBO.
Harrington, however, has attacked the stereotype of machosankar: According to a 31-year-old actor, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned by virtue of virtue.
In an interview with the cultural connector of the Sunday Times, Harrington suspects that “somebody has gone wrong” and questions the means in place to intervene in toxic masculine in the era of the #MeToo phenomenon.
Recently, Harrington, a 31-year-old Rose Leslie, has admitted that he has a strong desire to address the subject.
“The question of where we have gone wrong with masculinity is that I am currently experiencing strong feelings,” he says.
“What men have learned in the years of their growth, which has now led to perceived problems.”
Harrington believes that television and its highly masculine characters are partly responsible for increasing toxic masculine.
He continues: “What is native and what is learned?
What will be learned on TV and on the streets that make young boys feel they need to be certain to be men?
I think this is one of the great questions of our time – how can we change this?
The young men have something really wrong.
In the interview, he also admits that he would not participate in the production of the front or sequel parts of the Revolutionary Game after the series ends next summer, because he has, according to his own words, had the need for battle fields and horses.
In November, Harrington will be seen in a new version of Sam Shepard’s play True West, which tells about the film producer and his brother.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his future Rose wife was the best thing that the Powerstudent game has offered him.
“I killed my wife on this show, so somehow it gave me my future family and life from now on,” she says.
Rose Leslie was playing Ygritte, a game of Jon Snow's love at the Emmy Award in the fantasy series by Harrington.
The couple was married in June 2018 at the Leslie family premises in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: The number of new infections has increased by 14% in China
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-infected citizens.
According to health authorities, the virus affects more than 820 000 people in the country.
About 40,000 new cases have been reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
A clear majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, meaning change in previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through blood transfusions in some parts of China.
However, according to the Chinese health authorities at a conference held in the province of Yunnan, HIV intakes in this way have been reduced to almost zero.
However, a year later, the number of HIV infected and AIDS patients in China has risen by 100,000 cases.
Sex through HIV intakes are an acute issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been reported to be common.
Studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women, due to the conservative values of the country.
Many diseases are caused by insufficient protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has pledged to ensure the availability of HIV medicines as part of the problem-solving measures.
Maxine Waters denies the data of a Republican explorer leaked by the employee and accuses the dissemination of dangerous lies and conspiracy theories.
On Saturday, U.S. representative room member Maxine Waters denied the claims that his employees would have published personal information about the three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic Representative from Los Angeles confirmed that there are “extremists” and websites as distributors of claims.
“White, false, and contemptful lies,” Waters said in his statement on Twitter.
Among the published data were the home addresses and telephone numbers of Senator Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Senators Mike Leen and Orrin Hatchi, representing Utah.
An unknown person published information about the U.S. Congress on Thursday during the hearing of the Senate Committee.
The leak occurred shortly after three senators had interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Punds and RedState report that, according to Hillin, the messages were released from the IP address connected to the Waters Office and by a person belonging to Waters staff.
“This unjustified accusation is completely wrong and it’s an absolute lie,” Water continued.
“My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised due to these fraudulent and false accusations, has no form of liability for the leaking of these data.
This unjustified accusation is totally wrong and absolutely false.
Waters' statement was quickly criticized on the Internet, and critics also included former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“The death he denies this is very hostile,” Fleischer wrote.
“It seems that his character is not suitable for a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he has no reason to behave hostilely.
There's no reason to be threatened.
There is no reason to question the prosecutor's motives.
The situation should be moderately and calmly –
Fleischer seemed to compare the response of Waters to the criticism of the Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during Thursday’s hearing.
The Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who competes with Waters in the congressional elections, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
\"Unbelievable if this is true,\" he tweeted.
Waters announced in his opinion that he had contacted the relevant authorities and law enforcement bodies for these fraudulent accusations.
\"We believe that the authors will be revealed, he continued, and that they will be brought under legal responsibility for all or all of the destructive and dangerous measures directed at the members of my staff,\" he said.
Johnny English strikes again – a low-powerd Rowan Atkinson agent barodia
It is already established tradition to search for Brexit references from any film that is going to be poured to Britain. However, this does not seem to be suitable for Johnny English agent industry and operating comedy series, which began in 2003 on Johnny English and re-invigorated in the 2011 follow-up part of \"Johnny English – Newborn\".
Can the language from the satire of the nation in the cheek become a new national export success in the UK?
Yes or so, a dick-eyed, rubber-like and incompetent Johnny English has earned their permission to repeat the tyranny. Already his name tells us, above all, that it is a comic creation aimed at the outside of the English-speaking world film market.
Of course, it’s about the foolish secret agent who desperately seeks to survive the melting glamour, but appears to be a mix between the inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean and the unlucky musician at the London opening concert in 2012.
The base of Hahmo is a cosmopolitan and mystical world man who has been behind chaos, which has been presented by Atkinson in the already forgotten state of the Barclaycard TV.
The last performance is a moment.
I especially thought of a scene where Johnny English arrives in a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor, and the swator's lavas bump into his helmet.
Atkinson’s physical comedy gifts come out, but the humor itself seems sub-powerful and strangely unnecessary, especially because the ‘serious’ film brands, such as 007 and the dangerous task today provide humor as part of the main content of the film.
The humor affects the children, and I don’t think Johnny English’s confused treatment seems to be as clever and sharp as the comedy of Mr. Bean’s mystical roles.
A recurring starting point every year is that the UK is in trouble for the worst time.
The cyber hacker is infiltrated in the UK’s top-secret spy network and reveals the identity of all British agents in the field as a tyranny of a service agent – which is presented as Kevin Eldon’s unfortunate little role performance.
This is the last drop for the prime minister on the surface, who is already ready for his ears after political dissatisfaction: Emma Thompson does everything in the mask of Teresa May, but the script does not only provide enough space for him.
When notifying the intelligence advisors that all the spies on the field have been revealed, someone who has already moved aside from the active service must be invited to the wedding.
It is, of course, a whimsical Johnny English in his own person. He spends his retirement days as a fine school teacher, but at the same time gives informal lessons in spying in the noble skills. The topic is adorned by some clever jokes; English holds school of Rock types of lessons in intelligence halls.
English will be thanked for the emergency meeting at Whitehall, where he will meet again with his infinitely patient partner, Bough, which will continue to be played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a dive boater whose role Vicki Pepperdine does not seem to have access to his rights.
So the catastrophic Batman and Robin have returned to his Majesty's secret service to meet Olga Kurylenko's fateful supercriminal Ophelia Bhuletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is about to become a manipulative of the charismatic IT billionaire, and Jason Volta, acting by Jake Lacy, claims to be able to solve the British computer problems.
English and Bough’s odysseys become a farce at the same time: a pair of servings lights up a fine French restaurant and causes chaos in pursuit of a secret to Volta luxury yacht. The company is familiar with the Volta house through virtual glasses to end up in a clean anarchy in the real world.
Even the last aesthetics of the performers tend when they come to the final scene, but despite all the inviolability and attraction, the film still feels a little bit like a child audience.
The film can be considered moderate.
When watching Johnny English movies, I’ve been thinking about the same thing before: why is the British film industry unable to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would justify his talent?
The British Labour Party contests plans for a four-day work week at a five-day salary
The Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is considering a radical plan for British workers to work four days a week, but the salary would be paid for five days.
The party is told to transfer savings from demanding business leaders to workers in the form of an extra day off.
According to the plan, employees could enjoy the three-day weekend with the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea of the \"sopi\" party's economic programme and its plans to cover the policy for the benefit of the workers.
The Trade Unions Central Organization supports the transition to a four-day working week as a means of enabling workers to benefit from a changing economic situation.
The source of the High Level Labour Party tells the Sunday Times newspaper: “According to a review of the issue, it was announced before the turn of the year.
The change does not take place at the moment, but a four-day working week is a goal that is suitable for the party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the general industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support the idea: the British Green Party committed to supporting the transition to a four-day working week in connection with its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, the objective is not to receive indivisible support in Labour's lines.
The Labour Party spokesman notes: “The working week is not a party’s orientation, and the party is not considering such a shift.
John McDonnell, Minister of Finance of the shadow government, took advantage of a working conference last week to present his vision for the economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to recover power from non-growing dictatorships and entrepreneurs of companies of general interest.
Under the plans of the Minister of Finance of the shadow government, the current shareholders of the water companies should not be allowed to repay their share as a whole, as the government managed by Labour could carry out reductions on the basis of the identified abuses.
He also confirmed plans to set employees in corporate boards and to create inquisitive ownership funds, which would allow 10% of the private sector's share capital to be transferred to the management of employees. According to the plan, an individual employee would be paid up to a maximum of 500 pounds per year in dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are discussing a 60-minute program on whether an FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could change their mind.
The investigation of charges against the FBI judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed at least a week's final vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh as the Supreme Court judge. The delay also raises the question whether the outcome of the investigation could undermine the support of some Republican senators to Kavanaugh's appointment.
During the 60-minute program on Sunday, Scott Pelley asked the Republican Party Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether it would be possible for the FBI to find out things that would allow them to change their mind.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina colleague.
Then, of course, Kennedy said.
“I told you by the time I heard you, I said I’ve been talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened when the accusations came out, and asked him, “Did you do it?”
He was determined, determined, unambiguous,
Graham's voice, instead, looks like a stone.
“I’ve made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and that’s bomb-proof,” he said.
\"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following thing: Brett strongly denied it,\" said Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“No one of the people he appointed could confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see what could change.
What is the Global Civil Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival, held in New York on Saturday, is a music event that is as impressive as its mission: to eliminate poverty from the world.
The Global Citizen Festival now attracts tens of thousands of people to the New York Central Park lawns to listen to performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make known the real goal of the event: to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Civil Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Powery Project, an international advisory group aimed at eradicating poverty by increasing the number of people actively working to eliminate poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event (if it is not willing to pay a VIP ticket) the public must perform various tasks or actions, such as volunteering, send an email to the political decision-maker or call a call, or perform another act that disseminates awareness of the objectives of the project.
But how has Global Citizen been successful, now that it is 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding a free concert ticket a real way to persuade people to take action, or is it just one ‘clictivism’ among others – the idea that the world can be changed by signing an online address or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen announces its letter on behalf of more than 19 million different goals, starting in 2011.
According to this, these actions have encouraged political decision-makers to announce commitments and principles equivalent to more than $37 billion, which have been used in a way that affects the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and declarations on the basis of which more than $10 billion has already been spent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds achieved have already affected almost 649 million people worldwide.
The most important commitments include, for example, The Power of Nutrition, a group of investors and executives in the United Kingdom, committed to helping children develop their full potential – the Group committed to providing Rwanda with $35 million to decide on malnutrition in the country. This happened after activists had sent them 4 700 TVs as a result of the Global Civil campaign.
“With the help of the British government, donors, governments of different countries and the people of the world like you, we can transfer social injustice and malnutrition history to the magazines,” said the Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman to the public at a concert held in London in 2018.
The group also called on the British Government to take action to improve the nutrition of mothers and children with more than 5,000 works. The government has published funding for the \"Power\" project to combat malnutrition, which reaches 5 million mothers and children.
One of the questions on the website is often asked: “Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?
Global citizen's answer: \"This will be long and difficult, and many compression stones will be ahead of us.
However, we will succeed, such as the great civil rights struggles and the anti-apartheid movements before us, because together we are stronger.
Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are running a New York concert this year, and its star card includes artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae.
According to the U.S. Ministry of the Interior, the country can make it difficult to export energy by using the fleet as a barrier.
According to U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, Washington can, if necessary, resort to the help of its fleet to prevent the spread of Russian energy on the world market, including in the near future.
Zinke claims that Russia’s activities in Syria – the invitation of the legal government – are an excuse for the recognition of new energy markets in the region.
\"I believe that the reason for the presence of [Russia] in the Middle East is the transmission of energy, just as in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,\" Zinken said.
According to the authority, methods and methods are available to prevent this.
“The United States has the ability to keep the ships open with their fleet and, if necessary, to ensure that the energy they provide does not end up in the world market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the public about the event organised by the Energy Consumers Association, which is a non-profit group that is profiling as a voice stream for energy consumers in the United States.
He continued by comparing Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran by pointing out that it was the same thing.
“Iran and Russia’s economic alternative is more or less speculation, and the replacement of fuel in the second, he says, and describes Russia as the circus number of a single trick – based on fossil fuels.
Opinions are timely in a situation where Trump’s administration has sought to improve the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and to replace it with a much cheaper Russian LNG.
To enhance this, Trump's administration, including President Trump, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the \"unsuited\" project, Nord Stream 2, which according to President Trump is binding on the Moscow tolerance youth in Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the transmission capacity of the 110 billion cubic metres of the existing pipe, to be a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s opposition is purely economical, and considers it an example of unhealthy competition.
“I would like to believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose its supplier,” says Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak, after meeting US Minister of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US attitude has led to a counter-reaction in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industrial industry organisation in the country, the central industrial union of Germany, has called on the United States to stay separate from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I find it very problematic that the third country interferes with our energy supply – the head of the German industrial union Dieter Kempf recently said after the meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator of Massachusetts, is going to think carefully about the position in the presidential elections in 2020
The Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced that on Saturday he would be careful to become a presidential candidate after the interim elections.
Warren confirmed that he was considering the nomination at an open questionnaire in Holyoko, Massachusetts.
“It’s time for women to move to Washington and repair our defective regime, and this also means a woman at the head of the kingdom,” he said.
After the sixth day of November, I will carefully consider becoming a candidate for president.
Warren estimates that during President Donald Trump's opportunity to say that he is taking the country in the wrong direction.
“I’m worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he says.
Warren has been directly critical of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren wrote, I suppose we need an FBI investigation before we vote.
However, according to an opinion poll published on Thursday, the majority of Warren’s voters do not support this position in 2020.
According to a study conducted by Suffolk University’s Department of Political Research and Boston Globe, 58% of voters in Massachusetts do not support the appointment of a Senator.
32% supported the appointment.
Several respondents supported former Governor Deval Patrick's appointment with 38%, while 48% opposed the idea.
Other democratic candidates to the 2020 elections are, for example, former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press news agency, Biden has to formally decide on its nomination by January.
Sarah Palin refers to her son's military trauma at Donald Trump's election
Sarah Palin's son Track Palin, 26 spent a year in Iraq after recruiting in the armed forces in September.
Track Palin was arrested on Monday night and was charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son has to go through after I return home, I can well identify with other families that face the consequences and injuries of PTSD that our soldiers are returning home,” he told the public gathered at the Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest “a river horse in the living room” and said his son, like the other veterans, was a little changed to his home, they returned in hardship, and they returned to wonder if he and his fellow soldiers have respected what he and his army and the air forces have done for the benefit of this country.
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska. According to Washington police spokesman Dan Bennett, he was charged with domestic violence and abuse of women and domestic violence and gun treatment.
18 states and the Columbia Alliance support the new asylum policy
Eightteen states and the Columbia Alliance seek a change in the new line that has entered into force in the United States, according to which asylum is not granted to people fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
18 representatives of the state and the federal district have left a letter from friends of law on Friday in Washington. The letter supports asylum seekers who break the line, NBC News.
The full name of the lawyer has not been published in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions, which American Civil Liberty Union raised in August against the federal order.
He tells his partner and his sons from his violent gang that he was abused by the U.S. authorities that he was in need of asylum 20.7.
He was arrested in Texas.
The general prosecutor, who supported Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, a large part of which are native to the United States asylum seekers, states where gang violence and domestic violence are a problem for all levels of society.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed the decision of the Board of Appeal on asylum applications in 2014 that the undocumented migrants could apply for asylum on the basis of domestic violence.
In his statement on Friday, General Prosecutor Karl Racine, Columbia, said that the new line-up would ignore the decades of state, federal and international law.
“The law of the Contracting State requires that all asylum applications be resolved on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and that such an obstacle violates this principle,” the letter states.
The prosecutors also claim in the letter that access to asylum seekers would prevent practical damage to the United States economy, as the attackers are likely to become entrepreneurs and bring the necessary additional labour force.
In June, the General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration court to suspend the issue of asylum against victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
\"The place of refuge is intended for persons fleeing their country of origin because of persecution or fear caused by race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular class of society, or political opinion,\" Sessions announced in his opinion on the new asylum practice on 11 June.
The asylum was never meant to solve all the problems – even serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts for survivors continue in Palus – the number of deaths found has doubled.
For the survivors, the situation becomes even more serious.
“Tilanne is very tense,” says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming down her hot baby at an evacuation center in the ruined city.
“Ambulances will bring a minute of new bodies.
The clean water is low.
Residents return to their destroyed homes, pick up watery stuff, and try to save what else can be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured and 7.5 hospitals that have been damaged in the magnitude are full.
Some injured, such as Dwi Haris, who suffers from a fracture of the spine and shoulder, rest outside the hospital of the army, where patients are treated for continued, strong post-circumstances.
His eyes are filled with tears when he repeated how the fierce earthquake shaken the fifth floor of the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I stayed in the middle of the walls of the ruins, I think – Harris tells Associated Press, and tells me that he was in the city with his family as a wedding guest.
“I heard my wife scream for help, and then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe.
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of \"provotion\" by propaganda announcements.
The Chinese ambassador accuses Beijing of using the American magazine as a propaganda tool. This happens a week after the Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in the American daily newspaper, praising the mutual interests of the US-China trade agreement.
U.S. President Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to the entry of the China Daily newspaper in Des Moines Register, the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accused China of being involved in the Congress elections on 6 November. China has denied its claims.
Trump’s accusations of Beijing’s attempts to interfere with the US elections, according to the U.S. Reuters, mean a new phase in Washington’s expansion campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for a foreign government to spread notifications to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an ever-exploited trade war, where both sides impose customs duties on the export products of the opposite Party.
According to Chinese and American experts, the Chinese revenge tariffs were targeted at states such as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party at the beginning of the trade war.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and long-term Governor of the State of Iowa, says Beijing has done harm to the U.S. working population, farmers and businesses. Iowa is a major exporter of agricultural products to China.
China is now continuing to accelerate its provocations by publishing propaganda announcements in our own free press, while Branstad wrote in a statement published in Des Moines Register on Sunday.
“By expanding its propaganda, the Chinese government will benefit from the U.S.-rated free word and press tradition by placing a paid declaration in Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
Instead, different opinions on the streets of Peking appear only limited, and real, different opinions that Chinese citizens may not see at all about the alarming development of their economy. This is because the media is strictly in the tolerance of the Communist Party of China, he writes.
Branstad continues by saying that “one of the largest newspapers in China refused to publish the offer – the article he wrote, but not to specify what the paper is about.
Kavanaugh-fisko deports female voters from Republicans, analysts warn
The fact that many of the Republican tops stand behind and defend the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, according to analysts, can cause a counter-reaction, especially in the upcoming interim elections with female voters.
The feelings surrounding the case have been on the big tours, and most Republicans have already announced their desire to proceed in the vote.
“These things can’t be cancelled,” says Professor Grant Reeher from the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell Institute in The Hill on Saturday.
Reeher does not believe Senator Jeff Flaken (Republicans, Arizona) in the last minute's offer of angry voters to lay down the FBI investigation.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, and they will not forget tomorrow or November,” says Karine Jean-Pierre, Senior Counselor, and the spokesman for the National Reform Group MoveOn, according to a newspaper published in the capital on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters sang – November is coming – when the Senate’s ruling Republicans decide to proceed to Kavanaugh’s appointment, which happened despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s statement.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be predictable,” says Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst in the interview on the news site.
“People say that enthusiasm has already been high, and that’s true.
But it could be even bigger, especially in the case of the insecurity female voters and the younger voters, between the ages of 18 and 29 who often don’t vote because they don’t like the president.
Analysts anticipate a possible counter-reaction if Republicans progress with the confirmation before the Ford’s testimony against the highest court candidate in which this claimed sexual harassment.
“This is a mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee of NBC News at the beginning of the week.
“This is not just a committee vote or a final vote, or whether Kavanaugh is to be called into question. It is about how Republicans have acted on the matter and how they have treated the Fordia, Guy Cecil, the leader of the Democratic Party of the U.S. Party of the United States with regard to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided in whether they should believe in the testimony of the Ford or Kavanaugh in the tendency of a small majority to the latter.
According to YouGov’s new opinion, 41% of respondents believe in Ford’s testimony of witness, and 35% say they believe in Kavanaugh absolutely or probably.
In addition, 38% say that Kavanaugh is likely to have or will definitely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flaken's rushed forward, the FBI investigates Ford and at least one of the other charges brought by Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Ford proved to the justice committee that Kavanaugh was strangled in drinking at Ford when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims to have revealed to him the highest right candidate for membership in the student party of his genital body when they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to start the new Internet as a response to Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of World Wide Web, has launched a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on the Berners-Lee open source code for the Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide where their information is stored and who has access to any information.
In an interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes about Inrupt’s purpose of being “control of the world”
“It has to be done now,” he said, referring to his start-up business.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid’s technology to enable people to create their own-personal database – i.e. POD.
It may include contact lists, memory lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Black and Spotify all available on one browser at the same time.
In a personal data store, it is unique that it is completely blocked from the user who has access to any type of data.
The company calls it “the personal empowerment of information”
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to give resources, processes, and the skills required to bring Solid to everyone.
The company currently comprises the safety platform bought by Berners-Leen, Brucen, IBM, some hired developers working with the project, and a voluntary coders community.
Technology developers from all over the world can create their own distributed applications with tools available on the Intrust website. This is all available from this week.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether people should be able to offer a complete change where all their business models are translated into the main law together at night.
“We don’t ask for their consent to the matter.
In a book published on Saturday in Medie, Berners-Lee wrote the Inrupt task to provide commercial energy and ecosystem for the coherence and quality of the network built for the new Solid.
In 1994 Berners-Lee mulled the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Berners-Lee maintains its position as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute, also after the launch of Inrupt.
“I’m extremely optimistic about the next era of the network, watching the next time – Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The city remembers the first world-war hero priest
The city celebrates the only priest of the Church of England, who was awarded the Victoria Cross, as a soldier, after the events have been 100 years.
The sports medal was awarded to the colonel, Pastor Bernard Bath on 29.9.1918 due to the attacks on Belleglise and Lehaucourt villages.
The bath, however, was created four days later without ever knowing the highest honor of the British army.
Two of his grandchildren were revealing a memorial stone in Rushden, Northamptonshire last Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says that the event is a “emotional symbol” monument was revealed 100 years after his award-winning grandfather’s male.
According to London Gazetti, 29 9.1918 Colonel Vann led his battalion over the tight fog of Canal de Saint-Quent and under the fire of heavy field cannons and machine rifles.
Later, he fell on the front line and showed the greatest athletics – leading to the advancement of troops before his attack on the field alone. During the following battle, Vann poured out his own hand three cannon-patter soldiers.
Colonel Vann died a German sniper was created on 4.10.1918 – only a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's work was something I could never reach out to, something that raised respect.
Michael Vann He and his brother Dr. James Vann went into a fight after a successful parade by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band Orchestra.
Michael Vann says it is a great honour to take part in the parade, and added: “The great multitude of people is remembering the glory of the true hero.
Free play friends were looking forward to watching the Bellator 206 tournament all night long – the TV channel showed Pipsa Possua
Imagine a situation where you've been monitoring the entire night to watch the expected Bellator 206 tournament, and not to present the whole event.
The San Jose event program had 13 matches, six of which were to be played as a direct broadcast on Channel 5 in the UK.
Six in the morning, just as Gegard Moussa and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the ring, the program turned into a big shock to Pipsa Possu's viewers.
Some of the viewers were not really happy to watch for the whole night's match.
One of the friends of the free match opened on Twitter, describing replacing the match with children’s drawings as a sick joke.
According to the law, this content was not suitable to be presented at 6 a.m., so they had to change it to the children's program – explained Dave Schwartz, the senior marketing and communication director of Bellator, for the exchange of the programme.
\"Pipsa Possu, yes...
Scott Coker, director of the Bellator company, said that timetables will be scheduled to work so that British viewers can follow events in the future.
“I’m thinking about a retransmission we’ll probably get the program to work,” Coker said.
“The clock will be there in the morning, and we will not be allowed to present the program before Sunday in our time, which is Monday.
We're working in front of it.
You can believe that when the program changed in their head, messages began to go in the direction and to the other, and they were not all friendly.
We tried to correct the mistake because we thought it was a technical problem.
This was not the case, however, but it was a legislative matter.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We limited the number of matches to five instead of six, as usual. We tried to offer more to our fans and tried too much.
This is a sad situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior to her sexuality
Swimming jumper and Olympic athlete Tom Daley says he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this motivates him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete tells me that he didn’t realize when he came to high school that “all aren’t the same as me.”
In the Radio 4 Desert Island Discs program, Lauren Laverne spoke about gay rights in order to give others hope.
He also explains how winning at the Olympics was no longer so important after receiving the child.
The long-term radio programme’s regular runner, Kristy Young, has taken several months off because of the disease.
As a guest in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt young, \"better\" than everyone else, because \"it was not socially acceptable to keep boys and work\".
He says: “To this day, these feelings, feeling less and different, have been reality, and they have given me the power and the energy I have needed to succeed.
He says he wanted to show himself to be “somewhere” so that he would not disappoint everyone when his sexuality eventually became exposed.
The double Olympic propagandaist has become a high-profile LGBT activist, and he appears in the National Community competitions this year to appeal to the criminalisation of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came out because he feels lucky to be able to live openly without sanctions and wanted to give hope to other people.
A triple world champion tells his love for a man – a American filmmaker to Dustin Lance Black, which he met in 2013 as a surprise.
Daley married this 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but says that the age difference has never been a problem.
“If you experience so many things as a young person – she attended her first Olympics at the age of 14, and her father died of cancer three years later – it’s hard to find another person of the same age who would have experienced the same kind of controversies and contradictions,” says Daley.
The couple had a son in June – Robert Ray Black-Daley – as a result of which the perspective of Daley’s size – has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, my life would have run around winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than a golden Olympic medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.
His son was named after Daley's father, who died in 2011, only 40 years old from brain cancer.
Daley said his father never accepted the fact that he would die, and one of the most recent things he asked Daley about the 2012 Olympic tickets.
\"I couldn't tell him he'd never be here anymore to be in the front door,\" Daley said.
“I kept him from the hand when his breath stopped. Only when he had really stopped breathing and he was dead, I realized he was not vulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
“I knew this was something I’ve been dreaming about all my life – jumping in front of my home audience at the Olympics.
This was also an inspiration for his first selection of songs – Heather Smodel’s song ‘Proud’ – which made me feel when he was preparing for the Olympics and still getting his skin on the chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs will be sent on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The Polish Mickelson Exchange Park on Saturday at Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson breaks the record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup round, but he must be disappointed to avoid a record round as an unfortunate performance in history.
Mickelson, who played every two years at a record 12 times, was transferred to the exchange bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the duration of the fourball and the foursome to play on Saturday.
In general, the American five-time Major tournament winner, who is at the center of the attention, now spent half of the day as a cheerleader and on the other side of the field trying to beat him.
A 48-year-old Mickelson, who was not even considered to be one of the most accurate drivers of his career, is not an ideal choice for a tight Le Golf National field, where a long-growing bearer is punished for inaccurate punches.
If you don’t have enough against Mickelson in the field itself, in the 9th Sunday game, the British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who plays together with the incomeist Tommy Fleetwood, who aims to put all four wins in the pipe this week.
If Americans who are four points behind 12 double games get a flying start, Michelson's game can prove extremely important.
Furyk has expressed confidence in his player, but whatever else could be said.
“He perfectly understands the role he played today, and he killed me on the back, rusty, and said he was ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
He has a lot of self-confidence.
He belongs to the best players without doubt and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought of something else, but I saw this go and we ended up with this kind of solution.
He wants to be in that field as much as anyone else.
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldon's record of several Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It can also mean the end of a man’s Ryder Cup career, which, however, was never comparable to his personal performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven halves, but Furykin said his presence brings something undefined to the team.
\"He's funny, sarcastic, clever, keeps people at the expense of a joke, and he's a funny guy that everyone likes to do,\" he explains.
“The youngsters must have had fun with him this week, and it should be fun to watch.
He brings so much more to the team than just his bet in the game.
The European Team Captain Thomas Bjorn knows how long the leadership can disappear quickly.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that from Ryder Cup's command station before the last day's two-games can become a busy trip.
In 1997, the Danish player made his debut in Valderram, where Seve Ballesteros, led five points of leadership in the United States, but who made it a winner in the calcifices just and just at the scale of his nose and won with the highest possible margin from 141 to 2 to 31 to 2.
“It reminds itself of how we were re-introduced in Valderrama, we were re-introduced in Brookline, where we lost, but we won in Valderrama, though scarcely,” said Bjorn, after watching the 2018 team’s 5-3 wins both on Friday and yesterday, moving to the 10-20 leadership in Le Golf National Field.
History will show me and all other members of the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow we'll shoot with a big caliber.
We're going to the field and we're doing everything right.
The game is not over until the numbers are on the board.
We have a goal, we try to win that prize, and we only aim at it.
As I have always said, I will focus on these 12 players who play on our side. However, we are aware of what is opposite: the best players in the world.
Glad to see how the players of his team have been out of a difficult field, Bjorn adds: “I will never lick until he falls in such things.
Tomorrow is a completely different thing.
Tomorrow we will have individual performances, and then we will talk about different things.
It is great to be on the field with a partner when everything goes well, but when the field is on its own, the player’s capacity will be tested to the bottom.
This is a message that needs to be delivered to players – tomorrow everyone will be able to perform the best.
Now, we have to give up a partner who can also go to the field alone and do their best.
Unlike Bjorn, Captain Jim Furyk of the opposite will become better performers as individuals than they were able to partner with, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points from four.
Furyk, on the other hand, has experienced the last-day full-time translations in both directions. He was involved in a team won in Brookline before he ended up a loser when the European team won the \"Medinah's miracle\".
“I remember every word of the evil, he answered the question of how Captain Ben Crenshaw of the 1999 team extended his team’s ranks to the last day’s home.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start just like we did in Brookline, or as happened in Medinah.
When it moves in one direction, it will gain a great deal of pressure on the mid-range games.
We have regulated our assembly accordingly and put the boys on the field in the way we want, as you know, we are going to do miracles tomorrow.
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the battle of defense and he encounters Roy McIlroy in the main game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are in order to meet their European opponents.
“I put the group's friends in this order because I think it will carry the whole tournament through, Bjorn commented on his two-game choices.
Germany's new warship will be delayed again.
The German Navy's latest frigate should have been introduced in 2014 to replace the ageing fleet from the Cold War, but it will be introduced at its earliest next year due to defective systems and explosive costs, local media media will report.
According to a military journalist speaking to Die Zeit, the launch of the first ship of the Baden-Württemberg Fregatti class ‘Rheinland-Pfalzin’, has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was to join the fleet in 2014, but the worrying post-delivery problems have persecuted an ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg ships ordered in 2007 are intended to replace the ageing Bremen-class Fregates.
According to the available data, they are equipped with efficient cannons, missile systems for the control of aircraft and surface ships, as well as with tail technology, such as radar reflectivity, and infrared and acoustic signal detection technology.
Important features of the ship also include its longer service interval – new frigates should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without going to home port.
However, ongoing delays mean that the high-tech warships, which are said to have increased German influence in overseas areas, are already outdated at the time when they enter service, the Die Zeit magazine notes.
The bad-luck F125-fregatt ended last year when the German Navy formally refused to use the platform and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the ship returns after it has been delivered.
For reasons of return, little is known, but the German media has talked about essential software and equipment defects, which make the warship an ineligible combat task.
The lack of software is particularly important because the size of the crew of the Baden-Württemberg-class ships is around 120, which is only half of the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it appeared that the ship is significantly overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the fleet’s potential for later updates.
The Rheinland-Pfalz, which has a capacity of 7,000 tonnes, is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used in the Second World War in Germany.
In addition to defective equipment, the entire project’s price list is also developing a problem.
The price is estimated to rise to a staggering amount of EUR 3.1 billion when the original price was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of accessing new frigates have arisen when the German maritime power has recently been warned of shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee earlier this year, pointed out that the fleet's useable ships are at a low level.
According to the authorities, the problem has grown over time because old ships have been removed, but no new ones have been provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could be used by the Navy.
The environmental organization is listening to the secret life of toys.
A new study in the area at the top of Scotland seeks to find out how the bats exploit the terrain when they hunt for food.
The new study is hoped to bring new light to the behavior of these unique flying mammals and to guide the future conservation measures.
The research carried out by the scientists of the National Trust for Scotland is carried out by the effort and dwarf packaging, as well as substitutes and water wings in the Inverewe Garden area of the Botanical Garden in Wester Ross.
In the study, special storage equipment will be placed on the important points of the area to monitor the operation of the boxes during the period.
The organisation’s employees and volunteers also perform mobile measurements using portable surveillance devices.
The frequency of voting and the extent to which the species are concerned shall be ensured by an analysis of experts.
Based on the results, an environmental map and a report will be created in which the behavior of the bats can be presented in a picture that follows the region’s scale.
Rob Dewar, the organization’s natural protection adviser, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are the most important for bats, and how different species use them.
Knowledge is helpful in the design of habitats, such as the creation of meadows and the management of forest areas, taking into account jaws and associated species.
Scotland and the UK as a whole have decreased significantly over the last 100 years.
Construction and construction works threaten the resting sites and living environments of the toilets.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as fly paper and certain chemicals used in building materials, as well as attacks on pet cats.
Resters aren’t blind, actually.
However, due to the hunting methods in the night, their ears will benefit more from catching the prey than from the eyes.
Toys use advanced echoing technology to detect insects and obstacles on their flight path.
National Trust for Scotland is an organization focused on the protection of the rural environment, which maintains more than 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 acres across the country – and they take seriously rest.
It employs ten experts who regularly conduct surveys, inspections of rest places and, in some cases, rescue operations for animals.
The organization has even established the first and only one of Scotland's safe areas for the protection of bats in the area of Dumfries and Galloway. Eight of the 10 alkaline oils in Scotland will be met in the area.
Dr. David Thompson said the area is ideal for bats.
\"Threave is very well suited to the bats,\" he says.
“We have old buildings and trees, and all in all a good living environment.
We don’t know everything about the rest, so our work here and in other organizations will help us understand what the resters need to succeed.
He emphasizes the importance of checking the buildings for restocks before taking up renovations, as the destruction of one resting place can intentionally lead to the death of up to 400 females and boys and destroys the entire local population.
Restorations are protected animals and their killing, disrupting or destroying rest places are prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the Toy Protection Organization, encourages the public to participate in the defence work.
He says: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we still don’t know how their populations are doing.
Ronaldo denies rape charges while lawyers prepare a lawsuit against the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has identified rape charges as a fake news for him, and says that people want to advertise themselves by using his name.
Ronaldo’s lawyers have implemented claims to challenge the German Der Spiegel magazine.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of rape by an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is claimed to have paid $375,000 for his silence, Der Spiegel reports on Friday.
Ronaldo appeared in Instagram direct transmission to 142 million followers only hours after the claims were made. 33-year-old footballer strongly resisted the accusations and described them as \"new\".
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today, fake news, five-time Ballon d'Or, said to the camera.
They just want to advertise themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, it belongs to this profession.
I'm a happy man, and everything is fine, the player continued smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to challenge Der Spiegel's claim that they have called the Reuters news agency \"ineffective reporting of suspicions of privacy protection\".
The lawyer Christian Schertz says the player is demanding a refund of the psychological sufferings in accordance with the seriousness of the infringement, which probably means the serious violation of personal rights over the past years.
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorgan are reported to have met at the nightclub and moved to the player’s room, where he is claimed to have raped this anonymously, according to the papers submitted by Nevada Clark County Regional Court.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo had fallen to his knees after the alleged event and reported that he was a 99% good type, but one percent of which was a disappointment.
According to the documents, Ronaldo has confirmed a couple of people having sex, but it was a mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that he had visited the police station and took photos of his injuries in the hospital, but later ended up in a conciliation settlement, because he was “in fear of the possibility of revenge and of concern” to be subject to public humiliation.
A 34-year-old says he is now seeking the annulment of the conciliation procedure, because he has still traumatized the alleged event.
Ronaldo was close to the deal to move to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged overthrow of Manchester United, and moved to the Italian power team in Juvenus with a $100 million deal.
Brexit: The UK would regret forever – the end of car manufacturing
The UK would be forever, if it lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, the Minister of Economic Affairs, Greg Clark, said.
He added that he considered it to be a caring one – Toyota’s United Kingdom unit’s notice to temporarily suspend production at its factory near Derby in Burnaston if the UK withdraws from the EU without an agreement.
\"We need a deal,\" Clark says.
The Japanese car manufacturer says that the impact of border delays will be seen as a loss of jobs if Brexit is terminated without a contract.
A factory in Burnaston, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, with 90% being exported to the rest of the European Union.
“It is my view that if Britain suddenly leaves the EU at the end of March, our factory will be interrupted,” says Marvin Cooke, CEO of the Burnaston unit in Toyota.
Other car manufacturers in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, has announced that it will close its Mini factory for a month when Brexit is completed.
The main concern is that the car manufacturers report risks related to the supply chain in the implementation of an uncontractual Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is run with the timely JOT principle, where parts arrive at the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers from the UK and the EU, and cars are made from the order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it can cause disruption at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Maintaining a sustainable warehouse for more than a day at Derbyshire factory is impossible, according to Toyota, and production would be discontinued.
Clark says Theresa May’s EU relations plan is carefully calibrated to avoid these checks at the border.
“We need a deal, and we want the best possible agreement, which does not just mean success in the current situation, but it’s an opportunity that we need to take advantage of,” he says in the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
“Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers’ statements show that we must definitely be able to continue the series of very well-functioned supply chains.
Toyota cannot tell how long production should be stopped, but warns that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvalris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and works as a trade union operator at the factory, says: “My experience shows that the jobs lost will never return.
“We have to present an accurate and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein might be delayed again, the White House announces
The challenging meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein may be postponed again a week ago, due to the obligation of the Supreme Court candidate, Mr. Brett Kavanaugh, on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who in turn investigates Russia’s involvement in elections, Trump’s contacts with assistants to Russia and the President’s possible activities to prevent justice.
There have been rumors in Washington over months about Trump's intention to separate the Deputy Minister of Justice, which would jeopardise the impartiality of Mueller's investigation.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reports to Rosenstein about the possibility of recording discussions with Trump, as well as the possibility of separation of the President on the basis of Appendix 25 to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein has denied the report.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting was to announce Rosenstein's resignation.
However, President Trump was at the time visiting the United Nations in New York, so the meeting was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he – not preferably – would separate Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed, because the date was brought together with the hearing of the Senate Committee on Justice, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation against Kavanaugh for a week, which continued to postpone the vote of the Senate plenary session.
Trump Press Manager Sarah Sanders performed on Fox News Sunday.
When he asked about Rosenstein’s meeting, Sanders said: “The number of days for this is not set. It could be next week, this week, it can still be postponed in a week due to everything else, due to what is going on in the highest court at the moment.
I always want to keep the press up-to-date.
Some journalists might disagree with this argument: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Newsman Chris Wallace asked for a reason.
Sanders says that the reason for the lack of press events is caused by other reasons than the objection to the TV suppliers’ ‘discussion’, but said, ‘I do not object to the fact that they are looking for attention.’
Sanders, however, made sense of the future of direct contacts between Trump and the press.
“The president holds more questions than any president before him,” he says, and adds further evidence of the book: “We have checked those numbers.
“The conference will continue to be organised,” Sanders said, but “it will be infinitely much better if the media have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States than to talk to me.
We are often trying to act this way and you have seen us act this way several times over the past few weeks, and this will replace the press release so that you can speak directly with the President of the United States.
Trump will regularly answer questions when leaving the White House or taking part in open events or press meetings with guest values.
The presentation alone at the press conference is rare.
This week, in New York, the President may have shown the reason for this when he appeared incessantly and in time, strangely to the present journalists.
The Minister of Health wrote a letter to the staff of the Scottish public health system (NHS Scotland) from EU countries in relation to the concerns of Brexit
The Minister of Health has written a letter to the staff of the Scottish healthcare system from EU countries in order to express their gratitude and hope for their stay in the country after Brexit.
Member of the Scottish Parliament, Jeane Freeman, sent a letter while the time for the UK's withdrawal from the EU remains less than six months.
The Scottish Government is already prepared to cover the costs of applications for the established status of EU citizens working in specialised public services.
In his letter Freeman wrote as follows: During the summer, the differences between the UK and the EU have continued towards the expected decisions in the autumn.
The Government of the United Kingdom has also enhanced preparations for a possible non-contractual distinction.
I know that these are uncertain times for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat now how much we value each of our employees' contributions to citizenship.
Colleagues from all over and outside the EU bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve health care work and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie for emergency surgery
Tennessee State Tigers team supportman Christion Abercrombie has been in emergency surgery since the team was destroyed on Saturday 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Tennessee journalist Mike Organ.
Tennessee State’s chief coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury had occurred just before the middle of the day.
“He came to the sideline and simply got rid of it,” Reed says.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombi an oxygen at the sideline before placing him on couples and taking him to a more detailed assessment.
Tennessee State's editor told Chris Harris of the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had reached the Vanderbilt Medical Center hospital.
Harris added that there is no information about the type/exploitation of the infringement at this stage, and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a second-year student at Tennessee State University and plays for the first time in his team from Illinois after his transfer.
He had five cocktails on Saturday before leaving the game, which makes a total of 18 bars this season.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp tax when buying properties in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp tax when they buy properties in the UK. The extra money will be used to assist homeless people according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
The purpose of the change is to neutralize Corby's success in attracting young voters
The increase in the tax on stamps applies to those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Finance expects to collect up to £120 million per year – to help homeless people
Theresa May will inform foreign buyers of the higher stamp tax rates when buying properties in the UK.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters. Corby has made promises to more affordable housing and paid attention to the tax of return.
The increase in stamp tax is targeted at people and businesses that do not pay taxes to the UK, and the additional money from this will be directed at government measures to facilitate the unoccupied distress.
The additional fee, which is added to the current stamp tax two years ago, may be up to three per cent.
The Minister of Finance expects an increase of up to £120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13% of London’s new buildings will be purchased in non-UK by residents, which will increase prices and complicate the possibilities of first-family buyers on the ownership market.
Many wealthy areas in the UK, especially in its capital city, have become ‘a ghost shops’ due to the fact that many foreign property owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new line will only come weeks after Boris Johnson introduced a stamp tax reduction as a means of facilitating the purchase of young people’s first-place apartments.
He accused large construction companies that they would keep the prices of properties high by buying and leaving it unbuilding, and urged Prime Minister May to reject the quotas for low-cost housing in order to correct the disgraceful situation in Britain.
Corbyn has published a series of noticeable proposals for the reform of the housing market, including the restrictions on the mountains and the termination of the \"sacrificing weddings\".
He would also like to give the council more power in matters relating to the construction of new apartments.
Prime Minister May says: “I said last year that I was going to own my prime minister’s dream – that every generation’s life should be better than the return of its predecessor.
This means repairing our broken housing markets.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right that people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies abroad, can buy apartments as easily as British residents do.
Too many people having a home has become a dream far too far away, and the shame of homelessness remains a reality.
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland’s team.
Sunderland's leader, Jack Ross, says his \"permanent goal\" is to become a Scottish team manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish team is excited about the challenge of raising the country’s northeast corner back to their feet. The team is currently in the third place in the UK’s second division.
Ross moved to the “light stadium” this summer after he directed St Mirren back to Scotland in the last season.
“As a player, I wanted to play in my country’s team.
I got to team two, and that was it,\" Ross says in BBC: Scotland's Sports Sound.
“When I was a kid, I used to watch my father’s games with Scotland in Hampton, and that’s something that’s always pulled me back.
This opportunity will only be received if I succeed as a manager of the club.
Ross’s predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former director of Alloa Athletic says that he was not concerned about the entry of his nominal predecessors in his boots with a nameable club. He has previously rejected the offers made by Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
“Today, I’m going to measure my success with the fact that I can restore this club’s choice.
Based on the structure and ability of the club, it is undoubtedly part of the range, he says.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I’ll probably consider myself successful only if I can trust the team back to the chair.
Ross has only worked as a manager for three years: first as a Dumbarton assistant director and then for 15 months in the Heats coaching team.
He then helped Alloa rise from the three-row fall games and raised St Mirren’s falling condition as champions during the next season.
Ross says he feels better now than ever during his playing career in the teams of Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“I was probably on the roadside with my career, he remembers the time when he moved to the lead of Alloa.
“I really thought I was better suited to the manager than the player.
It sounds weird, because I played well, I made a good earn, and I got to enjoy some of the relatively big successes.
However, playing can be tough.
The player has to figure out a wide range of things every week.
I'm still going through the same things, like stress and pressure from work, but the team's leadership feels like it's the right task.
I always wanted to lead the team, and now I'm doing it for my job, and I feel better in my own body than ever in my adult life.
The entire interview will be listened to at Sport Sound on Sunday 30.9, Radio Scotland at 12:00 and 13:00 BST
Perfect time to enjoy the young one on Saturday at 5.30 p.m., research shows
The heat wave in the summer has fired the British pubs struggling with difficulties, but at the same time increased pressure on the chain of restaurants.
According to statistics, the sales of pub and bar chains increased by 2.7% in July, but the income of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a business consultant company from the CGA, said: “The continued sunny weather and the longer English-predicted participation in the football World Championships meant that July became more of a June-like pub when sales were 2.8% higher, while the month was worse for restaurants.
The fall of 1.8% in the sale of restaurants was only worse in July.
The most concentrated pubs and bars on the sides of the drink were successful. Their like-for-like sales grew more than the decline in the sales of restaurants.
Food-focused pubs also suffer from heat, but less dramatically than restaurants.
It seems like people just wanted to get out of their minds.
The sale of businesses’ round pubs and bars’ drinks increased by 6.6% over a month, and the sale of food was three per cent lower.
Paul Newman, a specialist in leisure and hotel restaurant services, says: “The results continue to be a trend that has continued since the end of April.
Weather and major social or sporting events are increasingly the major factors affecting the sale of the non-home catering market.
It is no surprise that the fight against the chain of restaurants continues, although the decrease in annual sales of 4.8% is tightening, especially now that the sector is currently struggling with cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come to the worse seam for the food-focused operators, and only the time to see if the brighter temperatures in the industry were to bring to the painfully needed breathtaking stage.
The total increase in sales of pubs and restaurants, including new open restaurants, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the creation of new brands.

A fifth of children hide social media accounts from their parents
A fifth of the children – some of them up to 11 years old – hide social media accounts from their parents and teachers, the study says.
The study of 20,000 higher school students revealed the existence of an increasing “Instagram” phenomenon
The news raised the concern that the accounts can share sexual content
20 percent of students said they liked a “head account” that is displayed to parents.
A fifth of the children – some of them up to 11 years old – create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
The study of 20,000 higher school students revealed the existence of a rapidly growing ‘Instagram’ feikki accounts, which refers to the Instagram site for the sharing of images.
The news has raised fears that sexual content can be published on accounts.
20 percent of the students told them to keep their clean ‘head account’ for parents to show while using other private accounts.
A mother found messages written by a teenager, in which she wished to be raped, when she ran into her 13-year-old daughter's secret site.
A study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Rectors’ Advisory Board (HMC) found that 40% of young people aged 11-18 had two separate profiles, and half of respondents admitted to secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of the HMC, says: “It’s very alarming that so many teens feel attracted to creating online spaces from which parents and teachers cannot find them.
Eilith Doyle – the sound of athletes – to the government of Scottish athletes
Eilith Doyle has been elected as a member of the Government of Scotland’s athletes as a member of the Board of Directors, who is part of the annual General Assembly of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most award-winning athlete in Scotland. The President of the Board Ian Beattie describes the appointment as a fine opportunity for sports decision-makers to benefit from the extensive experience of the athlete in the last decade.
“Elidith is greatly respected by athletes in Scotland, the UK and internationally. I am sure that Scottish athletes would benefit greatly from his appointment to government,” Beattie said.
Doyle says: “I look forward to my role as a sports fan and hope that I can be useful and help to guide the Scottish sport in the right direction.
Four American athletes who won the Olympic gold medal, who won 200 metres and 400 metres in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and who is now a regular commentator of the BBC, lost their ability to walk as a result of a transient brain circulation disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: \"A month ago, I got a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors say it's only time to show up, recover, and what's going on.
This has been a exhausting work, but I have recovered completely, learned to walk again and now to work on the agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages.
Moms cow-compatible ad to share opinions online
Breast pumping company nursing mothers breast-feeding a dairy cow advertising has shared opinions on the internet.
Elvie, who manufactures consumer technology, has brought on the market a product called “the world’s first silent and wearable breast pump” – its marketing is accelerated by a language made in the cheek and fashionable advertising of music videos, which describes the freedom of the new pump for nursing mothers.
Four real-life mothers danced in the laughter of the rabbits, among other things, saying: “Yes, I milk myself, but they don’t see him, and if you didn’t notice, they aren’t tures, but they’re tits.
The story continues: “Pray it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk it out, milk my flames.
However, the advertising published on the Facebook page of the company caused a debate online.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments have raised a conflict of reaction in viewers. Many say it will spoil the daily ‘wors’ of the dairy industry.
“The use of cows in advertising this product was a very bad decision.
They must become pregnant and give birth so that they can produce milk, but their babies will be stolen soon after childbirth, a commentator writes.
Elvie breast pump is an unnoticed fit in the breast-feeding lens (Elvie/Mother)
The second viewer said: “I understand that it is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why can't they be used to advertise a breast pump to mothers who can keep their baby?
The third commenter added: \"A complete reality-free ad\"
I also got the defenders: a woman admitted that she thought it was \"happy\".
I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one like that if I were still breast-feeding.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
Ads are a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
This is a brilliant product, reads one of the comments.
Another viewer commented: “This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who pump (often in the workplace or in the toilets) and feel like a cow.”
The purpose of the advertising is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry.
At the end of advertising, women of the video reveal that they have danced unnoticed pumps in their bras.
The concept of advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who use breast pumps feel like cows.
Elvie pump, instead, is completely silent, has no wires and hoses, and it fits unnoticedly in breast milk, giving women the freedom to move, holding the baby and even going out during pumping.
Ana Balarin, the shareholder and artistic director of Mother’s Advertising Office commented on the point: “Elvie Pump is a transforming product that earned a bold and provocative income on the market.
Breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows wanted to bring all the challenges related to the use of the breast pump into the spotlight, we brought the sense of incredible freedom of the new pump in an entertaining and comparable way.
The Elvie pump has been in the headlines before.
At London’s fashionians, the mother of two children appeared in the catwalk in the apartment of Marta Jakubowski, using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp on the Texas border in all silence
In spite of the fact that the monthly number of cross-border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, this is due to the fact that the use of the rough rhetoric and policy adopted by Trump administration has made it difficult to invest children in the foster families.
Most foster families are traditionally made up of paper-free immigrants, and registration as a foster family can endanger their own stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential substitute families and other adult members of the economy must provide their fingerprints and that this information will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a high-level immigration and customs authority, proved in Congress last week that dozens of people had been arrested by the Agency who had applied for foster families with minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested did not have a previous criminal record.
“At least 80% of people who are either members of the foster family or members of their households are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminals.
So we keep looking for these people,\" Albence says.
In order to speed up the handling of children's cases, the authorities have introduced new rules according to which, in some cases, the case must be dealt with in the court within a month of the date of detention, rather than the 60 days earlier, the employees of the reception centre shall report.
Many people prefer to perform through a video conference rather than personally in the case of immigrants.
Those who are not considered entitled to help are promptly expelled.
According to reports published by the employees of reception centres and the system in recent months, the time spent in prison for children affects whether children are starting to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent breakdowns or forced attempts.
According to the lawyers, the concerns are especially pronounced in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs of child despair can be overlooked due to the large size of the facility.
They add that the transfer of children to tent cities without giving them enough time to prepare for it emotionally or with good-bye friends can cause trauma, and that many of the children already suffer trauma at the moment.
Syria orders the U.S., France and Turkey to leave immediately.
At the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the country has been fighting for eight years.
Mr Moualem, who also acts as Prime Minister, said that the foreign troops were in the country illegally using the excuse of the fight against terrorism, and that, \"they will be acting in accordance with it,\"
\"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,\" he said to the General Assembly.
\"The war against terrorism is almost over passed in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died in 2011 and since then, and where millions of people have been forced to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to fight until the whole of Syria was cleaned of both terrorist organizations and settlements of foreign troops.
The United States has about 2,000 troops invested in Syria, where they are mainly training and guiding Kurds and Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has invested the battles to tear over 1,000 military units.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said the circumstances were good for returning and accused the Western countries of spreading the anti-irritational fears that encourage refugees to stay away from the country.
“We have invited the international community and assistance organisations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They’re making a policy that should be purely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be granted to Syria before the end of the war has been agreed between Assad and the opposition by political agreement.
According to the UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone at the last base of rebels in Idlib has created an opportunity for political debate.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack on the Syrian forces supported by Russia, with three million people living.
However, Moualem has stressed that the agreement has clear time limits and expressed the hope that military action would be directed at the jihadists, including the al-Nusra front fighters associated with al-Qaeda, which will be destroyed.
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon be able to convene the first meetings of the Committee of the New Government and of the opposition to establish a draft post-war Syrian constitution and to level the road for elections.
Mr Moualem set the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the Committee, saying that its work should be limited to the revision of the provisions of the present constitution and warned of any confusion.
Why Trump is elected for another season
In line with this logic, President Trump would win the 2020 elections unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope for, formalisation and scandal to decide his presidency in advance.
This would undoubtedly be the decision of the dramatic presidency.
No signs of fatigue have been observed in viewers so far.
Since 2014, the figures for the best viewing time have doubled by CNN to 1.05 million and almost tripled by 1.6 million MSNBC.
According to Fox News, on average, Nielsen has 2.4 million viewers compared to 1.7 million back four years, and the MSNBC Rachel Maddow Show has reached cable TV: top-class 3.5 million viewers in the main news show.
“This is a rush that attracts people, because it’s something we don’t understand, the final producer of ABC Designed Survivor, Neal Baer, says of the minister, who becomes president of the destroyed congress building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and book Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, is another theory.
He remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Scovell asked why.
The driver said, \"Because he makes me laugh,\" Scovell says.
The chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, apart from other TV programs, news from Washington can determine how Roe vs. Wade works, whether the members of migrant families can create each other and how the world economy can.
Independence is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, outside the obligation of the well-known citizens, it takes six hours to look at the expert panel arguing about the use of Bob Woodward's source data for Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 strutskin pilot jacket (Washington Post) – according to the above-mentioned report, “Washington Post’s supersensory is a cover of clothing, and Stormy Daniels’s President Trump’s anatomy’s anatomy-related unspeakable illustrations.
For example, I can never look at Super Mario in the same way as before.
“What he does feels like a true TV program because it’s partly about giving the audience something every night,” says the director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the Pantilaamamo series Brent Montgomery Trump’s show of changing individuals and daily trends (NFL-Rita, Kim Jong-un’s praise).
You can't miss any episodes, or you're gonna fall off the cart.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, he had a wonderful sunny day on the northern coast of Kaai, but he couldn't go out because he looked at MSNBC while laughing at CNN.
He could not withdraw from the program in which Brett Kavanaugh was in front of the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs and was the future of the highest court.
\"I remember when we did all those crazy programs and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,\" Mr. Fleiss said.
I thought it was a joke, but they were right.

From the outside, money flows to a tight mid-range shooting
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania has faced a real cash flow, as due to the reorganization of the congressional districts, two candidates who have already been elected will have to fight from one place.
This newly re-established Pittsburgh electoral district is a battle challenge for Democrats Conor Lamb, who took place in the special elections last spring.
Lamb competes with another elected candidate, Keith Rothfus, currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is overlapping with the new 17th electoral district.
The division was re-established after Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court decided in January that the old district would favour Republicans in violation of the Constitution.
The competition in the new 17th election has been launched by the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) and the Democratic Campaign Committee of the main parties.
Lamb's name became widely known in Pennsylvania after the 18th Congressional election of Pennsylvania.
The place had been with the Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won 20% in the area.
Political commentators have been a great step forward for the Democrats.
The United States planned a penalty for El Salvador for supporting China, but withdrew from its intentions.
The diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already listed the situation in Beijing and the mild response to Washington.
President Trump had a warm-hearted meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and he also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization Group's management team.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs officials decided to call American diplomatic officers back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of the silent lines that said Taiwan would no longer be recognized, said Heather Nauert, a spokesman in his statement earlier this month.
However, only El Salvador was considered, which received $140 million from the United States in 2017, including drug control, as well as development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in economic assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have severely hit the Central American State with a high level of unemployment and death.
In the course of the internal meetings, the North and Central American authorities postponed the high-level meeting on security and economic prosperity, and the corresponding meeting of the previous year was seen as a step in attempts to prevent migrants from reaching the United States.
In mid-September, however, high administrative officials made it clear that the meeting was wanted to progress and that this effectively decided speculation about the possible punishment of El Salvador.
The vice president, Mike Pence, is now expected to give an early mid-October meeting some sort of sign of emphasis on what kind of weight management would give to the meeting, the diplomats said.
These three American ambassadors returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic in all silence without any new bad messages or punishments from Washington.
Bolton's White House spokesman refused to comment on the details of the conversation with three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal issues anonymously.
Their report confirmed the external analyst close to the administration, which also spoke about the protection of anonymity.
History Teachings
The next inevitable step may be the report by Special Lawyer Robert Mueller on the possible prevention of President Trump's right, which now has very serious evidence in public documents.
Mueller has also been reported to investigate whether Trump’s campaign is in secret with Russia when Russia became involved in the US elections.
If power changes in Congress, President Trump will find himself accountable to it just as he prepares to go back to his constituents and possibly be judged by his peers.
There are a lot of whispers here, and I am not saying that President Trump's loss would be inevitable, more than the loss of similar people in Europe.
We need to make solutions on both sides of the Atlantic, and these solutions determine how long this struggle will be.
In 1938, the German authorities would have been ready to drop out of Hitler's power if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the massacre of the following years.
The course of history goes to such places where the inevitable march of democracy is either accelerating or delayed.
The Americans now face a number of such translations.
What do we do if President Trump separates Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, responsible for investigating the Mueller case?
Rosenstein has been silenced since he became aware of the fact that he had proposed a secret record of the President's speech and thought about the possible inability of the President to manage his duties.
According to Rosenstein, The Times's report is incorrect.
“How do we respond if a recent FBI investigation into the activities of Brett Kavanugh is not complete or fair – or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite the credible claims of sexual harassment and dishonest witness?
And above all, do we vote in the interim elections for Congress, which holds President Trump responsible?
If we fail in these homes, our democracy will last for a long and dark winter.
But I believe in our success in Prague because of my lesson.
My mother was a Jew in Czechoslovakia and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government that once filled my diplomatic bag.
He survived, moved to America as an immigrant, and sent me 60 years later to set fire to the Sabbath candles on the table decorated by that hammer.
How can I be more than optimistic about the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans as an optimist for Rapid Vienna
Rangers encounters their home in Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that in the same month in Spain, after the game against Villarreal, the victory of the Austrians would give the team a strong position to reach the G-block of the European League.
The knee injury prevented the midfield player Graham Dorrans from accessing the field this season before the Villarreal 2-2-games, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a popboard for better results.
“It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good answer, a 31-year-old player says.
“We went to the game with the expectation that we could get something and bring a point with us.
We may have been able to catch the victory at the end, but overall the tie-up is probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we got on the other side, and we were better.
Thursday is again an important evening in Europe.
I hope we get three points, but it will be a tough game because their results were good in the last game. However, I believe that with the support of this group we can give everything we can and achieve a positive result.
Last year was really hard on what would happen to my injuries and changes in the team, but now the situation feels good.
The assembly is good and the boys enjoy; the training is smooth.
I hope we can now press full, leave behind the past season and succeed.
Fear of saving lives takes women to sleep
Although research participants had a clear view of how they wished to take care of themselves, only a few had spoken to their loved ones.
About half of the country-wide study participants reported that they were discussing the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10% of respondents said they talked about it with their children.
“People want family members to take care of them, but they don’t talk about it,” says Holly Snyder, Vice President of the National Life Insurance Company.
Start like this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell them about your wishes in time.
Discuss with your professional and family about where and how to get help, as these questions are an important cost-setting factor.
Take economic advisors into consideration in the debate: advice can also help to find a way to cover these costs.
Long-term care options may include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance to cover these costs or self-catering insurance if you have a reserve.
Write legal documents: prevent disputes.
Get a healthcare representative in the place so that you can appoint a trusted person to monitor your medical treatment and ensure that professionals follow your wishes in case you are unable to communicate with them.
Consider also drawing up a charter for the management of your financial affairs.
It allows you to determine the trusted person to take care of financial decisions for you and to ensure that your invoices will be paid if you are unable to take care of them yourself.
Also, remember the small details: imagine that your elderly parents would be on their way to the hospital because of a healthy emergency.
Could you answer his questions about medication and allergies?
Write such information into the plan so that you are prepared for the situation.
“It’s not just for economics, who’s his doctor, Martin asks.
What medicines are used?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Keep the plan ready.

Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunamis that hit the city of Suzanne on Friday. According to the authorities, the number of victims is expected to grow.
Since the communication connections in the area are cross-border, the rescue authorities have not received any information about the area of the municipality of Donggala in the north of the Please, which is closer to the area of 7.5 magnitous quakes.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated since the disaster.

Federal prosecutors are considering imposing a rare death penalty on the NYC suspected of a terrorist attack.
The U.S. prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for the suspect of Sayfullo Saipov, a terrorist attack in New York City's eight lives, a rare punishment that has not been executed in the state since 1953.
According to the accusation, Saipov, 30, used Home Depot's rental car in a local attack on the West Side Highway bike in the south of Manhattan, where he was driving on pedestrians and cyclists.
According to the New York report on the death penalty for the southern administration, the death penalty is possible if the prosecutors are able to prove that Saipov killed - objectively - eight of his victims and caused - objectively - serious physical injuries.
According to the case-law, both of these charges can be imposed on the death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, the federal law imposed a 22-point charge on Saipov, including eight murders for the assistance of the terrorist organisation. The prosecutors of the federal state typically use this term of crime in cases of organised crime. In addition, the charges included a charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles,
The attack called for “observious planning and preparation, the prosecutors said and described the way in which Saipov carried out his actions as an atrocious, cruel and disgraceful”
“Sayfullo Habibulavic Saipov caused injuries, harms and loss to the families of Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadtin, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlijin, Hernan Ferruchin, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Aleksandro Damian Pagnucco,” the statement states.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The previous time, when the right of the southern administrative district of New York has given the death penalty, has passed for a decade.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually convicted of life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last enforced in New York in the federal case in 1953, when the marriage couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed as convicted of the conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the law documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not show signs of repentance during the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators what he did seemed good, the police told me.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired by his attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
The police said Saipov also wanted an ISIS ticket in his hospital room.
He responded to a 22-point charge of being innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal defence attorneys representing Saipov, said the defense was “naturally disappointed” with the decision of the prosecutor.
“We believe that the decision to demand death penalty and not recognition and life sentence without the possibility of liberation is a solution that only prolongs the trauma caused by these events to the parties,\" Patton said.
Saipov's defense had previously asked for no death penalty.
The Conservatives said that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised today in protest against conservatives to mobilize a civil army.
Former Ukrainian leader said that politicians must know the pressure of Eurosceptics - when one of Theresa May's own parliamentary representatives suggested to lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, the Conservative Liner, told the marchers in Birmingham that the UK would already be outside if Farage were a Brexit secretary.
But May will face their deeply divided lines by agreeing to the challenge of remaining conservatives who joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep Chequers on the surface of his proposal for compromise on the brexit supporters and opponents, as well as on the EU's squeeze.
The supporters call on him to continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the fall, and to force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to make a choice between his proposal and chaos.
Bone said, at the Leave Means Leave event in Solihull, he wants the Chequers proposal to go away.
He suggested that Farage should be included and should be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
\"If he had been in charge, we would have been outside,\" he said.
Wellingborough's MP added: \"I'm talking about Brexit, but we need to get rid of Chequers' proposal.
He said in response to the EU: “We did not fight world wars to end up subdued.
We want to lay down our own laws in our own country.
The idea that public opinion would have changed since the 2016 vote: “It is a completely wrong claim that the British have changed their minds and would like to remain.
Andrea Jenkyns, a conservative brexit advocate, also participated in the march and said to the reporters: “Sanon only: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people do not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote for it, neither will it be supported by party members nor by activists who really go to the streets and are, above all, responsible for our success.
Quit the Chequers proposal and start listening.
In a message addressed to May, he added: “The ministers are allowed to keep their jobs when they keep their promises.
Farage said that politicians need to feel pressure if they are going to spin the 2016 referendum decision.
This is about confidence between the people and the political class, he said.
\"They're trying to water Brexit, and we're here today to tell them we don't accept it.\"
Speaking to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want politicians who are about to spin the brexit to feel pressure from you.
“We are going to mobilize the army of citizens of this country, which gave us victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until the UK is again an independent, self-rule and proud state.
Meanwhile, the supporters marched through Birmingham before a two-hour event in the city center.
A small group of activists waved “Tories Against Brexit” signs. The group was founded this weekend.
The Labour Party Lord Adonis mocked the conservative security problems that they had with the party’s application at the beginning of the meeting.
“These are the people who say they’re getting IT systems in order to improve and all technology for the Canadian plus plus arrangement, and the unrivalled border operations for free Irish trade,” he added.
\"It's a full fart.
There's no good Brexit, he added.
Warren is seriously considering the presidential nomination.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says he is seriously considering a presidential nomination after November.
The Boston Globe reportedly spoke about the future of the Masschustist Democrats at the city hall in the Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is known for his repeated criticism of President Trump, encounters the latest Republican Geoff Diehl in November, a joint president of the 2016 Massachusetts campaign of Trump.
Warren has been suspected to be a candidate against Trump in the 2020 election.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoki was with his 36th city-house voters after the beginning of Trump's season.
One participant asked if Warren was going to be president.
Warren replied that it is now time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and that includes a woman in the highest place.
Arrested in the LSU Sims shooting
Louisian Baton Rouge Police reported that they arrested a person on Saturday, suspected of shooting a Friday after the death of an LSU basketball team player, Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge police announced Dyteon Simpson's arrest at 11 a.m. on the morning at the ET alert.
The police had released a video of the Friday shooting scene and asked for help to identify the man in it.
Sims, 20, was shot near Southern University campus area early on Friday.
\"Wayde Sims got shot at his head and died as a result, police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through 247 Sports networks.
Wayde defended his friend when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted that he was there in the interrogations, held the gun, and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson didn't do the resistance when he was arrested, and he was taken to East Baton Rouge's police station.
Sims was a 1998-cent junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games and 10 games in the last season and his average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 record balls per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after offering him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
When Valtteri Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became evident that Mercedes' team arrangements play an important role in the competition.
But Bottas got a good start from the stake and left Hamilton on almost his own well-being, defending his place in the first two rounds, inviting Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel went to the shadow first and left Hamilton to drive a bunch of tails that should have solved the situation.
Mercedes later went to the shadow and returned to Vettel, but Hamilton passed a bit after the contact and the Ferrari transporter moved in a similar way to the inner line, giving up his defence of his investment after his two third translations.
Max Verstappen, who spent his 21st birthday, began with the backstrays and was the seventh after the first round.
After that, he was in charge of a large part of the competition when he extended the exchange of tires in order to quickly stop and take the fourth place from Kimi Räikkös.
He finally came to the shadow in the 44th round, but could not increase speed in the remaining eight rounds when Räikkönen took the fourth place.
This was a difficult day, because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman when he got past me.
The team has done an exceptional job in reaching a double win, Hamilton said.
Very bad body language
On Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein's claim that he did not leak to the public a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, in which he accused the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
When speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not mention the certificate of Ford's testimony to the Senate in front of the Committee on Justice, but stated that what was going on in the Senate was an indication of the human-sacrifice, shame and dishonesty of the people.
“The one possible thing, the wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate for the past few days, when we see the rage, the people that are angry, the mean, the shy, and the dishonest,” the president said.
“When we see publications and bedtime things, and then they say ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it.\"
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you been doing this for years?
Do you remember his answer... years of document-- oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't bleed.\"
Wait a minute.
No, we didn't leak, he added the Senator to the water.
Feinstein received a letter in July describing the charges for Ford Kavanaugh and the letter was leaked to the public in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have occurred in his office.
\"I didn't hide Professor Ford's accusations, and I didn't leak his story,\" Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential in accordance with his wishes.
But his ban was not acceptable to the president, who commented on the matter on Saturday’s occasion: “I tell you that it was very bad for the body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that was the worst thing I ever saw in the body.
The President continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate, accused by three women of sexual harassment and believed that Democrats would use accusations for their own benefit.
“They have decided to return to power by whatever means.
You'll see that meanness and shame, they don't care who they hurt or who they have to walk over to get in power and control.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars applied for compensation for the loss of the Elite League match against the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning the 5-3 Dundee on Saturday.
Giantse had a leading position in the early stages due to the two goals made by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team to levels before Dwyer returned the Giants station.
Francois Bouchard leveld Dundee before the two goals of Lukas Lundvald confirmed victory.
This was the third Elite League defeat for Adam Keefe's men who won the dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
The teams met the fourth time during the season three previous games won by Giants.
Dwyer's opening painting came in four minutes from Kendall McFaul's feed. David Rutherford fed when Beauvillier doubled the lead station four minutes later.
During the shady opening season, Sullivan brought home the team back to play at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt fed the Cowni scale in the time of 15:16.
Dwyer assured Giants for the first break in the lead position when he hit his second goal of the evening at the end of the first round.
The team gathered his line, and Bouchard was again levelled on the high-power ground in the time of 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined their forces, and Nielsen was able to make the first lead painting for Dunde at the end of the second round. He also assured victory in the fifth goal of his team in the middle of the last round.
Giants, who have now lost four out of five of their last games, will be facing their next home on the Friday of Milton Keynes.
The pilot died to ensure that hundreds of passengers on the plane escaped an earthquake.
In Indonesia, the pilot has become a hero since he died in order to ensure that hundreds of passengers carried the aircraft safely into the air.
More than 800 people have died and several people are missing after a strong earthquake and its tsunami attack on the island of Sulawes on Friday.
Powerful postquakes test the area, and many people have been trapped in a trapped material in the city of Please.
Although colleagues fled the store, the 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung did not leave his job at a wildly floating air traffic control tower at Mutira Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in position and made sure that the flight of Batik Air on the runway was safely aired.
After that, he jumped out of the air traffic control tower he thought was about to fall.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said that the Aung decision could save hundreds of lives, the Australian ABC News news broadcast.
Kalimantan's Ballipapapan was made by a helicopter to carry him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
\"This news breaks our hearts,\" he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of victims will grow to thousands, as the country's disaster authorities have reported a lack of contact with the cities of Donggala, Sigin and Boutong.
“The number of victims is believed to continue to rise because several bodies have been buried in ruins and many people have not been targeted,” said the agency’s spokesman Sutopo Purwo.
Even six-metre waves have been destroyed by Please, where mass gravers are held on Sunday.
Military and cargo equipment will bring assistance and equipment to the area.
A 35-year-old family mother Risa Kusuma told Sky News: #Ambullants bring bodies all the time.

Earlier this year, more than 550 people were killed in earthquakes in Lombok, Indonesia.
Microwave: According to Air Niugin, one person is missing when the plane is in the lagoon.
In the Pacific Ocean, the representatives of an airline flying the lagoon now report that one person is missing, although 47 passengers and crew members have been evacuated safely from a drowning plane.
According to Air Niugin, it has not been able to find one male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline announced that it would try to find a man in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and accident researchers.
The airline did not immediately answer any questions about the missing passenger information, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane was hit by water trying to land at Chuuk Airport.
On Friday, the authorities announced that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
According to the airline, six people stayed in the hospital on Saturday and all were stable.
The cause and the exact course of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have both reported aircraft landing in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had driven over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
“It’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
According to Jaynes, passengers were able to chain on a sinking plane in a stretch of water for emergency exits.
He told the passenger staff that he had panicked and cried, and that he himself had a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that the sailors involved in the repairs of a nearby harbourer were carrying people to the shore on a rubber boat before the plane sank into a deep water of about 30 metres (a hundred feet).
According to Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in the ruins of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the last two decades, but Air Niugini has not joined the market.
Analyst presents a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor completed a retreatment in which the man was accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified hours as an expert in the field of information analytics.
He described to the jury how he had used cell phone records when he collected one of the 29-year-olds-old Quinton Telis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers' movements on the night of the victim's death.
Rowlett told me that he had received the location information of several mobile phones that showed Telis was against his previous claims with Chambers the night he died, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the information showed that Tellis' cell phone was at Chambers at the same time that Tellis claimed to be his friend with Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling me the truth when he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford replied that Tellis was waving because my car was in Nashville.
Another incoherence was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Based on the data stored on the mobile phone, they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis removed Chambers text messages, calls and contacts from his phone.
\"He erased him from his life,\" Hale said.
The final speech of the defence is scheduled for launch on Sunday.
The judge said he would wait for the trial to proceed to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
Hip hop trio wants to challenge genre-related negative perceptions by making music full of positive messages.
According to the British Society of The High Breed, hip hop has moved away from the original message of which the messages were involved in political and social problems.
They want to go back to hip hop roots and make a known hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have been able to prove the UK’s new rise with artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another dark person?!
New York Nurse Challenges Couple Court Due to Racist Text Message
The New York Nurse challenges the couple’s right to discriminate against a discriminatory divorce after accidentally receiving a text message from the child’s mother, in which he complains that he is “one dark person.”
The couple denies being racist and parallels to the challenge of writing.
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed her thirty when the new babysitter Giselle Maurice arrived to work on her first working day in 2016 and was told that this was dark.
“EIIIIIII, I'm sorry, Mr Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to his husband.
Then he sent a message instead of his husband to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman, according to New York Post, had distinguished Maurice, stating that their previous departure passports had been treated badly by his African American babysitter and had been waiting for them to leave the Philippines this time.
Maurice got paid for one of his working days and was sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice challenges the couple's court to get a compensation for the divorce and wants 350 dollars per day for six months, from which she was initially washed to live and work in the family, though without a contract.
“I want to show them that you can’t do that, he said to the Post on Friday and added: “I know it’s discrimination.
The couple responded to the racist claims, saying that the termination of the Maurice’s employment relationship was a legitimate solution because they could not trust him after he had offended him.
“My wife sent him something he wasn’t supposed to say.
He's not racist.
We're not racists, Joel Plasco told us in a post interview.
“But would you leave your child to the kind of person you’ve been unfriendly to, even if by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Really...
Plasco faced the challenge of blackmail, and I said that his wife had had had had a baby two months before and was in a very difficult situation.
Are we going to hunt another one in this situation?
It's not very comfortable, the investment banker added.
Although the case is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple’s social media by divulging their behavior and logic.
The new letter reveals that Paddington publishers were afraid that the public would not identify the talking bear.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born a little after the book was approved, says in the letter: “It is difficult to live in the position of a person who read the book for the first time before the publication.
It's funny now that Paddington's huge popularity is known.
Noting that his father, who had worked as a cameraman of the BBC before his dedication to writing children's books about adventures in the toy bear, would have been optimistic about rejecting his book, Jankel added that the 60-year anniversary of the publication of the books seemed bitter because his father died in the previous year.
He described Paddington as a very important family member and said his father was silently proud of the success he had achieved.
“He was a very quiet man, and not a scrupulous type,” the daughter says.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as a child’s achievement to him; the one you are proud of, even though it is not really your own achievement.
I think he experienced Paddington's success in that way.
Even though it was his creation, he always honoured Paddington himself.
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
His daughter was praised for landing on the plane at the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors tried to save his life in vain.
“They didn’t matter a bit and told me the situation was really bad that he wasn’t expected to survive,” Ednan-Laperous said.
Then they called and said my daughter would die in a couple of minutes and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
So I did.
I said, \"I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm with you.
The medications that kept his heart running gradually disappeared from his body.
He died a little earlier, and now everything went away.
I could just sit there knowing that everything was about to end.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was in a situation where I had families and other people around me.
I had to keep myself together.
Finally, Ednan-Laperous, who died of her daughter's loss, ascended to the plane among other passengers, who knew nothing about the trial he was going through.
\"No one knew,\" he said.
“I kept my head down and tears all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt tremendous compassion for Nadia.
That he needed my love and understanding now.
I knew how much he loved my daughter.
Dead women send cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones work to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send cards with encouraging messages and phone numbers that can get support.
Davis' son Tyler was diagnosed with depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want anyone’s parents to experience the feelings I feel every day,” he said.
Davis, who lives in Lydney, 45, says his son was a promising cook with an infectious cold.
He was known for his smile.
Everyone said his smile was illuminating the whole room.
But he stopped his work before he died because he felt “in the darkness.”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother found his brother, who had lost his life.
Davis says he's constantly afraid of the consequences.
Davis created cards to tell people that there are people to talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't be quiet, you have to talk.
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies for several years and lost his partner Mark after 15 years of co-existence shortly after his mother died.
\"He didn't say he was down or depressed or anything like that,\" Humphreys said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was all in the country on Christmas day, and when the kids opened his gifts, he didn't take them into sight or anything like that.
He says Mark’s death was a difficult trauma for them, but they have to figure out what’s going on: “It’s breaking up the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we just need to keep living and fight forward.
If you are fighting with you, you can call Samaritans for free at 116 123 (UK and Ireland), send an email to already@samartans.org or visit the website.
The future of Brett Kavanaugh is at stake when the FBI starts its investigation.
\"I thought that if we could really achieve what he hoped - time and scope of border investigation - maybe we could achieve a bit of unity,\" Flake said on Saturday, and added that he was afraid that the committee would \"distribute\" its supporters' deadlocks.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want an FBI investigation?
Controversy is about timing.
The interim elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November, and if Republicans’ success is weak as expected, their efforts to get the man they want to be elected to the highest court in the country will be difficult.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called the Senators to loot them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during Bush and met his wife Ashley, a personal secretary of President Bush.
What happens after the FBI report is prepared?
In the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting, the vote will take place.
It is still unclear if Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, so Vice President Mike Pence could blow across the game and confirm his election to the highest court.
North Korea's number of locals falls during Kim's
According to the South Korean legislature, the number of South Korea’s North Korea-registered people has decreased since Kim Jong-un’s seven-year-old invasion.
Park Byeong-segug quoted the Ministry of Integration of South Korea and reported that there had been errors last year in 1 127 - 2011 in 2,706.
According to Park, decisive factors have been the tightening of border checks between North Korea and China, as well as the increase in prices of human smugglers.
Pyongyang has not been publicly commented on.
The majority of North Korea’s localities are eventually offered South Korea’s citizenship.
It is said that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most escape through China because it has the longest border with North Korea and it is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized zone between the Cores.
China treats locals as illegal immigrants, not as refugees, and most often returns them by force.
Further technically, the relations between North Korea and South Korea in the war have improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the countries met in Pyongyang, and the discussions focused on the negotiations that were in place.
This followed the June historic meeting, where US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un met in Singapore and agreed on a general level of effort towards the nuclear integrity of the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for being stuck in sanctions after the meeting.
“Without any confidence from the United States, our national security is not on a reliable basis, and under such circumstances, we are in no way unilaterally starting out our equipment as the first one,” Ri said to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh as a hystereric and inappropriate to act in the highest court.
Minority Director Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court Attorney-General Brett Kavanaugh to be a hysterical, and said this was temporarily inappropriate to act in the highest court.
He played a role in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin Texas.
“I couldn’t help thinking that if a woman had behaved like this, she would be called “hysterical,” Pelosi said in his own reaction to the testimony of Kavanaugh in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh very emotionally denied accusations that he would have sexually harassed Christine Blasey Fordia while they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was in the power of his feelings, and he almost cried and lost his ability to speak when he told his family and high school years.
He also clearly condemned the Committee's Democrats, without calling themselves \"grotesk\" and \"planned man-to-person persecution\", organised by liberals in the 2016 presidential election of Hillary Clinton.
The fear said he believed that the testimony of Kavanaugh proves that he was unable to act in the highest court because it showed him to be a party to the Democrats.
“I believe he did not understand himself in his opinions and in the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats,” Pelosi said.
He was afraid of asking him if he would be charged with an official charge against Kavanaugh if this choice was confirmed and if the Democrats were to receive a majority in the House of Representatives.
If he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not eligible not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he is currently working, Pelosi replied.
Kavanaugh is currently working in the U.S. Federal Court of Appeal.
He added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about the possible provisions of Kavanaugh regarding the health reform or the Roe v. Wade case, because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative justice user.
In his consultations on the verification, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would repeal certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It’s not a good time for a hysterical and biased person to be elected a member of justice and we would be expected to say it’s great,” Pelosi said.
Women have to get through everything.
This is a legitimate speech in the wake of the rage of months and years, and he is not allowed to cry.
\"We'll cry when we're angry,\" Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's unusual, or what you think...
He continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who was in a leading position somewhere and who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a way to say to her speech partner in a situation where she was angry and started to cry, “You may think I’m sad now because I’m crying.
I'm really mad.
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant.
The tears get justification as a route of extermination, although they are generally misunderstood in fundamental terms.
One of my most memorable memories of my early job in a man-dominated office is when I once cried of an unspeakable rage and an older woman - a cold-knit boss, which I've always feared - caught me from the neck and pulled me into the staircase.
\"Don't ever let them see you cry,\" he said.
They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad, and then they're happy because they got your sorry mind.
Patricia Schroeder, the congressman at the time from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on this presidential election campaign.
When Hart got caught in 1987 by a boat called Monkey Business and got out of the race, very frustrated by Schroeder Tuum that there was no reason why he would not try to be president himself.
“It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” he told me, laughing 30 years later.
“There were seven of them, and the least of them needed one more.
Someone called the situation “Lumks and the 7th dwarf.”
Since the campaign was already in a long time, he was behind the fundraising, and so he announced that he would not go to the race unless he got two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
He was told that some of his supporters who gave a thousand dollars to male candidates gave him only 250.
\"Do they think I'm getting a discount? He was thinking.
When he held his speech and announced that he would not start an official campaign, he was in charge of his feelings - of his supporters of gratitude, of a system of frustration that made it so difficult to raise funds for voters and for the election of delegates, and of anger towards sexism - that he could not speak.
\"You might have thought I'd get a nervous breakdown, Mr. Schroeder reminds me of the press's reactions.
You could have thought that Cleex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking that my gravestone must be hacked into a monumental writing.
“He cried.”
How the US and China trade war can benefit Beijing
The departure to the US and the Chinese trade war was capricious, and even though the battle is nothing but past, the country's outrage can benefit from Beijing in the long term, experts will observe.
U.S. President Donald Trump gave the first warning earlier this year by imposing import duties on the main Chinese export items, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
This week, the most significant number of escalatings occurred with the new customs duties that have an impact on imports from China for $200 billion (£150 billion), taxing effectively half of all products imported from China to the United States.
Beijing has responded every time on the same scale, by imposing five to ten per cent of customs duties on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States with an eye-eye style, and it does not seem that the world’s second largest economic power would be going to be a moment.
In order to be able to retreat, Washington should be allowed to recover from its own demands, but public worship to the United States would be far too degrading to the Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts note that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the US trade war can have a positive impact on China in the long term by reducing the dependence between countries.
“A long political decision can be made either in Washington or in Beijing, creating conditions that start an economic recession in one of the countries, and this is in fact a more dangerous opportunity than the side viewers have understood so far,” says Abigail Grace, a research assistant in Asia at the Center for New American Securities.
According to the Syrian Foreign Minister, the country is ready for the return of refugees.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country after a devastating war of more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions will improve in the country.
“Your situation is now more stable and safer because of the development of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government will continue to repair the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to restore the normal situation.
The conditions now allow the voluntary return of refugees to the country from which they were forced to leave for terrorism and their daily lives and livelihoods due to unilateral economic measures.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian assistance in the country.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would be grateful for the assistance of the reconstruction of the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from states that supported the rebels.
European team confirmed Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup with the U.S. team's final score of 16.5 against 10.5 Le Golf National in Paris outside of France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row in Europe, which has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team held the crown on its own when its Danish captain Thomas Bjørn’s team reached 14,5 points needed to win the United States.
American star player Phil Mickelson had difficulties almost throughout the tournament, and he hit his first shot in the water with a par-3-track on 16 holes, giving the match to Francesco Molinar.
Italy Molinari was shot at all the rounds and became one of the four players who has won the result of 5-0 ever since the tournament was launched in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth ended up fighting 5&4 European team's lowest-ranked player, Denmark's Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dust Johnson, a world’s top player, lost 2 and 1 to English Ian Poulter, who could now play the last Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cup golf veterans, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most successful European in all time with a total of 25,5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t do anything about it.
The year has been heavy.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to win this win.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be of help,\" Garcia said after the victory of the European team.
He's moving the bell to his landman Jon Rahm, who won the U.S. Golf legend Tiger Woods in 2+1 individual competitions on Sunday.
“I feel a tremendous pride after winning Tiger Woods, and I grew up to admire him,” said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup tour 13-21-3.
Strange statistics from one of the best players of all time, which has won 14 great wins and remains the second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had difficulty finding the highways all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, whose game was high throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk of the U.S. team said his team had failed the show: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
We pushed the European team into this morning's games.
We put it on.
Honor Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, work with our American PGA and Ryder Cup Committee and we will move forward.
These 12 guys are great and I'm proud to be their captain.
I need to get my hat up.
We met our winner...
Status of Red tide: concentrations fall in the areas of Pinellas, Manaste and Sarasatota
According to the latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, a general decrease in the number of spreads in the area of Tampa Bay is shown.
According to the FWC, more fragmented rest areas are reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier districts, which may indicate a decrease in concentrations.
Red tide is located on the coast for about 130 miles from Pinellas to southern Lee districts.
